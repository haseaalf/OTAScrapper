Kami mendapatkan welcome drink berupa wine dan coklat yang berisi wine (Very nyummy).\n\nPara karyawan dan karyawatinya memakai costum retro ala 70an. Dengan suasana lobi yang modern, memberikan paduan yang sangat unik. Sangat kreatif menurut kami.\n\nTak lama setelah kami check-in, kami disambut oleh Front Office Managernya Jessica Lee Cook. Beliau sangat ramah dan memberikan gambaran kepada kami yang kebetulan baru pertama kali ke daerah Seminyak tentang lokasi-lokasi yang dapat dituju dengan menggunakan taxi.\n\nSetelah kami menyelesaikan welcome drink and snack kami, kami dibawa oleh Bellboy yang merangkap Room Service (Sayangnya saya lupa namanya). Beliau juga sangat responsif dan ramah dalam menanggapi permintaan kami,\n\nRuangan yang kami tempati adalah Mayfair Sunset Studio, dengan salah satu balkoninya menghadap pantai. iPod yang dilengkapi dengan banyak pilihan musik, yang dapat disesuaikan dengan suasana yang diinginkan. iPad juga tersedia yang dapat digunakan untuk melihat pilihan menu breakfast, lunch, dan in-flight dining.\n\nDi dalam ruangan yang kami tempati juga terdapat mesin pembuat kopi dengan 3 pilihan jenis kopi (Recommended). Untuk yang rindu dengan suasana retro, cobalah menonton Brionvega TVnya. Tidak lupa juga untuk menyinggung suasana kamar yang sangat cozy dan bersih.\n\nKeesokan paginya, kami menikmati hidangan breakfast yang sangat luar biasa dengan banyak sekali pilihan menu ala-carte dan buffet. Untuk yang suka berenang, jangan lupa mencoba kolam renang di sini.\n\nMalam harinya, kami juga tidak lupa mencoba Lunaplex. Kebetulan pada saat malam tersebut kami menonton film Elf. Kursi malas yang nyaman dengan pilihan snack dan drink yang memuaskan.\n\nPada saat kami diminta untuk menuliskan satu nama karyawan/karyawati yang ingin disampaikan, kami kebingungan untuk menulis satu nama, berhubung semua karyawannya sangat ramah dan responsif!\n\nUntuk kunjungan ke Bali yang berikutnya, kami pasti akan balik ke sini lagi.\n\nLove,\nTanaka - Michelle",

I am glad to hear that your stay was an out-of-this-world experience, and that our team delivered in our goal to provide superstar service for you and your wife.\n \nAt Luna2 we know that our style, design and concept is funky, retro and as we say \u2018out-of-this-world\u2019 and it is not the traditional Balinese style hotel. We are so happy that you and many of our guests appreciate that Melanie Hall, Luna2 founder & designer, has created a ultra-chic studiotel where everything from the uniforms, rooms and d\u00e9cor is inspired with nostalgic, futurism or fun.\n \nThe entire team and management is grateful for your very kind review and we look forward to seeing you and your wife back for another visit to Luna2.\n\nBest regards \n\nJessica Lee Cook \nFront Office Manager",

              "text": "We were looking for a quiet place to relax away from the hustle and bustle and we definitely found it here.\nHidden in a small cul de sac, 2 mins walk to the beach and away from the noise but close enough to walk to the areas with restaurants and bars (10-15 mins) this hotel is perfect for a couple\u2019s retreat.\n\nDecor is really cool and funky, the pool is large, the rooftop bar gets a lovely view of the sunset. There is also a cinema room with reclining chairs and a bar- really cool concept.\n\nWe stayed in a studio apartment which was large, bright and clean. \n\nStaff were brilliant- very nice and helpful. We celebrated my husband\u2019s birthday there and they got us a cute wee birthday surprise cake after breakfast which was held in the rooftop bar that morning.\n\nBreakfast was tasty- choice of western dishes to order, small buffet of pastries/ fruit and coffee/tea.\n\nThe only service we didn\u2019t use was the transport due to their high prices- pick-up from the airport was quoted at IDR 450k (taxi cost us IDR 300k - 100k of that was due to the taxi driver conning out of us for an airport toll charge) and one way transfer to Ubud would have cost us 750k (Ubud hotel picked us up for IDR 350k- note, not a tour, just transfer).",

Unfortunately, our high expectations were not met.\n\nWe decided to book direct because the reservation matched the rate that was in OTA.  The responses from Made were prompt and friendly.  Good first impression. \n\nUpon check-in, we asked for the complimentary sunset cocktail and was immediately told it was not in our package although it was written on our booking confirmation.  After rechecking, they informed us that it was included but it was already past sunset time and we already made plans for dinner outside.\n\nThe property is not as great as we expected.  It is not big although the room is larger than most hotel rooms that we have stayed in Bali.  It is just a concrete without much warmth.  The room seems outdated. \n\nThe toiletries are simple.  They ran out of toothbrush on our first night.  \n\nService is ok.  \n\nLocation is not easy to reach by foot.  It is quite a long alley to reach from the main Seminyak road. \n\nWhat  we love  most from staying here is the beach which is about 2 minutes walk from the hotel. We just love walking along the soft sand. It was the highlight from our Seminyak stay. \n\nFor the price that we paid, it is not value for money. But, seeing the many 5* reviews, maybe we missed a few things from in this property.",

Stay there and just forget anything !\nThe food of the restaurant is very good, tasty and a touch fancy, the meal price is thus in agreement.\nThe private cinema is a big plus !\nThe atmosphere and the decoration of the hotel are quite unique, James Bond style (60s style).\nThe staff uniform is also inspired about it.\nThe top terrace offers a lovely view to the sea.\nThe room I had was woowww... Spacey, genuine, unique, comfortable, huge bathroom with separated shower and bathtub, despite bad TV signal (I didn't watch TV on holidays).\nLarge and comfy bed, effective AC. Balcony view to the swimming pool and to the beach on the left end side.\nThe sound system (iPOD included in the room) in the room is quite welcome to create your ambiant mood. An iPAD is also provided with all the hotel information included inside.\nThe price/quality ratio is awesome.\nVery enjoyable place ! I would definetly return there if I had the opportunity.\nAbsolutely recommended for couple, everything you need are there !\nWell done Luna2 !!",

They're a good size, have good amenities, shower etc and very quiet. Staff are fantastic and the location right beside the beach is handy (wander along the beach to pick out a breakfast place).  The swimming pool was  big and the food served  excellent.  The rooftop bar is also a  bonus. Overall we really enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it for a change from the \"normal\" Bali places.",

Open late, can be requested to be open later. Very clean, reliable and very shockingly great!\nYes great breakfast, drinks with stunning view, Bar restaurant, great prices view. Room design is going to blow your away but I guess not as much as excellent customer service and smiles everywhere. \n\n14 rooms gives your privacy and quiet, at the same time rooms are spacious and accommodating (like an apartment)...amazing how can you fit all in one?\nInteresting enough it suits families(movie theater, location, space) and couples(quite, next to nightlife view). You even have TV in your bath tub...\nDesign is  in such a way you won\u2019t need reservation for lounge outside near pool or just place to swim. Who designed this hotel is genius, but owner needs to advertise it more. It is so underestimated...wait maybe not or I won\u2019t have a place to stay, I will be here on vacation\u2026.lol\n\nThis is a designer hotel with stunning rooftop bar, impeccable service, excellent food (lamb is only from New Zealand, high quality, for example and you can have it over the weekend on rooftop), view almost anywhere. Free shuttle will accommodate where driver can take you, and they go above and beyond (spas recommendations/reservations, airport lounges, restaurant suggestions on budget and cuisine your heart desires).",

It is very \u02cbfunky\u00b4 with wonderful staff and it is run by the general manager Yohanes who is always on hand for a chat and ask you if everything is ok. As for the breakfast you just dream of it. Fabulous. The restaurant for dinner is fine dining, wonderful, wonderful food. We are going back there again this year. It is a great location near the beach (30 mtr). We can not wait to go back to heaven again to be with such wonderful people. Brid and Uli Stanke from Galway Ireland",

Also incredible music system with docking station and iPads with cool playlists for your use.

Location amazing you can walk less than 2mins to the beach (connected to double six beach). If you want go around somewhere else you should rent a scooter. \n\nSuggestions: female staff uniform with high boots heels is doesn't comfortable for them and very bad your their back because I reliase most of them standing, walking alot with this boots.

We initially booked for 2 nights but we decided to extend another night because we really liked it. A great modern theme has been applied which really resonated with me, and it made me feel at home. The staff are great and are very friendly. Breakfast is adequate and location is a small walk away from the busy seminyak streets (5-10 minutes). Definitely stay if you are looking for a modern themed hotel which seems quite hard to come by in South East Asia",

They are extremely friendly, informative and have done their homework.  The service feels very personal.  Well done. \n\nThe rooms don\u2019t really have numbers as such.  The hotel room system is set up like the streets on a monopoly board, which apart from being really creative, turns the hallways of what I usually think is the most boring part of any hotel, into something that is very \u201cinstagram worthy\u201d.  My room was on Mayfair blue.\n\nInside the room, with the champagne cocktail and chocolate just walking in is pretty wow, but when the staff start taking you through then you realise this is really something different.  Everything has a story, so better I just list to save time.  \n1. Loaded iPod with Bose speak\n2. Huge sofa the length of the room \n3.massive balcony \n4. Super comfortable bed\n5. Tv in bathtub\n6. Tv in main room\n7. Retro tv with own Bose headset in case you want to watch something different. \n8. Great amenities \n9. Kitchenette \n10. Coffee machine\nThe list goes on. \n\nFor the included breakfast, you choose from the al a carte menu, with the continental setup for you to take while you wait.  The menu for the breakfast is by far one of the most Creative I have seen in a hotel.  \n\nInside the hotel, 1 of the services that I did not get the chance to use was there in-house cinema.  They have 2 screenings a day and I\u2019m kicking myself I didn\u2019t do this because it looks like something special.  In the room service menu, I did notice something else I didn\u2019t use as well.  They call it in-flight dining, which is a premium dining experience they provide for you in the room.  I stayed midweek so the nightclub downstairs wasn\u2019t happening, but I have been there over a weekend and the best way to describe it is Lunar. \n\nAll in all this was an incredible stay, Super comfortable and amazing service.  Great job.",

A great respite from the craziness of Bali, but close to restaurants, shops and beaches of Seminyak.\nRoof top bar was beautiful at sunset and at night, and the cocktail and wine selection superb. Luna2 has restored my faith in luxurious Bali holidays without exorbitant prices!",

There's even a popcorn machine! \n\nWe looked at some of the guest rooms and they are stunning! Every detail has been considered and each room is unique. \n\nI had lunch here with friends and the food is the best I had while in Bali. I had the superfood salad which was fresh and filling. Be sure to try to house-made iced tea- it has cinnamon in it and it's so refreshing on a hot day! \n\nWe also saw the wine cellar and they have the biggest selection in Bali including champagne! \n\nI highly recommend this place! Even if it's just for lunch, dinner or a movie. ",

Each day we spent there it was as if each member of staff knew how to  cater exactly to our needs. Without a doubt the best food we've had since getting to Bali, the sublime breakfast was a cracking start to the day. Their cinema in the basement is a fabby addition to the hotel's facilities. The originality of Luna is what makes it so special - from the quirkiness of the room to the incredible attention to detail in both of the bars and even the pool. We cannot express how beautifully we were treated from the moment we were picked up. Thank you Luna and all of the team for the best stay ever. ",

We loved the Luna2; the design is wonderful; bright, airy and of course, funky.  The rooms were enormous with lots of really useful features: a dedicated area to charge phones and cameras, lots of space to put things down, a decent sized shower and comfy beds.  The pool was great - a decent size to swim proper lengths.  The location is perfect, next to the beach and a short walk to the delights of Seminyak.  The greatest attribute of the Luna2 is the staff; they could not have been more helpful.  They organised road trips, surfing, scooters - anything we wanted.  we had a ball and would recommend the Luna2 studiotel for the perfect family holiday. And I mustn't forget the yummy breakfasts and delicious cooking from Alanna and her team",

My big room, the friendly staff, the delicious food, the beautiful pool are all amazing and I've traveled a lot, this is definitely one of my new favorite spots. You're about a block away from the beach and far away enough from the noisy part of Seminyak. What I loved the most about this hotel is it's truly peaceful there. \n\nI want to mention that the hotel is, in my opinion, too far to walk into the center of town. I got rides every night. So if you're looking to be in the middle of all the action, this is not the location. \n\nThank you to the wonderful staff and the amazing chef, I will be back!:)",

It is nicely situated close to the beach but not too long of a walk from the shops. The rooms were amazing! food was the best we had in Bali! get the butterfish you will not regret it! Staff were very attentive and helpful of everything and anything we asked or requested. Pool is amazing! eating lunch by the pool was a high light! We were lucky enough to have the hotel to ourselves so it was even more magical! I recommend getting a in room massage. Roof top bar is amazing and cocktails are delicious! I cannot rave about this place more it is a must stay even for one night!",

From the incredibly indulgent cinema lounge with a popcorn machine and chairs that recline fully horizontally to the disco lounge on the basement with a pole for serious pole dancing. Imagine the fun my friends and I had spinning there. Sunset drinks were at the bar on the top floor with unobstructed views of the ocean and espresso martinis that could be a tad less sweet.  \nThe staff is lovely and well trained. The barman prepares possibly the best Bloody Mary's by the pool. The food menu at the restaurant is rich and varied. The wine selection is ample. We complained that the pizza was a bit too soggy because it had too much cheese and the chef came, apologised and took the pizzas back only to return with the most amazing crunchy pizzas. \nThe rooms have everything that you need in a good hotel. An iPod with a great selection of music from every era, a minibar that's more like a mini convenience store with eye drops for the jet lag and the hangover, deodorant and everything you need. \nI recommend this hotel to anyone looking for sheer unadulterated fun by the beach and in the heart of Seminyak.",

From the warm staff welcome with cold cocktail and towel right through to the good-bye things were top notch !  We were never bored, with various venues to have fun - the amazing sunsets on the roof top, evening fun in the private club Pop, and the great food in the cool and cozy restaurant !  The funky urban pool also a great place to chill during the day with push-button service. The huge rooms also great for a down time or to keep the party going. What an amazing place for groups of friends to meet up and catch-up.  The entire hotel is very social and we ended up having drinks with other guests who also seemed to be using Luna 2 as a global meeting place.\n\nLooking forward to our next launch !",

              "text": "Thank you yet again to the fabulous staff at Luna2 for making our return visit to this unique and totally fun boutique hotel, a another memorable occasion. We checked in with a group of friends for the weekend and we were met with big smiles, an ice cold fresh flannel and a refreshing cocktail. We all agreed it was like journeying to another world.  The rooms are a very generous, comfortable size and very well equipped.  The food is delicious and certainly the best for a hotel anyone had yet to experience. The staff are super friendly and very efficient. We moved around the hotel from top to bottom - that is from the restaurant to the roof top bar for sunset drinks (gorgeous view) and eventually  down to Pop, Luna2's private and very intimate basement nightclub. Then we enjoyed a day by the swimming pool, devouring those delicious Luna2 gourmet burgers and hot dogs, lots of rose wine and of course back up to the sunset lounge for cocktails.  Did I mention Luna2's private and very lush cinema?  What a perfect way to round off our weekend with Sunday lunch a movie, popcorn and one last cocktail before we get orbited back to earth.  It's official, Luna2 is one glorious world definitely worth discovering. They don't call it \"a space for jettingsetting lunatics\" for nothing! \ud83e\udd23",

There's a cool design edge to every element-monopoly references and quirky artwork. The studios are spacious and packed with all the essentials and more. We love Space -the rooftop bar with expansive ocean views for sunset drinks (2 for 1 cocktails-and great wine list). And if you're lucky enough to be around for the Sunday roast- do not miss it- you'll score perfectly cooked meats and roast vege with all the trimmings- (the clear influence of their top Australian chef). And breakfasts are a winner too- gorgeously presented and flavoursome. Staff are friendly and helpful- Definitely well worth it for a unique stay in Bali-",

              "text": "We booked their Sunset Suite back in July 2016 & paid in advance. There is only 1 such suite in the 14 room boutique hotel & it's the only one with view of ocean & sunset. They extended another guest's stay in that suite, so it wasn't available on our arrival--which was, of course, very upsetting. Citra Dewi, front desk manager, did everything possible to make up for this mistake: complimentary pick up & delivery, late check out on day of departure with no extra charge, set meal complimentary dinner on 1st evening, & reduced rate for entire stay. All of her amends were very gracious & appreciated. We stayed in a deluxe grand suite for 1st 3 nights--larger than the sunset suite & better lit bathroom BUT no view (just the narrow pool which is nice for swimming, but not much to look at.) Luna 2 has all the gadgets & amenities--many evenings they drove us to our dinner location. Sadly the projector in their small theater was broken; so, no movie watching. Aside from the guests in the Sunset Suite we were the only other hotel guests--rainy, low season?? We did have lots of sun; BUT the  beach which is about a100 meter walk: grossly disappointing--filthy dirty, dirty water in spots & a very big \"let down\". Wonderful, attentive service, but hard to really judge, since we were the only guests for several days. The d\u00e9cor is really different & totally unique.",

Unfortunately, sometimes unavoidable mistakes happen. In such rare cases, a satisfactory solution is always in place and preventable measures are introduced. I hope you find these actions satisfactory and up to your expectations. This is the least that we can do to address the unintentional inconveniences that we caused.\n\nWe are very pleased to hear that you enjoyed the design, as it is just one of the many features that distinguish us from other hotels and Balinese-style villas. I am particularly pleased that you found the service to be wonderful and attentive. December to March is having very challenging rainy season with wind and ocean currents pushing debris and litter to Kuta\u2019s shores, however we do our best to clean the beach on daily basis together with local community\n\nAgain, thank you very much for sharing your comment. We value your business and hope to retain you as guest for many years to come. \n\nKind regards\n\nCitra Dewi\nFront Office Manager",

              "text": "We stayed for a week at Luna2 and were blown away by the hotel and its wonderful staff. From start to finish we were taken care of with recommendations for things to do around Bali, great customer service, excellent western-style food, and a very well-designed property.\n\nThe location is within walking distance to Seminyak square, the Ku De Ta, Potato head, and a ton of bars/restaurants/shops. It is also right next to the beach, separated only by their private hotel. I will say that during December at least, the beach is not a reason to select this hotel (it is covered in trash) - but that is not Luna2's fault.\n\nThe hotel has a rooftop bar with beach views, a private cinema with daily showtimes, a bar downstairs next to the cinema, a pool, and a great restaurant serving primarily English food. It all has a very western/modern feel, so stay here with the understanding that it's not a 'traditional' hotel for Bali. That said, we enjoyed every moment of our stay and experienced plenty of Balinese culture outside of the property.\n\nI would absolutely recommend this hotel to friends and family.",

Our staff will be delighted to read your positive words relating to service and I will be sure to pass on your kinds words regarding the food to our Head Chef Alanna and her team\n\nYes, I am agree that we have a great location and we are always happy to know that our guests enjoy and take advantage of it, in Seminyak only a short distance from all the great restaurants, bars and beach clubs.  \n\nGarbage on the beach is submissions from the river that surround the coast. Trash washed up river during the rainy season which each end of the year and the beginning of the year. The conditions were very embarrassing for Bali. However our staffs and the local community each morning always clean up trash that washed up on the beach.\n\nIt is fantastic you got to experience all aspects of Luna2, including our award-winning wine list in Orbit restaurant, Pop! lounge bar, Lunaplex, cinema and The rooftop bar, Space champagne & caviar, which is a favourite spot for many of our guests, \n\nOn behalf of the entire Luna2 team, we would like to thank you again for recommending us and look forward to seeing you back at Luna2 in the near future. Thank you once again for your in depth review.\n\nKind regards\n\nCitra Dewi\nFront Office Manager\n",

Of all the 5 star hotels we've stayed in around the world, none can compare to the feeling of being amongst friends like it does here. Arif, the guys in the bar upstairs, the cleaning staff - all are happy to chat, share information and make you feel like you're part of a big family. Nothing was too much trouble, and we joked that the cleaning staff had us on surveillance as once we left the room for more than 2 minutes; we'd come back to a faultlessly clean room. \nThe food was exceptional, the drinks delicious in Space bar, all in all - just fantastic. \nWe can't wait to come back and enjoy this absolute gem.

Everything about Luna 2 is perfect, the staff spoiled us rotten and made us feel like family, the location is great, pretty much on the beach and close to all Seminyak has to offer. The rooms are massive and have great modernisms to enhance your comfort and I love the street art around the pool area and rooftop bar. The funky vides of this hotel resonate with you long after you leave. Will be staying here on my next trip without a second thought!",

Chef Alanna and Sidney are a credit to your team.\nThe service from all the staff was exceptional, I even received a delicious cocktail and Rubix cube chocolate on arrival after a long flight from London. \nThe cinema is a great addition, with regular showings of new films. Another highlight is that the hotel is within walking distance to the heart of stylish Seminyak and beachfront. \nOverall, a truly enjoyable stay and I highly recommend for work trips and family stays.",

From being picked up at the harbor, to being dropped off at our last stop, everything was fantastic. We had a studio room connected to a grand studio for the four of us and the rooms provided a huge space to unwind and interact with each other.  The kids loved the funky design of the rooms, particularly the bath with tv.  But the rooms are really just the start.  It is a cliche, but it is the people that contribute so much to the experience at the hotel (and it is an experience, rather than just a place to sleep).  We were able to experience a family meal in Orbit, a cocktail course on the rooftop bar, the kids had a cooking class in the private villa (wow, just wow), the cinema and the fabulous pool - all things made so much better by the Luna2 team.  I would not hesitate to come back here, and plan to do so soon.",

We enjoyed having you and your family with us, and I am glad the kids experienced every aspect of Luna2 \u2013 from the cinema to the pool and fun d\u00e9cor in the studios. The TV in the bathtub is one of my favourite items in the rooms too! \n \nWe look forward to welcoming you and your family back to Luna2 very soon.\n \nBest\n\nCitra Dewi\nFront Office Manager",

              "text": "The Luna2 is not a standard Hotel, even by Bali standards. \n\nFirst the design is amazing, and am really impressed they manage to maintain it flawlessly, despite the proximity of the ocean. If you have a chance, book the Mayfair3 room, that has a balcony on the ocean and a balcony on the pool, to enjoy spectacular sunsets from your bed... The rooftop bar is great also for starting your evening, and the Mondrian pool is just stunning.\n\nBut the most important about Luna2 is the spirit and the team. Those people make you feel even better than at home. The kindness of everyone, the real genuine caring are palpable in all interactions you have with the crew, and they will find any ways to make your stay a fantastic experience. It is also fantastic to see the same faces working there years over years, showing management dedication to local sustainability.\n\nAnd finally the restaurant food has greatly improved, it keeps a flavour of English food, but modern, lighter, more adapted to the bali usual weather. Thanks again to all the team, it was another fantastic stay !!!",

While they were processing our check in we were served tasty champagne cocktails accompanied by luna2 chocolate\u2013 thumbs up for the champagne cocktail, a very nice, refreshing surprise after our journey there.\n \nThe Grand studio we stayed in was really well equipped with all the gadgets you could possibly need and the staff gave us very knowledgeable  explanations of all the facilities. The studio is the perfect size with its quirky design and balcony overlooking the pool area. The entire hotel complex has a very intimate and private feel. We enjoyed the well stocked mini bar and all the additional essentials in the bathroom! \n \nWe were lucky as the weather was stunning so we decided to watch the sunset with a few cocktails on the roof top bar. As cocktail lover again I have to give a thumbs up for very creative, high quality cocktails \u2013 both taste and presentation were 5 star. Definitely a highlight for me. The unobstructed view of the sunset was also spectacular.\n\nWe took the recommendation to have the room service \u2018Inflight Dining\u2019 experience for dinner which was so well presented and all tasted delicious \u2013 that was fun.\n \nWe were really happy with our stay there, everything exceeded our expectations and we will definitely stay again.\n \nBig thanks to the awesome, attentive manager who made it all more special for us.\n \nBonus: Perfect location. Right on the beach and walking distance (if you actually wanted to leave the hotel) to all the hotspots like Kudeta.",

We are a family of 5 and the connecting suites were perfect for us. The Grand Studio came with a small kitchen/bar, an amazing circular lounge and a huge balcony - it connected to a smaller suite for the kids. We could easily hang out in the main suite.  Plenty of room.   \n\nThe design is truly inspired - the designer must be very creative. A wonderful funky vibe around space travel and Monopoly.  \n\nWe loved hanging out for sunset cocktails on the rooftop bar sipping sublime cocktails prepared by the amazing knowledgeable staff.  This experience was enhanced as our young kids were looked after by the hotel's wonderful nanny and other staff.  The kids were sitting in the huge soft chairs in the cinema room eating pop corn watching the daily children's movie. \n\nThey kids joined us for the superb food served in Luna2's own cozy yet funky restaurant. The food was very special prepared by international chefs. In the evenings we joined some friends in the night club downstairs.  They have a great range of wines and cocktails there. \n\nThe days were spent lying by the colourful pool sipping flat whites and the occasional cocktail.  \n\nWe ate outside a couple of times as Luna2 is only a 5 min drive to \"eat street\" with a great range of restaurants. It is also only a short beach walk to our favourite place - Ku De Ta. \n\nIf you like small hotels with a lot of thought given to design and guest experience in the cosmopolitan heart of Bali then this is the place for you. Highly recommend it.  We have been to Bali many times and will certainly be returning to Luna2 Studiotel. ",

The beautiful Seminyak beach is just half a minute walk from the hotel ! \nThe staff members are very warm and welcoming and are ever ready to help you. The amenities and services that the hotel provides are impeccable and so is the food ! \nI travelled with my family and it was worth every penny that I paid for.

Luna2 is by far the funkiest and \"un-Bali\" hotel around.  I stay regularly for business, and I like the fact that it is quiet, clean and with great staff.  The decoration in the rooms are certainly not done in the usual Balinese style, but they have everything that you need - A bit fridge stuffed with \"stuff\", coffee and tea making facilities, plus some hotplates if you want to cook something.  The food is always good and they have an extensive wine list.  A short walk to the beach you can turn left and wander down to Legian or turn right and head down to Seminyak proper.

Jess and Helmet from management are can do people who smile and just make your requests happen without any hesitation. \nLinda and Arif are also worth a special mention as we loved our daily chats with them at breakfast, but really the whole staff are great.\nThe rooftop cocktails of an evening are definitely worth trying as well.",

Only 14 rooms, you almost felt like you had the place to yourself. \n\nThe decor was amazing and the theme carried on throughout and was done so well.\n\nI found all the staff to be very friendly and very helpful. The manager was great at recommending great places to eat and was happy to book for us. \n\nThe rooms were very well equipped including a bunch of stuff you may have forgotten (which you could purchase for a fee) like mouthwash, panadol, toothbrush etc. \nThe shower Gel, shampoo and conditioner provided smelt really nice, but these were the only things provided, so none of the usual shower cap, sewing kit and things like that that you normally get.\nThe rooms were cleaned very well.\n\nThe pool area was nice although there were no views, just a courtyard type area. Great service round the pool at just a touch of a button which was a great.\n\nThe WIFI in our first room on level 1 was great, we were then moved to a room on the top floor due to an issue which was quickly sorted by management and the WIFI in that room was not so great as it just kept dropping out all the time, although round the pool area it was good.\n\nBreakfast was nice, a very small selection in the buffet and then a menu you could choose from. We also ate an evening meal in the hotel which was just beautiful and very tasty.\n\nThe actual location of this hotel was what has stopped me giving it 5 stars. It was not very easy to walk into Seminyak via the streets as they were very busy with cars and motorbikes and were very narrow with no pavements. You could however walk along the beach to get there (less than 10 minutes) and that was easy enough but we found the beach to be quite smelly and dirty which was a real shame.",

I agree unfortunately Seminyak Beach is one not one of Bali\u2019s most pristine white sand beaches.  It is one of busiest, since Seminyak is the island\u2019s most fashionable locations, and there are many popular restaurants and beach clubs along the oceanfront. And it is true that Bali\u2019s roads often leave much to be desired, so we suggest guests who prefer not to walk along our surrounding lanes to request a complimentary drop to the other areas of Seminyak, and our reception is also happy to arrange a taxi. \nWe are in fact in the process of providing a larger amount of amenities, thank you for this feedback as well.\nOverall it sounds like you did have an enjoyable stay with us and we hope to welcome you back.\nBest regards \nJessica Lee Cook\nFront Office Manager \n \n",

I will explain why at the end.\n\nThe staff are extremely helpful, friendly and conscientious, from the management through to the room cleaners. We couldn't fault them. They are very efficient and really keen to make sure you enjoy your stay.\n\nThe hotel itself is uniquely styled and we found the decor and furniture really fun. There was a really high attention to detail and the theme was carried throughout.\n\nThe rooms are well equipped with a kitchenette including a stocked SMEG retro refrigerator as the \"maxi-bar\" and everything else you could possibly need. There is a huge amount of storage, power points and seating. They have two or three TV's in each room and a good selection of channels including movie channels. The rooms all have views of the pool area and one or two rooms have a sea view although it is over roof tops as the hotel is not directly on the beachfront. There is a Nespresso coffee machine in each room which is complimentary and that was also a great touch.\n\nThe pool area carries on the theme and is a quiet refuge from busy Seminyak. Service is available around the pool at the press of a button which is a really cool feature.\n\nThey also provide complimentary membership to Canggu Beach Club which is a short drive away. This is partly because there is no gym on site. \n\nThe hotel was very helpful in making restaurant recommendations and bookings for us and also providing us with transport to and from the restaurant when we gave them notice. The transport service is based on availability though. We ate often at the hotel. Breakfast is a mix of \u00e0 la carte and a very small buffet selection. The quality was good although the menu was small. We had a really great dinner in the orbit restaurant one night but also had a couple of fairly average dinners from the all day room service menu.\n\nThe rooftop Space Bar is a cool spot for a cocktail and to watch the sun go down.\n\nThere is a cinema in the basement which we did not use but it certainly looked good and the movies that were scheduled twice daily were fairly up to date and would be a good way to spend a couple of hours with popcorn and cocktails.\n\nThe reason I found this hotel hard to rate and review is because it is a very small hotel (14 rooms) and it isn't the same as 95% of other hotels I have stayed at. It is fairly unique. So when you are thinking of booking, you need to consider whether things like having a gym on site is important to you. Or whether having a huge breakfast buffet selection is important. Or maybe you want to have a guaranteed sea view or a beach front pool. You can only walk to the shops via the beach (which we found not very clean or pleasant) or via the narrow side streets (where you might not feel very protected from traffic as there are no pavements).\n\nOverall I would rate the hotel as good rather than excellent at this price point. Mainly because of the location/ views. Although it is close\n\nFinally I want to thank Jessica for outstanding customer service. We had a bit of a problem with our first night and when that happens it can sometimes leave you with a negative feeling that is hard to get past. Sometimes things go wrong and when you travel frequently you have to accept that sometimes happens. The sign of good management though is when they recognise a mistake and respond appropriately as happened with Jessica on this occasion.\n\nI hope this review is helpful to future travellers.",

I am very pleased that despite your first night with us, on a whole your Luna2 stay was very enjoyable. I will be sure to pass your comments onto the entire team, as we do aim to deliver superstar service to each of our guests. The staff will be very pleased to know that we were able to exceed your expectations relating to high standard of service.\nRegarding your feedback on the all-day room service I am sorry to hear that at the time of your stay, our all-day dining and room service menu was not up to par.  We take this feedback very seriously, and have just recently changed this menu to make it a bit more comprehensive. We will certainly be monitoring all comments on the new menu, as well. Separately, I am pleased to hear your dinner in Orbit restaurant was great.\nAt Luna2 we pride ourselves with being a unique hotel in many aspects, and we do understand that while being small and ultra-modern, we are not for everyone when they visit Bali. However, we do like to provide a fresh alternative to anything else in Bali.  Thank you for your honest review in that matter, as I am sure it will help travellers who might be looking for a more traditional experience. \n\nKind regards \n\nJessica Lee Cook\nFront Office Manager ",

Luna 2 is funky and hip and if you are an Austin Powers fan ... you'll swear he'll show up \"Baby\"..  The gals who work there are in mini dresses and go go boots.  There is art depicting rubix cubes, large Monopoly hotels and houses and funk-a-delic art.  The pool and surrounding area is amazing.  This hotel features a 16 seat movie theater with two different movie showings every day.  You can even order dinner to eat while you watch.  Be sure and go to the Orbit Bar and do not miss trying one of their signature cocktails \"Houston, We Have a Problem\".  The rooms are just as funky and each has its signature motif.  The beach is a mere 30 second walk and the water was the perfect temperature to dive right in.  The food here is some of the most creative and delicious you will try in all of Bali.  Be sure to ask to meet Head Chef Alana.  Her culinary cuisine expertise will wow your palette.  Also see if you can try the new \"In-Flight\" meal in your room.  Wonderful and personable staff, close to the beach and a short taxi ride to shopping in Seminyak.  This is a quaint and fabulous hotel and you will be glad you chose the Luna 2.",

              "text": "After reading the reviews, I was convinced that staying in this hotel will be a good change from the usual Bali villas & resort that I stayed in before but I realized in few hours that it was not for me. \n\nPros: \nClean, modern & new feel to it. \nLoved the music played in the room. \nMartini served on arrival was great.\nCloseness to the beach\nService is good. It's what you get in a good hotel but we missed the personal touch we get from service crews in Bali villas \n\nIt felt like it's a good option for a work- business trip. However, I was there for holiday. \n\nCons:\nIt gives you a hotel feel vibe & forget that you are in Bali. It might be great for others, but not for me. \n\nBreakfast was ok not great. Maybe I had high expectation after reading the reviews. The food looked like it has been outside, displayed for a while.\n\nSwimming pool was un-inviting for me. But i liked the art wall. \n\nIt's a very quiet hotel. I only saw 1 couple during my 5 day stay. \n\nIt's a bit of a walk to everything else except the beach. So we had to use taxi to go mostly everywhere when it was raining or late at night.\n\nTaxis did not know this hotel. But I understand that it's because it's new. \n\nI was disappointed with the pillows quality & how few of them are available. With the price paid, I expected luxury sheets , pillows & covers. \n\nI stayed on first floor in a studio called bond on street. \n\nOverall, I think it's s good studiotel but not for me. I wish the reviews had more details which could've helped me with my decision. Also note that although close to the beach, if you want clean area to lie on the beach, you will need to go towards the neighboring resorts. Also when we walked to the beach, we saw the Luna hotel. Although we didn't go in that hotel, the swimming pool looked more interesting & less inclosed. \n \n\n",

We appreciate your pro\u2019s and I sincerely apologise you feel this way relating to your con\u2019s. We do understand that with the stark white and colourful interiors and pop art throughout Luna2 studiotel, the design is not what everyone looks for when they visit Bali. However, we are happy to provide a chic, ultra-modern and fun alternative for those who have been to the island before or are looking for a hotel with a more cosmopolitan feel.  We have noted your all of your points and will be discussing at our executive meeting on how we can rectify them. We are grateful for you to bring them to our attention, with items to improve on such as the breakfast, sheets, pillows etc. \nOnce again, thank you for your valuable feedback. Rest assured we do not take your con\u2019s lightly. \nAt Luna2 we are proud to say we are #1, and it is great regret that we failed to deliver on our aim to provide you with superstar service during your stay.  \n \nKind regards\nJessica Lee Cook \nFront Office Manager ",

Honestly, from the moment we were picked up from the airport (in a brand new mini-van, complete with a range of refreshments), I knew we were in for a treat! Although Luna2 is not what you would expect of Balinese accommodation, it is truly a phenomenal space. The interiors are a fun mish mash of mod, retro, and futurism, with lots of primary colour play. As there are only 14 rooms, you have a fair bit of space to yourself in your room, and you have a great view of the colourful pool from your own private balcony. With it's own cinema, a pool with pool toys, and an underground nightclub, Luna2 is perfect for adults and children (... and big children).\n\nA highlight for me was most definitely the gourmet dinner we had at their restaurant, Orbit. Hotel food has never been that darn good! We had a great choice of wine and cocktails, and the staff were super friendly!\n\nLuna2 is only about a 50m walk to the Seminyak beach front (their private hotel/villa is all that sits between the studiotel and the beach) and it is about a 5 minute drive to the Petitenget area.",

It is fantastic you got to experience all aspects of Luna2, from relaxing on your private balcony to enjoying a decadent degustation dinner Orbit restaurant. I will be sure to pass on your compliments to our culinary team for the dinner experience. \nWe hope you can come back to watch a movie in Lunaplex cinema or to have more drinks in Space, our rooftop bar. We look forward to welcoming you back in the near future.\nKind regards \n \nJessica lee cook\nFront Office Manager \n",

If you are a Star Trek fan, like the movie Barbarella, and enjoy pop art, then you'll feel right at home here. The staff immediately greeted me with a galactic themed cocktail and answered any questions I had. The rooms are large, comfortable, and the electronics are easy to use. Top floor has an outdoor bar and the bottom floor has a lounge/bar with a giant movie theater. My kind of place. It's a very unique spot in a good location with a professional staff. For those who like modern, stylish hotels.",

I am happy you were able to enjoy everything that we have to offer, from the outdoor lap pool, Lunaplex cinema, and being just steps away from Seminyak Beach.\n \nThank you again for your review, and we hope to see you back at Luna2 again soon. \n \nKind regards \n\nJessica Lee Cook\nFront Office Manager ",

I have to admit that they have one of the best rooftop to watch the sunset, furthermore they have the best quality cocktails of Seminyak. The staff is friendly and really well trained. The german manager is professional and welcoming.\nI have really enjoyed the private cinema located in the basement, it is so rare for an hotel to have its own cinema!!\nThe rooms are unique, i had the chance the visit some of them and they all have different atmosphere and decor.\nAlso, they are doing a Sunday roast which I strongly recommend. Really good food made by a real chef. \nAlways a pleasure to come and visit you at Luna2. \nKeep on providing quality to guest.\nAT",

To me she's always going to be Gary\n\nShe and Yoga are a credit to reception and should be very proud of the job they do\n\nAll the bar and restaurant staff are warm and friendly \n\nWe had the most amazing menu at dinner personally selected by the chef, it was stunning.\n\nHelmut & Jessica run an amazing establishment with the back up of an outstanding out of this world team\n\nIt's quirky, it's kitsch and for 5 days it was home and we were sorry to leave.\n\nReturning is not a question of if, but when - and I cannot wait !\n\nThank you so much to each of you and you made our holiday \n\nTil the next time - keep shooting the moon\n\nThis hotel is number 1 on TA for a reason and it's going to keep its crown for a very long time \n\n",

              "text": "My friends and I were looking for a place to chill out for our 25 year reunion, and we stayed at Luna2 villa and hands down, it was the best experience, especially in terms of service level among many other places that we have stayed in previously.  From the moment we stepped out of the plane at the airport, we were greeted by one of the staff to be taken to a car to be brought to the villa, it was top notch service until we left 3 days later.. The manager, Jessica, and the chef, Lana, greeted us upon our arrival and explained everything.  They were really friendly and made sure we were very well taken care of during our stay. The villa was spacious, the pool was amazing. it was beachfront and it's nice to wake up to the view of the beach.., and all the staff that waited on us were polite, friendly, and extremely accommodating.  It was everything that we needed for our reunion.  Breakfast was excellent. Everything comes down to details and Luna2 went far above and beyond our expectations. A few examples: we decided to go out clubbing on our second night and one of us didn't bring a pair of pants, and the manager managed to find a pair of pants for us in 5 minutes!!  We wanted to have something for breakfast that's not on the menu and the chef whipped it up for us.  Dinner reservations were made for us at one of the restaurants that we wanted to go to.  We have a superb and amazing weekend and we can't recommend this place enough and we would definitely come back!",

Rooms were fab, pool was fab and our visit too short...... The cocktails in the roof top bar were innovative and wonderfully presented and the sound of the waves from the beach ( 100yds if that) made it special. Highly recommended.",

At Luna2 we aim to deliver superstar service, and after reading your review, I am thrilled you felt that were treated like a superstar from the start, with pickup in our Lunamobile, and throughout your entire stay.\n\nI will be sure to share your feedback with chef Alanna Agnew about how much you enjoyed her personalised off-menu dinner. We take great pride in our wine list, as it has won awards from Wine Spectator, so I am glad you enjoyed the selection. The rooftop bar, Space champagne & caviar, is a favourite spot for many of our guests, so we hope to see you back for more cocktails and sunsets there. \n\nThank you again, and we look forward to welcoming you back to Luna2 very soon. \n\nKind regards\nJessica Lee Cook \nFront Office Manager\n",

We were looking for somewhere boutique that was a bit different and this was certainly the case with Luna 2, the decor was quirky but still had an air of luxury about it. I loved the smeg Union Jack fridge and the tv above the bath! I also liked that the room had glassware to use.  I have two distinct memories of our stay at this hotel and these were the personal service we received and the breakfast! ( thanks Linda for all the coffee!) I'm sure if we had dined at the hotel we would have been equally impressed. Sunsets on the rooftop bar were pretty nice too, and if you can, catch a movie in the cinema.  The location of Luna 2 was perfect for the beach being 200m away, and it was an easy walk to Ku De Ta. Seminyak square was a short walk along the streets. The only thing I could fault was that there were no luxury toiletries.\nThankYou to Helmut, Jessica and all the staff for making my husbands 40th celebrations memorable! We would love to come back and stay with the family next time.",

The design and style of the hotel is amazing and if you don\u2019t stay here you can still come for the Sunday roast, a lot of other hotels do Sunday brunch buffet however this Sunday offering is the best in Bali no doubt.\nThe service from front desk to the restaurant and space is flawless.\nStay here, you will love it and if you choose to stay elsewhere book for the best Sunday roast in Bali!",

This is a supercool stylish hotel and service is amazing, I really got friendly personal service and my observations is that everyone does. I would highly recommend if you are travelling as a couple or with friends - there is something for everyone. Great pool area and nothing is too much trouble for the team looking after you. I am also delighted that on Sunday's they now offer a traditional Sunday lunch. Now I know you shouldn't be wanting roast dinner whilst on holiday, but it is the perfect cure to too many cocktails the night before and this was certainly better than anything I've had in London recently! Chef Errol thank you - it's a shame you are not in London!! \nAlso not to be missed is seeing the sunset in space bar - my fav cocktail was Space Candy. \nThis hotel is the place to stay in Seminyak.

              "text": "Our family of three stayed for seven nights over New Years. We travel a lot and are regular visitors to Bali and know Seminyak well and decided to try the Luna2 Studiotel based on TA and other reviews and the uniqueness of the hotel. \n\nWe found the hotel to be very comfortable, quiet, responsive to guest needs and a very nice place to stay for our entire stay. \n\nI have dropped one star as; a) an issue arose upon arrival of our son not being allowed to attend NYE at the hotel despite email/s to the contrary prior to arrival which was disapointing & b) our arranged departure transfer using a hotel vehicle was either mixed up or given to another guest/s despite checking the day prior, & c) on our bill we were going to be charged for an arrival transfer (which we used) but also VIP Immigration Service (which we didn't and as regular travellers to the Island is a waste of time and money). To be fair to the hotel, all issues were resolved (we were told just after our son could attend NYE - although when the night came we felt we shouldn't attend the after dinner/fireworks drinks and we went elsewhere, a contractor was contacted and used as our departure transfer understandably at our cost & the bill anomaly was promptly corrected).\n\nThat said, we did enjoy our stay and previous positive reviews of the Studiotel we found to be very accurate. The rooms are very quiet, clean and well maintained with multiple cleans each day. The included wifi is excellent in terms of signal strength, consistency and quality.\n\nThe location is superb for beach access and about a 20 minute walk from Seminyak Square. The hotel kindly offered the use of a hotel car for quite a few of our dinner and other trip drop offs.\n\nThe restaurant (Orbit) is very good; serving three meals a day if required. Breakfast (included) is exceptional, our highlight being the raspberry yoghurt muesli and the ever changing breakfast canapes. The coffee is very good and made to order. Chef Errol prepared us a dinner one evening which was also very good.\n\nThe Hotel has an innovative and unique take on room service consistent with the design ethos of the hotel. To be fair we didn't use it a lot and while it perhaps lacks the variety of other larger hotels, for a small and intimate boutique hotel it was certainly adequate. An indonesian option (or a Luna2 fusion of an Indo option or two would have been nice though).\n\nThe pool is an excellent size and there's ample shaded spaces and spaces to stretch out and relax. The cinema is also worth a visit; again something unique and a nice place to spend a couple of hours with the family. Service (as one generally finds in Bali) is exceptional.\n\nOur small issues aside, we still recommend the Studiotel for a stay if you are coming to Bali and choose Seminyak as your destination. It's more than a small friendly boutique hotel that offers good levels of service and it's packaged and marketed smartly -something very unique for Bali.",

              "text": "Everything you need to know about the hotel BEFORE you come, are as what you've read in the other reviews.  Once you've read these reviews (including mine), cast your expectations and assumptions aside, and just book your stay with the studiotel.  Though personally, I rather you not book at all, cos I rather this be the best-kept secret of Seminyak!  :)\n\nWhat will bring me back to this studiotel and at the first available opportunity I might add?  The intimacy of the place and the personality of the people who run it.  Everyday they address you and your children by name, and make time to ask you about your day/last night/plans and offer suggestions.  Sure 14-rooms worth of guests ain't a lot of names to go through, but it's the time and effort they make to do so that matters.  \nEvery parent mentions Ayu in their reviews - I didn't actually engage her world-renowned services, and yet my kids like being around her whenever she's at the lobby!\n\nIf you want your holiday to be what a holiday should be - stress-free, relaxing, pampering - this is very much well-worth the money; and yet it's not exactly a very pricey property.  Speaking of pampering - I did ask for the two-way Luna Mobile.  Arriving on day 1, I truly feel pampered - cold towels and a cold drink or two!  However, it was a quiet ride to the airport on our last day.\n\nHow stress-free and relaxing?  Breakfast service is officially till 11am, and yet because we are always the last family for breakfast (we arrive no earlier than 10.30!), we never feel rushed to finish even though we're still eating 30mins past 11, and lunch service has to be prepared for.\n\nI must also mention one thing - the service I enjoyed during my stay actually began before I even packed for the trip.  Jessica in particular was already offering me recommendations of where to eat in and around the area.  More importantly for a person who craves connectivity - she helped me get a pre-paid data SIM card weeks before I arrived!\n\nA small suggestion - whilst I should have known better than to place my dirty laundry ON (instead of IN) the laundry basket, the housekeeping team assumed I needed laundry done.  To their credit, laundry service was prompt.  But perhaps, the studiotel should look into having guests drop the laundry chit (which is hung by the side of), into the basket if guests want laundry done. \n\nOn our last day, and with hours to burn after we've officially checked out, we took a dip in the pool.  We got served complimentary granitas - which was a very nice touch on a very muggy day.  More importantly, we were offered the use of a room for a short while to wash up before catching our evening flight home!\n\nAny complaints about this place?  Yes, I do have a big one - I like my popcorn sweet, not salty.  :)\n\nBeyond the studiotel though, and if you're a newbie to Seminyak, be aware that if you're bringing young children here, the beach isn't as pretty or as mild or even as clean as those along say Nusa Dua.  It can be intimidating even - it's the Indian Ocean after all.  But the sunsets here are truly breathtaking.  \nIf you're looking to head up north towards Seminyak Square (for great food options and shopping - Jessica has great recommendations) or far down south towards Kuta just because), the beach however is a great place to walk along to get to either locations, as opposed to the narrow alleys and roads, where you'll be flirting with Bali's notorious traffic conditions.",

This smallish hotel punches above its weight. At the time we stayed it had excellent management in place. It has a small rooftop bar. Try to secure a suite on the top floor, or at the minimum a suite and you shouldn't be disappointed. Personally we wouldn't stay in Seminyak again as there are far more beautiful beaches and places to visit in Bali than there are Seminyak. Although, having said that Seminyak does have some decent restaurants and bars. We found the beach disappointing however. It's big sure, but not that great and there are lot of hustlers who operate the beach sun bed system, which rather spoils it. They are however unrepresentative of Bali people, who we found genuinely friendly & helpful. We stayed 4 days, which really was probably a day too long in Seminyak for us. However, take advantage of the Luna2 complimentary entry to the beach club near Uluwatu. It's  exceptional, and they had reserved sun beds for us. You journey to the beach down a travelator  Lastly, when arriving at the airport ensure that your driver knows exactly where he's going, as ours first tried to drop us off at some dive down an alley. Give your driver the address as well as well as the name of the hotel as there are a couple of other places in Seminyak with similarly named hotels. When you arrive outside the Luna2 Studiotel you may think, oh dear, we're going to be disappointed. But we doubt you will be as the place wins you over. It's worth staying a couple/ few days, but certainly we wouldn't stay longer simply because the hotel was in Seminyak.",

It does not detract from the main values: good rooms, good staff, good restaurant, great beach side location. \nJessica Lee, the front office manager is an absolute gold mine of good ideas and help--talk to her.\nThe pool is surprisingly large for a smaller hotel, big enough for sensible lap swimming, so bring your goggles (you likely can't buy them in Seminyak: well, we couldn't).\nThe roof top bar is recommended--friendly staff, signature cocktails (Smoked Negroni is an experience as well as a cocktail). One night at least, however, walk along to the Moonlite bar as well. Both are great places to have drinks and see the sun set.\nIts an easy taxi ride into town: ask Jessica for recommendations. if you like funky, try the Republik45 ...\nWe stayed in the room  \"Piccadilly on Ground\" (the hotel has a MONOPOLY sub theme!)--a  great room with access to the pool etc. BUT, there is a private cinema below and we found the noise too much in the end. They gave us another room without any hassle (example of the good service).",

              "text": "I am very pleased to say that Luna2 Studiotel lives up to its high ratings. We were travelling with our two sons (11 and 15) and while we had previously visited Bali, they hadn't. This chic boutique hotel with only 14 rooms was the final leg of our stay.\n\nWe were there for just 2 nights for the Seminyak experience after 3 nights in Jimbaran and 5 nights in the sleepy traditional fishing/diving village of Amed. \n\nThe hotel is visually brilliant with its combination of Mondrian-Monopoly-Warhol-Lichtenstein touches. 10 out of 10 for service, friendliness and food. It's just a few metres walk to the beach, although even though Bali has its new \"clean and green\" policy going, the city beaches still can't compete with the Aussie ones, although there is a whole lot of action down there and the kids loved it.\n \nThe rooms are very quirky and well set up. The only comment is that I thought creating a mini-bar situation to buy toothpaste, mouth wash etc was a bit of a stretch considering the price of the rooms. My son couldn't find his toothpaste and had to buy a $3 tube. Since we were a family of 4, we had to have two rooms. We took the Sunset Suite, but we decided that we also really liked the kids' room which was the standard suite.\n\nFinally, the downstairs private theatre. After a week in the water in Amed with virtually no technology, we were happy for the boys to indulge in a movie and play a bit of X-Box on the big screen with super-comfy recliner chairs and service from DeeDee - the cherry on our Bali cake. \n\nI wanted have a few different Bali experiences with my family and the Luna2 Studiotel is about as far from traditional Bali as you can get. It was the perfect finish to our trip. Jessica was also incredibly helpful and in-the-know, she was able to point us towards some fabulous restaurants - including Republik 1945 - which we all loved.",

The staff were very attentive and friendly, nothing was too much trouble.\n\nWe were so impressed that we could spend the whole day by the pool and see no other guests, we felt like it was our own private resort. I loved the fact that it was peaceful and quiet.\n\nFantastic place to stay, I recommend it to any frequent Travellers, especially those looking for something different.\n\nWe will definitely be back to this gem of Bali.",

Navigation was a bit tough (it is in main Seminyak and very close to 4 Seasons, for future travellers) and the main entrance actually looks a bit like a side entrance, but upon entering, we were in for several consecutive surprises. The welcome drink was an excellent cocktail, the initial \"meet and greet\" was very nice and homely and we actually got to watch a movie \"gold class\" while the babysitter took care of our little dude (Ayu is the best babysitter we have ever met, period!). First time I had a fantastic Bloody Mary while watching a movie in a cinema hall:):). \n\nA paragraph about the food. We've had breakfast spread in quite a few hotels.This was probably the best and most delicious my wife and I have ever eaten till date (yes actually that good)! Their fish \"main course\" was the best fish i have ever had and my only request is for Luna2 Studiotel to add some dishes as choices in \"a la carte\" are too few. \n\nTo top it all up, the walk from the hotel to the market is wonderfully haunted and quite safe. My wife and i had a great time walking at 12am in semi dark alleys:):). \n\nBeds was incredibly comfortable to the point where we simply didn't want to get up in the morning. Most comfortable pillows we've ever slept on and if we had larger bags would've carried at least one with us without any shame..:) \n\nWifi was quite good.\n\nThe staff is excellent and very well trained and our sendoff was again very personal and homely. Definitely recommending for a visit to one and all, please try Luna2 Studiotel and you will not be disappointed.",

Great food, also during breakfast. Loved the design pool and due to the small scale of the hotel you have the pool often to yourself.\nService is VERY personal. This is the way this lovely hotel distincts itself from the other Seminyak properties.\nI was there with my almost 70 year old parents who were afraid that they would be to old for such a funky place, but they they did not feel out of place at all due to the very nice and accommodating staff. Will definitely come again.",

I think nearly every member of staff eventually introduced themselves to us over our five day stay.  The bright d\u00e9cor is well thought out with hints at space travel and the game of Monopoly in the public areas. The large bedrooms were beautifully furnished and thought had been given to the contents of the fridge and spare toiletries that we may have been forgotten.  The cooked breakfasts were wonderful and the options of vegetable or fruit drinks meant we could pretend we were being healthy some days.  We loved the small cinema in the basement with our drinks and popcorn and cocktails on the roof watching sunset. We also enjoyed a five course degustation menu on the roof where thought was given to fun presentation and great flavours.  The small pool area was a quiet place to flop in between visits to various bars, restaurants and shopping. A lovely break.",

It is absolutely flawless.. \n\nThe decor is different than any other hotel, very quirky and cool! The staff were friendly and attentive when you needed them. Very thoughtful down to the last detail, getting us a coffee to go when we were heading out and missing breakfast or a cold bottle of water to take on a shopping trip in the afternoon. We arrived to a cocktail and chocolates and a cold face cloth, and they would bring out cold face cloths mid day every day if you are sat by the pool. Relaxing poolside could not be simpler, you have to press a button and one of the amazing staff can bring you cocktails, lunch, whatever you need. \n\nBreakfast is exceptional, including breakfast canap\u00e9s, fresh fruit, juices, pancakes, coffee - perfect! \n\nWe even tried the \"in flight\" dining one night where we had room service which is wheeled into the room in a space age silver cabinet and presented on trays, very different and beautiful food as always. \n\nThe room was equipped with everything we could need, a small Smeg fridge with lots of drinks & snacks and a bathroom 'mini bar' with anything you might have forgotten. Huge shower and a bath with a TV above for relaxing. The rooms are cleaned twice a day. \n\nWe had cocktails at Space a few times, and watched the sunset over the water. Once again just PERFECT, relaxed vibe. When we got back to our room one night we had some chilled music playing on the iPod dock, lights set to the mood & a water jug and glasses set out for our return. They honestly think of everything. We were so sad to leave and will definitely be back! \n\nI can't see anyone being disappointed with Luna2! ",

              "text": "Very cool pop art vibe. Modern esthetic. Visited shortly after a volcanic eruption, and as a result the hotel was empty. We saw only one other couple during our stay. The staff were very eager to give us all the attention and service they could, since we were essentially the only ones to look after. I do believe that even if the hotel were fully booked, the service and personal attention would have been exactly the same. From giving great advice and suggestions about local shops and restaurants, to helping us plan day trips and surf spots, the staff went above and beyond our expectations.",

We were in residence there for 3 fab weeks, and our family joined us for a week for a post wedding celebration. We took over their amazing villa and the hotel for that week. It worked a treat and everyone loved it. Perfect location, beautifully designed and super fun.\nThe staff are all wonderful in every way, always very welcoming and never not sporting a happy face. Nothing was ever too much trouble. Guest\u202a+61\u00a0415\u00a0681\u00a0013\u202c relations crew, Jessica and Helmet , were fantastic.  The chef is fab, breakfasts were delicious and the food in general was great.\nWe enjoyed watching a movie on a couple of occasions in the private cinema and we had a super fun night in private club downstairs.\nTheir attention to detail is very impressive. In all the time we were there we could not pinpoint a single flaw.\nThe roof top bar is a super spot to enjoy a cocktail (they make very good ones!) to catch a sunset, and the restaurant is a choice spot to enjoy lunch or dinner no matter if you are not staying at the hotel.\nWe have and will continue to recommend this wonderful hub to anyone and everyone.\nThank you, guys, for a truly memorable stay. See you back there soon!\n",

Aiming to deliver superstar service to all our guests is our main goal, and it is great to read we achieved that for your entire stay! \r\nOrbit restaurant is indeed a \u201cchoice spot\u201d to have dinner or lunch, with Errol Defoe heading an incredible culinary team. His Lunafood really is next level, and I am also very happy to hear you enjoyed a few cocktails in Space champagne & caviar as well.  \r\n\r\nThe entire team is grateful for your very kind review and we look forward to seeing you and your husband back very soon for another visit to Luna2, and a fun night in Pop! lounge bar.\r\n \r\nKind regards\r\n \r\nJessica Lee Cook \r\nFront Office Manager",

For a small hotel they have thought of everything, they even have a club and a cinema. My kind of place.",

              "text": "This is the only place you need to stay in Seminyak if you want an Oasis free from the chaos.  \n\nHow about the style of the place?  As the brochure says it's the vision of the future as seen from the 60's.  Think The Jetsons, the golden era of 1st class flying, Carnaby street, a little Austin Powers and a big dose of Andy Warhol pop art!  You can find plenty of clubs in Bali, plenty of uber luxurious hotels etc, but you won't find any place cooler than this hotel... it's just fun to be in and I've already decided the next house I build is going to have a Mondrian finish in the pool. Awesome! ;-)\nHow about the food?  So so good... 1st class chefs, cooking food as good as any hotel and better than many restaurants (Balinese and Western).\n\nThe cocktails?  Spot on, super tasty, creative... worth the price tag!\n\nGuest services?  Could not be more attentive, from the in house Nanny Ayu (who is the first person my wife has ever trusted with our 18m old son, she was amazing), the hookups for dining, tours etc, the friendly genuine conversation and interest in our comfort and well being every day from each and every staff member... it's truly spot on!  I honestly wish I was able to thank each of you personally on our checkout.\n\nIt's a boutique hotel ok, there's only 14 rooms so there's on gym, no onsite spa etc etc but it's got a great pool, brilliant rooms, great food and drink and a couple of funky onsite bars that are both great!  So... if you plan to get out and about whilst in Bali... you'll be so happy come home to Luna2 each night!",

What better way to remember your memories with your 18-month old son on holidays then re-creating the pool from Luna2!  You must send us pictures when the time comes. \r\n\r\nWhile we do not have a gym, we do have sports instructors who come on-site for training and we offer complimentary access to Canggu club, which has a gym and tennis courts.

              "text": "We chose Bali for our daughters wedding in June.  The location was very convenient for our guests who came from Australia, Hong Kong and London where our daughter has lived.  All 14 Studios were filled with some of the guests and it was a hectic fun and busy week.  ALL the staff are simply amazing, from pick up at the airport, reception,  beautiful cocktail on arrival, unpacking all our luggage and simply handling everyones requests no matter what!   It is hard to compare with any other 5 star hotel or so called boutique hotels, it is unique in every way.  The quality of produce which is sourced daily and the executive chefs supervising a large staff to ensure that every guests food experience is fabulous.  The eating options are various from a beautiful cool funky restaurant, pool side dining and roof top terrace where sunset drinks are an absolute must!  The design and layout of the whole property makes you feel like your the only guests there.  There is a basement nightclub called POP which is staffed by a very competent mixologist and the music is Euro standard.  In case you want a quiet night you can laze in a 16 seat come lounge chair/bed and watch the latest of every movie on a theatre sized screen munching on burgers, hot dogs and popcorn and any required beverage.   Highly recommended ",

I think we had a reply within the hour (possibly less) about changing our booking - this was 5* as far as I am concerned given the confusion over flights etc.",

We did not realise this meant a custom made breakfast, with juice, unlimited coffee, sweets, fruit etc. Much better than any buffet!\n\nThe hotel is positioned down a laneway maybe 50m back from the beach. Some of the key highlights for us were.\n\n\u2022\tJess was an amazing hostess (hostess with the mostest!), always checking to see how we found our stay. Asking what we were doing and suggesting places for us to eat and drink. Our preference is good quality and well priced food  - Jess worked this out pretty quickly and directed us to some great places.\n\u2022\tHelmut knows his stuff when it comes to drinks and places to visit. Legend!\n\u2022\tThe retro design of the hotel is pretty cool and unique, it makes Luna life interesting!\n\u2022\tDrinks on the rooftop at sunset cannot be missed! We did this a couple of times.\n\u2022\tArif (staff member) looked after me when I was sick (manflu!), with complimentary ginger tea with honey and Berocca. I am very grateful for the support!\n\u2022\tRooms are very spacious and the bed was incredibly comfortable \u2013 there\u2019s even a pillow menu.\n\u2022\tThe pool is the perfect size for a smaller hotel, always kept clean, they even come around and clean your sunglasses while you relax!\n\nImprovements\n-\tReally, really hard to critique here! Can\u2019t say we can think of any at all.\n\nThis is THE place to stay in Seminyak, do it.\n\nWe will be back again soon, without a doubt!\n\nMatt & Kirsty",

They were so friendly and always made you feel special particularly Jessica, the front office manager, she was so helpful and up to date with the new restaurants and places to go. The Daily breakfast was delicious and again made more enjoyable by the helpful staff. The Cinema was a pleasant surprise. A very comfortable 16 seat cinema for guests Just like your own Gold Class Cinema. They have thought of everything to make the guests welcome. Looking forward to our next Luna2 experience.",

From the staff outfits, to the menu design, the concept comes to life with an amazing atmosphere and friendly & attentive service. I always visit the rooftop and choose this place for stay cations in Bali. As an expat from NYC, I find Luna2 to be the one of the few places on the island with cocktails, food, and service on par with the places I used to visit in NY. The rooms are beautiful and modern and stunningly designed and the food and cocktails are delicious, complex and thought out. This is my favourite destination in Seminyak and highly recommended for those seeking something a little chicer in Bali",

And I really liked the in flight dining menu as well as being able to order a la carte to the menu. Make sure u take a night off the tiles to enjoy the lunaplex private cinema as well! Overall the excellent service an attention to detail makes luna2 luxurious holiday treat. Thanks guys!",

We had two in the room above us who seemed to run up and down from very early in the morning. Also the atmosphere by the pool was somewhat shattered by the cries of small children.",

The pool area was quiet and relaxing with staff always ensuring that I was happy and promptly bringing food & drinks when ordered to my bed at the pools edge. All dishes I had the pleasure of trying whilst at Luna 2 were beautifully presented, rich in taste & flavor & cooked to perfection. Lastly but certainly not least, the staff at Luna 2 are in a league of their own. The entire team were so accommodating and truly a pleasure to deal with! Special mentions to Jessica, the office manager & Helmut & Errol who made me feel so welcome and comfortable the entire time that I was there. I can not wait to return to Luna 2 in the near future.

But then I experienced Luna 2 Studiotel and was blown away.  It is by far the coolest place in Bali from the roof top bar to the funkiest night club but more importantly, it does all the other stuff so well; the service is nothing short of amazing, with a dedicated and quite glamorous team who treat every guest with such care and attention you won't want to leave.   The design ethos is so different for Bali but still feels authentic and luxurious.  Created by design guru Melanie Hall, I noticed a different and wonderful detail every day.  It is bright and bold with a strong modernist ethos, but also extremely comfortable and luxurious.  The rooms are nothing short of stunning with huge mini bars (maxi bars) and the most comfortable beds.  They are so well designed and interesting, it's hard to leave in the morning, but then you remember the delicious poached egg and avocado on rye and a glass of champagne waiting for you at breakfast.  I couldn't recommend it more highly.",

From the wonderful decor to the amazing food and drinks this place has it all, and that's saying something for one of the only hotels on the beach with it's private section of beach.  Watching the sunset from the rooftop bar which offers a mouthwatering list of refreshments that include Oysters, Caviar and champagne martinis.  This place was one of if not the best hotels I have ever stayed in.\n\nI have to add that the staff went a long way towards making that a reality.  Kind, understanding, helpful, considerate, generous, it's hard to go on and not sound like a broken record with corporate sponsorship, but it is true.  This is both affordable and enjoyable, cool and classy, comfortable and stylish.\n\nThe food was amazing, breakfast every morning was a highlight of the day.  It's been a long time since I had had an English fry up that good. Strolling along the beach was incredibly relaxing and so easy as I mentioned its a stones throw...\n\nJessica and Helmut, thank you so much, you guys made it really special.  We have stayed in our share of bouquet and five star hotels but that trip takes the cake.  Thank you again for making ti so wonderful.\n\nWe hope to see you again,\n\nI look forward to bringing a group of friends and staying at the private hotel.  While it would be hard as the Studiotel is still so good.  How can you pass up a private sunset with not Air Asia umbrellas in Sieminyak.",

The attention to detail in terms of design and service are unrivalled.\n\nThe staff were friendly, professional and attentive. They went the extra mile in making recommendations of places to go, organising all bookings/ transport and showing us around the hotel. My bag was even unpacked for me! The decor is modern, funky and sharp. Luna2 has it's own cinema and roof top bar.  The room had a great music playlist, plenty of space and a very well designed bathroom. The house-baked pastries and a swim in the beautiful pool were a great way to start off the day.\n\nThe location is perfect - the best in Seminyak. You are right on the beach and near to many great shops, restaurants and bars - not that you'll ever want to leave!",

We lucked out and had great experiences in ALL of our stays. BUT, our time at Luna2 was above-and-beyond. Jessica was super helpful to us in our visits and recommendations and so friendly in showing us around the property.\n\nThe feeling of relaxing you get when you walk into your room at the Luna2 is exactly what you hope for. Music playing lightly, beautiful rooms, thoughtful furniture and super spacious. I took extra showers because of how awesome the shower was! And the breakfast was awesome. The staff was super friendly at all times of the day.\n\nThere was nothing they could have done to make it any better and we can't recommend it enough!",

              "text": "After driving through a super narrow road, there it was- the Luna2! We were greeted lovely by numerous staff with babysitter Ayu introducing herself as the babysitter and being part of the service so we could have dinners just the 2 of us! She was absolutely brilliant and we surely used her a lot. This hotel only has 14 rooms plus the adjacent villa but a lovely playroom ( unlike the W which has 100s of rooms and no area for children...) this room could be a little better lit but apart from this little remark, this hotel could not be better, funkier and the service could not be better. Decor everywhere is superb and unique, rooms are spacious and clean with a maxibar instead of a minibar( meaning a Smeg frige filled with proper sizes bottles and a wide selection) and we had a private cinema viewing in their own little cinema which could not be better either: funky design, comfortable rocking sofas that can be extended to be bed like. Popcorn from a retro popcorn machine, cuddly blankets. \nFood was amazing too! For breakfast there is a lovely selection on the buffet plus an a la carte choice, fresh juices and coffee. \nLike everywhere in Bali, hotels do not have private beaches, the beach which is 2 walking minutes away, has dark shimmering sand and is clean, nice busy but rough- which is good I suppose when you're a surfer:)\n\nAll staff was amazing, helpful, friendly, switched on, quick and efficient. Nothing more to say- we had a perfect stay here and would go back without question. ",

Helmut even pretty much planned a whole day of sightseeing for us with personal recommendations of his favourite places to go to and Jess offered complimentary late check out on our last day which was great as our flight was in the evening. \n\nThe Studiotel is relatively new and has so many fun design features, everywhere you look there is something fun and surprising. There was also an iPod with music in the bedroom with playlists for different times of the day like 'breakfast', 'brunch', 'mid afternoon' and 'party' which we enjoyed!\n\nLuna2 is located at the end of a narrow winding road right near the beach, we found some taxi drivers had difficulty finding it so we showed them the location on a map rather than the address. There is a \"Luna 2 Navigator\" which has a map of the Studiotel which you can show them. \n\nLuna2 is within a 5 minute walk of the beach and Ku De Ta, and within a 10 minute taxi ride of places such as the W Hotel, Potato Head, Bambu & La Lucciola so it is a great base for exploring Seminyak.\n\nWe would recommend this place if you're looking for something different from the usual Bali villa style accommodation and a more intimate hotel experience. Big thumbs up!!!\n",

The d\u00e9cor is unreal encapsulates elements of a Monopoly board, as well as retro glamour and chic throughout the hotel. The rooms are very generous in size and smell amazing! The breakfast was one of the best we've ever had, including fresh juices as well as classic and gourmet fare. The location was beach front and close to all the activities in Seminyak, so you can walk along the beach to any point or just catch a quick taxi. We've been to Bali many times and this was by far our favourite hotel!",

              "text": "So many people have given you what you need to know about the quirky / retro design features of this hotel that I can't really add anything - so instead I'm going to focus entirely on the staff because they are the magic ingredient that takes this building from simply being bricks and mortar to being a vibrant, personable, engaging, stimulating and fun place to stay! Helmut our Austrian host is an absolute star - striking a balance between getting to know you and giving you the space and local knowledge you want to indulge yourself in the many wonderful experiences a place like Seminyak has to offer. Throw in the fact that he's an award winning mixologist and you have yourself a first rate host who can make a massive contribution to you holiday experience. He referred us to El Kabron and got us seats in the VIP section to indulge in cocktails whilst watching a stunning sunset. He referred us to Republik 45 - the best Indonesian food and all round dining experience you could hope to find here. And more importantly for us celebrating our wedding anniversary he arranged for us to eat dinner at the hotels private villa next door facing the beach under the direction of Errol the Head Chef.\n\nAnd that brings me to the food at the hotel - Errol, originally from London, has worked under Gordon and Raymond - two of the most easily recognisable Chefs out there today. In doing so he has clearly mastered a range of cooking styles - but more importantly he's a very down the earth and likeable guy who takes the time to get to know you a bit so that he can give you the sort of dining experience that will rock your world. At our private dinner he made so many different flavour combinations come to life, introducing little twists with the presentation, explaining a little bit about the techniques used  and even where the food is sourced from. As a double act he and Helmut are formidable and you get a sense that they enjoy working with one another - pushing each other to outdo themselves time and again.\n\nThen there's front of house where we met Jess, a really genuine Aussie girl, who makes life so much easier for you during your stay - she has clearly made it her business to get to know the local area and can hook you up with any number of places to go sight seeing or for food / shopping etc. Jess is one of those people, who end up feeling like you've known for ages after only just meeting her. She treats you the way she would expect and like to be treated at a hotel of this stature and you can't really ask for anything else.\n\nAs for the rest of the staff - from the security guys on the door or at the beach corner, to the waiting staff in the restaurant and bar, to the cleaning and maintenance staff - all are so friendly and so helpful that you can't help but think about the training they have received and how well they have bought into the philosophy of excellence that this small hotel aspires to embody. At the end of the day it's a cool boutique hotel but what makes it seem like it's come from nowhere to stand toe to toe with other local more established heavyweights are its amazing staff. They gave us the best holiday experience both inside and outside of the hotel that we've ever had, and whilst we are sad to be leaving we will do whatever we can to ensure that others give them the chance to show how good they can be! A huge and very sincere thanks to all the staff at Luna2 - you guys rock!",

Every room was nicely designed by their British designer owner. I love how it is simply different than other hotels and villas in Bali. The interior design are absolutely colorful. I love how everything seems so personalize and private. With limit amount of rooms, they make sure to bring high quality service to you. LunaPlex private movie theater and Space bar were my favorite. If you just wanted to stay in for a lazy day, there are plenty options for you to enjoy your time. \nHowever there are few things that you should know before checking in. If you are someone who really cares about breakfast sanctification. This hotel is not buffet style. They do offer delicious food. However breakfast options are really minimal. Breakfast is continental style. Free Breakfast will not fill you up, but there are a list of options you could choose from for additional charge with reasonable price. Another thing that you should be aware, this hotel is new and not a lot of people know about it yet ! So I had taxi drivers having problem sending me to the right location even with the address in hand. It is right next to the beach so it is a bit far away from where all thing local shops are. \nOverall being 10 the highest I would give this hotel a 8.5. I really enjoyed by stay, every corner there's going to be some thing that surprise you. It was just such a FUN FUN stay !",

Melanie Hall, Luna2 founder & designer will be pleased to read your comments on the design. I will be sure to pass on your words to the staff regarding our delivery of high service. It sounds as though you got to experience all that Luna2 has to offer, and you are right in saying that for anyone wanting a relaxing lazy day without having to leave the hotel, we have it covered with watching a film in Lunaplex cinema and having a cocktail in Space roof top bar while watching the sunset. \r\n\r\nWe appreciate your feedback our breakfast offering, as you mentioned because we have only fourteen rooms we do not have a traditional large buffet on offer. However, with nearly all of our bookings, guests that have breakfast included \u2013 from the extensive range of bite size options on the buffet, to the a la carte meals from the Orbit breakfast menu, which can be anything from corn fritters, pancakes, full English breakfast or any style of eggs. I do apologise if this was not clear to you, but nearly all of our guests enjoy daily complimentary breakfast, complete with coffee and tea. \r\n\r\nAt Luna2 we understand some taxi drivers may be confused with our location, and we do our best to provide the location via GoogleMaps, as well as directions from the airport on our website. We will be sure to make this more clear to future guests. We also provide maps that identify our location and all of the shops and restaurants that are within close proximity in the heart of Seminyak. \r\n\r\nThank you for staying with us, and for taking the time to write a review. \r\n\r\nWe hope to see you back at Luna2 for another cosmic stay. \r\n\r\nJessica Lee Cook\r\nFront Office Manager",

With a small kitchenette, Nespresso coffee maker and laundry service, they are suited for even a longer stay. The staff was very friendly and attended to all our needs.\n\nA couple of times we also had a quick lunch in Orbit restaurant at the hotel, which serves high quality western style food that can also be delivered by the pool or your room. For a more local dining experience there is plenty of options within a short taxi drive or walk through the (rather narrow) streets of Seminyak.\n\nUnlike the neighboring Luna2 private hotel, studiotel is not directly at the beach, but just a 50 meters of pedestrian way away.\n\nThe lovely pool was directly accessible from our studio and provides a peaceful environment for relaxation with shaded sunbeds with food and drinks only a button press away.\n\nThis is a beautiful hotel, but don't take my word for it \u2013 just stay here once and soon you will be waiting for your next visit!",

The staffs were nice and helpful. Since I came in December 2014, I don't really know how it is now. I wish you all the best luna2.",

The staff were warm, welcoming and pleasant. The room was large and fully equipped with modern day amenities, iPod, Satellite TV, mini bar, Kitchenette and iPad. Our room was on the first floor giving us easy access to the lap pool. My boyfriend and I planned to explore the night life but the bed was so comfortable it sucked us in. We had really good sleep! We wanted to hit the gym and so we decided to give a try to Canggu Club. Luna2 gave us two platinum cards and to go coffee for Canggu Club. It was VIP treatment. Luna2 Studiotel has a roof top bar overlooking Seminyak beach. The cocktails here are top notch. We ordered two old fashioned cocktails and enjoyed a magnificent sunset. Complimentary breakfast was delicious and filling. Compliments to the chef. We had a fabulous time here.",

              "text": "I cant begin to say how amazing this hotel was. My wife and I stayed in Luna 2 for the final two nights of our honeymoon about two weeks ago. We arrived pretty early (11am) and straight away we were made feel genuinely welcome by Jess and the guys on reception and even the chef Erol. Despite us arriving early, by the time we had our welcoming cocktails (which were amazing ) drank, our room was ready. \n\nWe saw some of the photos before hand but they do not do the place justice.  The multiple TV's, popart, huge selection of drinks in the SMEG fridge....IPAD, TV in the bath, cinema downstairs with lazyboy chairs...the list just goes on and on and i could write about ten paragraphs about the decor and the cool quirky stuff because it is all amazing,  but just check out the photos. The thing that really makes this place stand out is the service.\n\nWe have been to many hotels over the years, some a lot more expensive than this and supposedly better ...But none of them come close to the service here. Several other reviews have said this, and its true...nothing is too much trouble. The staff chat away with you and are always making sure that you are looked after and ok without being intrusive. \n\nOn our first night, we said we would have dinner in the hotel restaurant,  expecting it to be the regular, run of the mill, sit down, look at the menu and order......Nope!!!\nwhile sitting by the pool, Chef Allanah, who is unbelievably lovely, came out to talk to us to get a feel for what type of things we both liked (which is great because i am very fussy). Later on that evening after the drinks reception on the roof, watching the sun go down, we sat for dinner. To our absolute amazement and delight, we were the only ones in the restaurant that evening so it became obvious that we were getting a personally cooked meal. Before the meal Allanah presented the menu to us, which sounded amazing and also before each course she came to tell us exactly what the dish was and how it was cooked (it was like an episode of Masterchef -The professionals...of course). Both of us had completely different courses, except desert and start to finish it was the nicest meal i have had to date!!! \n\nAll in all, It really made the last two days of our honeymoon very special. i would recommend this hotel to anyone, number one- its not expensive and number two- there are only 14 rooms so it feels so personal.\n\nThank you so much everyone\n\nJohn & Fiona",

At Luna2 we aim to provide our guests with an out-of-this-world experience and I am very happy you felt the service was second to none.

Easy walking distance to shopping and dining if you ever choose not to dine at Luna2, this place is great - great pool, great room, great food, and even greater staff, who go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable.

I will certainly pass on your comments to Ayu, as we are happy to provide her services, giving parents a nice break to enjoy dinner or sunset cocktails in Space rooftop bar. \r\nThank you also for the feedback on location. While we are in a fantastic location with close proximity to the beach, shops and dining, we do note that we are still a relatively new hotel, set away from the hustle and bustle of the main streets.  With this understanding, we do our best to accommodate taxis by being on Google Maps and providing directions on our website, and upon arrival, we have a clear and detailed area map that we recommend guests take to ensure they don\u2019t get lost while exploring the great shops and restaurants nearby. \r\nThank you again and we hope to welcome you back to Luna2 very soon. \r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n\r\nJessica Lee Cook\r\nFront Office Manager",

It's one of those finds that you want to keep to yourself but know it's not fair to the amazing team at Luna2 & the incredible space, both of which combine to make this an experience like no other. From the moment you walk through the big white door, it's like being Alice in Wonderland going down the Rabbit Hole. The confidence & commitment to design a hotel like this that doesn't follow the rules has won us over. This place is far from your average hotel, especially in Bali. The intimacy created by the wonderful team with Jessica & Helmut in charge is so welcoming & refreshing. Every staff member knows your name & nothing is too much trouble. They even clean your sunglasses when lazing around the pool in your own private daybed. The cocktails at Space Rooftop Bar are the best we have had anywhere in the world. You have to try their Negroni. Everything is done with a smile & a warm greeting. My husband & I have just enjoyed a 6 night stay in the Strand Suite. I could keep going forever, & giveaway all of their secrets, but you need to come & stay at this amazing place so you can find out the rest for yourselves. We will definitely be staying at Luna2Studiotel on our next visit to Bali. Thank you to all the team that made our visit here truly memorable.",

I would strongly recommend it to anyone who is planning to come to Bali with a family or group of people.

We stayed here for just 2 days after working in Bali for 5 months. And it was absolutely nothing like we expected! I have stayed in many hotels all over asia and europe and I must say, non of the hotels I have been to, could surprise me like this one did! \nWe had the Sunset Studio, one of a kind with a wonderful view over the ocean and a faboulous design! On our first night we didn't want to leave the hotel!\nWe had some Drinks at the Space bar, to our amusement they had the Pisco Sour which you can't get around here. We enjoyed the free canapes and watched the sun set. \nThen, we had the cinema all to our self and could choose a movie to watch. The club is cool too! We also had dinner, and honestly, I was blown away! The Chef came out, talket with us 5 minutes and created a amazing menu! She is living her dream cooking out of her head for her guests! you should definetly try their restaurant! \nNeedless to say, the staff is amazing, calling you by names and treating you like an old friend. If you are looking for a different experience than a traditional balinese hotel, this is the NR.1 you should be going to! If in Bali again-100% this hotel!",

I will be sure to pass your compliments onto Helmut, the Food & Beverage Manager for his pisco sour. Alana, the Chef de Cuisine, will also be extremely pleased to know how much you enjoyed her dinner menu.  I certainly will share your review with her and the whole team!\r\n \r\nFrom all of us at Luna2, we hope to be able to welcome you back  in the near future.\r\n \r\nKindest regards\r\n \r\nJessica \r\n\r\nJessica Lee Cook\r\nFront Office Manager",

Rooms have a retro style with really thought out detail, loved the music playing in the room and wanted to pinch the Audrey Hepburn coasters! Service was excellent throughout but the food for me was the highlight, visually stunning and every dish I had tasted delicious that I can't pick a favourite, chef Errol is truly talented. Must also mention perfectly made espresso martini's which eased the jet lag! I cannot wait to return here in June.",

              "text": "I always check trip advisor before booking a hotel. When I read the reviews for Luna2 I almost didn't believe them. How could a hotel be this amazing??\n\nWell it is! From the cold drinks and towels in the Lunamobile from the airport to the free (super high quality) babysitting, to the movie theatre and Pop club in the basement. The design is super chic, but it's the concept and the staff that make this place special. \n\nWe went as a family (two kids 3 and 1) with my sister and her husband.  Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. They made anything my kids wanted to eat and set up toys and a high chair in the Space rooftop bar so they could eat dinner and we could enjoy the sunset.\n\nAyu, the babysitter, was  outstanding with my two, and helped me feel at ease about leaving them to grab dinner in the evening.\n\nThe general manager was fantastic, he stopped by to see us everyday and ensured we had tables booked and transport arranged.\n\nNothing was too much trouble! I especially loved them coming by to clean your sunglasses at the pool!\n\nHands down the best hotel I have ever stayed at. We've been in Asia for three years and stayed at many wonderful places but this is on par with Nikoi (for those of you who have been there) obviously a very different concept and experience, but the quality and service is right up there!!\n\nCan't wait to go back :)",

It is excellent to read that our staff welcomed you back on a first name basis and remembered your beverage of choice.  I will be sure to pass on your kind words regarding the cocktails and food service to Helmut Roessler, our Food & Beverage Manager. You were extremely lucky to be coincidently staying when we were showing the \u201cfight of the century\u201d in Lunaplex cinema, and I hope you enjoyed the champagne breakfast and signature breakfast baps. \r\n \r\nOn behalf of the entire team we look forward to welcoming you back for the third time this year.\r\n \r\nKindest regards\r\nJessica \r\nJessica Lee Cook | Front Office Manager | Luna2",

              "text": "Luna2 is a fantastic place, in an amazing location, and a bit of a trip in its own right... Strikes a really great note between high style and warm welcome. We arrived via the space-shuttle-ish van service Luna provides from the airport, were greeted by name by the entire really sweet staff, and had a late dinner downstairs, just after checking in, that oddly made our weekend - no menu, just a quick chat with the chef, and then best meal in 6 months in Indo... still grateful for that. \n\nOur room and view were great, if even more Sputnik than we needed - go for the upper floors if you can. There's a lot of design going on, but I actually liked the overall architecture as much as all the Pop details - it's a really well-thought out place. The space and game theme had our 8-year old captivated immediately, from Monopoly, everywhere, to Mondrian in the pool, and I wish I had caught a movie in the theater below. And the surf 100' away is great - my first barrel in Bali - though I may wait for dry season for more there. Hope to be back soon.",

With a retro musically inspired vibe, but modern at the same time and spacious we knew we had saved the best hotel for the last of our journey... The attention to detail was impressive, from the iPad which was available to use for guests which also outlines all facilities and menus for the hotel, to the Barrocca vitamin pills useful after a night out in seminyak. The beds were comfortable and the best part is the hotel is peaceful but perfectly located to the city, the beach and has its own private pool where you are secluded from the scooters of Bali.. The staff were amazing, Leslie took time out to share a cocktail with us on the rooftop, Jessica was always on point to remind us of what was happening that night in the area and giving advise on where to eat and drink and Helmut the food and beverage manager knew exactly what we needed at any given time of the day including amazing Bloody Mary's at breakfast! I would highly recommend this hotel. If you are looking for a modern feel, some peace and quiet but also with the possibility to hit the town, or go for some local shopping or food Luna2 is the place!",

We had a sunset dinner arranged for us at the rooftop bar, it was beautiful. and great with kids as you get to enjoy beautiful food with an amazing view without needing to arrange babysitters or drag your kids around town. They will make whatever food you want for your kids.  We had inter-connecting rooms. The kids loved the pool, cinema, mini (maxi) bar, the tv in the bath, the lego and monopoly decor. We loved the food and the service.  Its not really a normal family hotel I suppose but we were very comfortable there.  Although we couldn't afford to stay too long as once you start getting inter-connecting rooms the price adds up, even with discounted rates. We used the free pass to splash waterpark, it wasn't that great for our aged kids (5 and 7) but it was a fun afternoon out and it was good to check it out.\n\nThe only minor issue I had, which was my fault,  was that I managed to look myself out on the balcony. Fortunately my husband was in the pool and could come and rescue me. Not sure how I did it as you need to have the door in the lock position for it to happen, but somehow I managed it. \n\nWe would definitely return. Thanks for a great stay.",

At Luna2, we feel that kids are cool too, so I am glad your children were able to enjoy all aspects of our studiotel, including the visionary and fun design, the Mondrian-ic outdoor pool and our famous MAXI bar.\r\n\r\nThank you for the feedback regarding the ages for Splash waterpark; we will be sure to make a note of this for future guests. \r\n\r\nRegarding the balcony door, I am happy your husband was able to come to your rescue, and our maintenance team have assured me this will not happen again. \r\n\r\nThank you again, and we look forward to welcoming you back to Luna2 studiotel in the future.\r\n \r\nKind regards \r\n\r\nJessica \r\n\r\nJessica Lee Cook | Front Office Manager | Luna2",

              "text": "I am writing this review after my second stay at Luna2. \n\nA re-routed flight meant I had to spend one night in Bali before carrying on to Sydney - I landed with a broken phone and no access to the Internet. Based on my previous experience at Luna2 I refused to consider staying anywhere else so got a taxi to the resort. Fortunately for me Jessica (Front Office Manager) was on reception and recognised me immediately and came around the counter for a hug - a welcome end to a 72 hour journey and the kind of personal touch that makes Luna2 stand out.\n\nHaving explained my situation I was whisked off to the roof top bar for a few complimentary drinks and canap\u00e9s with the GM while my room was prepared. After the original disappointment of a rerouted flight by this point I couldn't have been happier to be in Bali!\n\nThe room was a suite and incredible, which I have come to expect rather than hope for. \n\nThe levels of staff service remained the same, everyone remembered my name and all asked about the wellbeing of my partner - I was especially looked after by Adi and Windu who feel more like friends than hotel staff!\n\nSince my last trip Luna2 have hired a new, experienced chef with a CV that includes a number of award winning and Michelin starred restaurants in London. Erroll was a brilliant hire who, despite my high expectations, actually delivered better food than previously and he insisted on tracking me down and sharing a few beers with me when he knew I was travelling alone and up for a good time! I considered going above and beyond his duty, the fact his company was so enjoyable was an added bonus. \n\nI won't be surprised when Luna2 becomes the Number One rated hotel in Seminyak - it's only a matter of time so I would advise to book now while they still have availability. I wouldn't typically write such a stellar review out of fear of the prices going up so much (!) but the quality and service of the staff, hotel and amenities means that I would be doing them a disservice in not doing so.\n\nI look forward to seeing everyone there again soon.\n\nRegards, \nShaun",

Very spacious, all switches clearly labelled, plug in for iPhone to music station, personal iPad provided in the room, nice large balcony, refreshing decor. Though no ocean view, it is just a 1 minute walk to the beach, and a great ocean view from the roof deck hotel bar. A memorable experience indeed.\nLars Amstrup",

My wife and I booked the sunset balcony room, and were wowed by the room.  The location is also unbeatable - a 5 minute walk not he beach to Ku-De-Ta and surf / beach bumming at your doorstep.\n\nWe did have some real issues with our A/C - but the hotel did everything possible to fix quickly, and they did make it right in the end.\n\nA highlight of our visit was Jessica, the insanely friendly and patient manager that helped our hand through issues, as well as surf lessons.  Jessica was always smiling, and I can honestly say that she is a huge part of why I recommend this place. \n\nDon't bother looking around - this is the spot! Ask for Jessica!",

It feels like an oasis and you can forget your in bali! We stayed in the ground floor studio suite 'strand on ground' and was red and London themed. From the moment you walk in its luxury, and nostalgic of 60s British pop. Everything is well thought out and I only wish I could stay longer. The breakfast is delicious and ALL staff are spectacular. Thanks to Jessica and the team for a great final few days in Seminyak. Highly recommended and can't wait to come back to this gem in Bali. ",

Jessica and her staff were super attentive from our arrival until departure. She was eager to throw in suggestions for dinner, excursions and helped us hire a personal driver to drive us Ubud. She exceeded my expectations throughout our vacation. \n\nThe food at their restaurant was absolutely amazing. Our group was obsessed with the \"breakfast bap\" and the  \"nase goreng.\" Kudos to Chef Brenndon. His culinary skills are impeccable! He also chatted with us and made an excellent suggestion to check out Nikki Beach and Finn's Beach. Thank you! Our group had an amazing time. \n\nI definitely recommend staying at Luna2!",

Its quirky and fun and the staff are absolutely fantastic. They couldn't do enough for us. Everything about this hotel is brilliant - from enjoying a lovely cocktail at the rooftop bar to snuggling up and watching a movie in the basement cinema (with a waitress on hand!!). The food was delicious and well presented. They even gave us a little Christmas present which was so thoughtful. I honestly can not recommend this hotel enough. If you fancy something a little different with the friendliest staff ever - then this is the hotel for you!\n\nA special mention to Jessica and Brenden for being so accommodating!\n\nKirsty & Jack",

The Bond-style decor is incredible and small touches, like champagne on arrival (served by a 1960s air hostess) and an iPod loaded with 60s tunes in the room, made the stay even more surreal. The huge room was also complete with a free iPad for use during the stay, perfect for lazing by the colourful pool. \n\nStaff were so friendly and welcoming - they really went out of their way to ensure your stay was perfect. Drinks at the Sunset Bar were complimented with tiny, delicious canap\u00e9s. Breakfast was a feast of delights and all served with a smile.\n\nI could not recommend this hotel more. It was a complete experience and not what you would expect from Bali. It felt like a weird and wonderful time capsule away from the hectic streets of Seminyak. Do yourself a favour and book a room!

              "text": "We stayed at Luna2 for six nights and it was hands down the best hotel we have stayed in, in terms of uniqueness, size of room, quality and availability of amenities and service of staff. We arrived late on a Saturday evening and instead of arrival drinks we had a warm flask of hot chocolate and home made cookies in our room waiting for us. Amazing!\n\nThe hotel itself is a clean and modern presentation of the British Pop Art culture; I half expected the Beatles to walk around the corner any minute or find myself in the middle of a magazine shoot. The owner has kept a very close eye on the smallest of details and you might not appreciate them until you leave to your next hotel; something as simple as international plug sockets next to sink basins (as well as Indonesian plugs) was appreciated and designed with international and local clientele in mind. \n\nThe pool area was peaceful and pleasant and less than a five minute walk to the beach. Location wise the hotel is right in the middle of Seminyak, a five minute walk down the beach to Ku De Ta and ten minutes to Potato Head however once you are inside the resort it feels like it is just you and ocean; truly peaceful.\n\nAs food lovers from Sydney we have unreasonably high expectations of our food but ate at Luna most days due to the extraordinary creations from Brandon the Australian chef whose food competes with the finest restaurants in Sydney. Particularly recommend is his truffle and mushroom soup. Brandon was also a great source of recommendations for some of the lesser known places to eat in Bali ensuring that when we did leave the resort we only experienced the very best at reasonable prices.\n\nThe roof deck bar is a must and perfect for cocktails and beers watching the sunset between 6-8pm. I'd also recommend the cinema and night club for late night activities where services (drinks and popcorn or a blanket) are only at the push of a button away.\n\nFinally the service; we really did feel like A-List stars at this place, I cannot speak highly enough of Jessica who went above and beyond what we would expect of a Front Office Manager; a lovely person genuinely interested in making your stay in Bali (not just her hotel) as memorable as possible. The guests are outnumbered by staff which makes you feel truly pampered, and literally everyone knows and remembers your name giving the stay a 'personal feel'. Special mentions to Aki, Wundi and Brandon who became more like friends than service providers! \n\nAll in all a spectacular resort at which we couldn't find a fault. We will be coming back for sure, and started looking forward to our next stay before we had even finished this one. Thanks for an amazing Christmas Luna2. \n\nShaun & Laura, Sydney \n\nPS. thanks for the surprise Xmas presents in our room when we returned for bed on Xmas evening, a great treat, much unexpected and truly appreciated!",

Wether it be the gorgeous staff or the super cool interiors, my stay at Luna2 was simply brilliant. \n\nMany of the hotels in Bali are much the same and being able to find somewhere so exciting and different was a total treat. Its not often that you can say that a hotel excites you, but this is exactly what Luna2 Studiotel does. The staff are all so polite and helpful and when you combine this with simply delicious food it makes for a brilliant experience. \n\nI can't write and not mention the rooms. Luna2 Studiotel really does blow your mind away when it comes to an alternative hotel set up. The rooms are all furnished to perfection with amazingly comfy beds, all the gadgets that you could want and a huge bathroom. Yet the hotel manages to achieve all of this with incredible sophistication and exciting design. Just look at the website and you will see what I mean. \n\nYet if your not someone who likes to stay in, why, there are a multitude of beach bars a short walk away. The hotel has two incredible bars (Pop and Space), both of which make the evenings a lot of fun. The cocktail list was particularly impressive. Or, if you didn't feel like a drink the 16 seater private cinema was a great way to spend any evening and with a film collection like theirs I nearly went every night!\n\nIf your in Bali and bored of the same old set ups go and see this place, it will take your breath away. \n\nLastly I cannot thank the hotel enough for giving me such a memorable and happy stay.",

I booked this hotel via telephone only 8 hours before my flight to Bali, greeted by a very friendly staff and my reservation was immediately confirmed. We arrived at the hotel at 10pm and were greeted by the front office staff(who was super friendly to us thru out our stay but i did not get his name unfortunately) by my name! We were brought to our room 2 minutes later and when we entered the room, my wife and I went WOW! We both commented that this will be the best hotel we will ever stayed at and we were right. The room (and the entire hotel in general) has a retro and hippy feel to it. The room has 3 televisions, a (at least) 5 metres sofa, kitchen area with complete cooking stove and eating utensils, bathtub, separate (rain) shower and toilet area, his and hers vanity sink, king size bed, an ipod with a kickass playlist to go with the mood of hotel theme, balcony overlooking a super cool looking swimming pool !!! I can go on and on with the room amenities actually. The breakfast has a unique concept unlike the ones you usually will see in hotels/resorts. The hotel has only about 14 rooms and we were one of only few ones there so all the staffs are more than willing to talk with you and help you out no matter what the request is. The hotel is about 5 to 10 minutes by taxi to Seminyak Square and about 30 minutes to the airport. Seminyak beach is 30 seconds walk from the hotel and Ku De Ta is 5 minutes walk along the beach! After checking out, we decided to go out to Seminyak Square for 1 last shopping trip and foot massage. We came back 2 hours later to watch a movie at the hotel's movie theatre. YES! You read it right. The hotel has a 16 seater movie theatre with huge comfortable reclining seats! We refreshed ourselves after the movie and the staff gladly booked a taxi for us to the airport. The entire team consisting the manager, security, front office staff, porter all waved us goodbye when we boarded taxi. In the taxi, my wife and I said - finally, we have found a hotel that we WILL come back to whenever we come to Bali.",

Thank you for taking the time to post your review, I am extremely pleased to hear from the moment you contacted us for your last minute reservation all the way through to when you departed Luna2 studiotel, your stay was seamless and exceeded your expectation. \r\n\r\nI am delighted to also read that you were able to experience many of the aspects of Luna2 - our close proximity to the beach and Seminyak, and especially all of the amenities that we provide our guests in the studios, not to mention the d\u00e9cor and design.  We are also very pleased that you were able to come back and experience Lunaplex and our ultra-plush recliners. I will be sure to pass on your comments to Chef Brenden and his F&B team. As you pointed out, and many of our guests agree, our breakfast offering certainly is a standout on the island, and Chef will be happy to know your thoughts. \r\n\r\nWe will look forward to welcoming you and your wife back to Luna2 studiotel. Please contact me personally for your future reservation.  \r\n\r\nRegards\r\nJessica Lee Cook | Front Office Manager | Luna2",

Room is big, 60sqm, nicely equipped with 3 tvs, big fridge, stove and kitchen utensils, all in modern retro style. Pool, a bit narrow but 30m long, great for laps, after dining here and there in Bali. Seminyak beach, is 2mins walk, nice to walk around, swim or play boogie board, while roof top lounge offer great views for sunset or just to chill in the afternoon. There is a lounge with under water view at the basement, while home theatre, with 10 seats, is a massive plus as well. Overall, great stay at Luna2 and would definetely stay again, assuming room rate stays!",

The restaurant has amazing food and the chef likes to make small treats for the guests who are lounging by the pool.  The room was fantastic with a great, sunny balcony overlooking the pool.  It is also a very, very short walk to the beach.  The staff will help you book anything you need for your stay in Bali: scooters, tours, bikes, etc.  The rooftop lounge is an amazing place to watch the sun set every night.  I will definitely stay there every time I visit Seminyak.  It is also kid friendly and they have movies in the basement for both children and adults.  Great place!!!!",

Arriving from Ubud we were looking forward for a few days relaxing at the beach. If you love beach then hotel is perfectly situated.. just a few steps and you are on the beach. When we stayed here, at the end of october beach in this location was not busy...\nRooms at hotel are huge, we had their cheapest room and were amazed on size. All clean, everything is available. You could even cook your own meal in small kitchen.\nThere is a big swimming pool which was quiet too so could do some proper swimming in the mornings.\nThere is as well roof terrace where we had a few cocktails while watching beautiful sunset.\nBreakfast was very well prepared and delicious! Kind of regret we did not have dinner there.... \nService wise we did not experienced any issues maybe a small mistake on our final bill can be mentioned but it was all corrected within minutes...\nI enjoyed this property and definitely would stay again when back in Seminyak in Bali....",

I am delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay and were able to experience many of the aspects of Luna2 that so many of our guests enjoy - our close proximity to the beach, spacious studios, 25m lap pool, and of course completing the day with cocktails Space rooftop bar for sunset. I will be sure to pass on your compliments to the team in particular the chefs regarding our breakfast offering, and we hope you will join us for dinner in Orbit when you next visit.  We do apologise for the discrepancy on your bill, I am happy to learn that the team was able to rectify it promptly for you. \r\n\r\nIt was a pleasure to have you stay with us, and we look forward to welcoming you back to Luna2 in the future. \r\n \r\nKindest regards \r\n\r\nJessica\r\n\r\nJessica Lee Cook | Front Office Manager | Luna2",

Think monopoly boards, primary colours, retro 50s and modern art.  If you're after something a little bit special in a hotel - this is the place for you.\n\nWhen we arrived we were welcomed with complimentary champagne, chocolate, a cool face towel and friendly staff with exceptional English - perfect after a 1.5 hour drive from Padang Bai without air-con. \n\nWe also met fellow Australians Jessica (Front Officer Manager) and Brendan (Executive Chef) who were amazing!  \n\nJess helped arrange everything throughout our stay - a Scooter, day trips, Tour to Ubud, restaurant referrals and bookings - the list goes on!  Nothing was ever a hassle and it gave us piece of mind having a local help guide us through our first trip to Bali.\n\nBrendan's food is fantastic, make sure you order dinner at least once while you stay!  Brendan also gave us the insiders knowledge about Bali's best restaurants, the locals and where the best chefs source their ingredients from - we spent 2 weeks in Bali and didn't get sick, he knows his food!\n\nThe attention to detail in the hotel was exceptional, the room we stayed in (the standard Studio room) was perfect - the bed was super comfy, the pillows were amazing, the shower was huge and I swear the whole place was cleaned at least 3 times a day!\n\nThe photos of the rooms on the website really don't do them justice.  They are huge, each have a colour theme and come equipped with an iPad, iPod & dock, 3 TVs, HUGE bathroom and so much more.  \n\nThe pool area is great with comfortable lounges and service buttons so that you don't even have to get up for a cocktail.  The immaculately dressed waitresses are happy to bring out anything you wish (they are kitted out in knee high boots and 50s style matching hats and dresses - lovely touch). \n\nDownstairs there is a 16 seat private cinema which plays 3 times per day - you can order popcorn and drinks and the chairs are amazing!  There is also a nightclub-like lounge bar next to the cinema if you'd rather a few drinks (or the rooftop bar for sunsets!) \n\nAll in all we ABSOLUTELY LOVED this hotel. By far the best that either of us had experienced before in terms of amenities, attention to detail and service. We have already booked our next flights back! \n\n100% recommend staying at Luna 2 - you won't be disappointed! \n\nDarren & Ashlee",

We loved its boutique feel with only about 15 rooms. The rooms were large and quiet with the funkiest decor with amazing attention to detail in its space age theme. Retro-chic! The pool was shaped to swim laps and was bold and colourful in its design with comfortable lounge pods to laze on. The \"Pod\" bar area downstairs was like entering an Austin Powers' fantasy. There is also a funky private theatre downstairs where movies are shown regularly, with popcorn, and if no other guests turn up, you can choose your own film rather than watch the scheduled movie. The rooftop bar is a cool place to enjoy the complimentary snacks with your beer and enjoy the view. The staff were ever polite and attentive. I would particularly like to mention Jessica the front of house manager who looked after us with warm and ever- helpful advice.",

He's down to earth and does much more than what he's required to do..\nThe whole staff is nice and smiling, the rooms are spacious and well equipped..they have a pillow menu..yup.\n\nAnyway the place is highly recommended for Seminyak..\nThanks for the staff for making this friendly atmosphere.. \n",

We wanted a change from a Balinese style resort and was won over to. Luna 2 Studiotel based on the wonderful reviews we read on. TripAdvisor. \nAfter a rather anxious search for the hotel by our driver from Ubud, we were pleasantly surprised by the refreshing champagne and chocolate and the warm greetings of the staff at Luna 2 including Jessica & Exec Chef Brendan, upon our arrival.\nOur room, Bond on 3, was amazing and way beyond our expectations. Everything in the room was colourful, well designed and funky, coloured co-ordinated in green and functional. We posted various images of the room on our Facebook and our friends were 'green with envy'\nBreakfast was excellent and we loved the different combo fresh juices on offer. Executive Chef Brendan was ever so attentive and always that we were happy with the menu. He even discussed our dinner menu with us to ensure that it met with our dietary needs and preferences. The dinner was excellent and delicious and we decided to dine at Luna2 again on our last night rather than our earlier preference for another fine dining restaurant nearby. \nLocation wise, it was just a short walk to Seminyak beach. The walk along the beach at Sunset was lovely and the stretch to Double 6 beach was so vibrant at night. Initially we did have some problems finding our bearings but eventually we realised that the hotel is just about 10 mins away from the shopping street of Jln Raya Seminyak and the many restaurants and bars nearby.\nThe staff at Luna2 were extremely friendly, polite, helpful and attentive. The masseur that I had for an in room massage was rather good. Daily one or more of the senior staff would inquire about our stay and our needs and we truly appreciate their warm gestures.\nWe would highly recommend Luna2 Studiotel to all our friends. We would definitely come back to this hotel when we do visit. Bali again.",

              "text": "We rarely felt inspired to post on Tripadvisor but our stay in Luna2 over the weekend has motivated us to help spread the good word on the hotel, and maybe kickstart our writing career with Tripadvisor.  \n\nWe've stayed in a ton of hotels over the years and we were hoping for an \"in between\" hotel this time in Bali.  We want the comfort of a five-star hotel but the quaint factor of a boutique.  After some scouring and researching, we landed ourselves a booking with Luna2 for a Studio room.  Like a 5-star hotel, they acceded to helping us make reservations at various restaurants, arranging for airport pick up, and preparing a birthday cake to be sent to our room.  \n\nWe'd recommend booking the airport transfer although you do end up paying up more than the usual taxi ride.  We landed at midnight and was glad to sift out our driver easily amidst the sea of name boards/placards at the arrival hall with his illuminated board.  We were ushered to a mini van, and were served a bottle of appropriately chilled white wine as the driver quietly drives on.  Disclaimer; I suspect the complimentary wine might have been a special service as one of us was celebrating a birthday but you can order a soda or a glass of wine the moment you board the mini van (driver would hand out a drinks menu).  \n\nWe arrived at the hotel past midnight and were greeted by two members of staff with the professionalism you'd expect from a good hotel.  Checking in was a breeze and took no more than ten minutes.  The room was exactly as the hotel website depicts; large, comfortable, and colourful.  The hotel even took the liberty to leave us a bottle of warm chocolate milk and cookies for a late night snack.  Bathroom was large, but there was no door to it and only a glass to separate the room from it, so you'd expect couples to be more comfortable in this setting.  You can find the basic amenities in the bathroom, and if they aren't provided free of charge, you can simply take them from a well-stocked shelf in the bathroom and pay prices you would at a convenient store.  It's a breath of fresh air since we are used to hotels charging us exorbitant prices for the smallest things.  If there is anything the hotel could improve on in its inventory is to provide some bedroom slippers.  \n\nWe would also recommend arranging for full body massage.  While there isn't the fanfare of a high end spa with elaborate forms for patrons to fill out and jars of scents to choose from, we did get very good massages with a view to kill.  On one of the two massages we arranged for, we had it in the private villa (next door to the studiotel) overlooking the sea.  They even had one of the rooms in the villa prepared (air con and music turned on) for us to change out of our clothes in.  On the second occasion, they had massage tables prepared in 15 minutes after our call in the rooftop bar of the hotel, also overlooking the sea.  Look for Widya for a very good massage.  \n\nThe location of the hotel is another plus point.  It is essentially a five minute walk on the beach to Ku de ta, and maybe ten minute to Potato Head Beach club although we took a taxi for the latter.  The path on the beach at night is not very well lit, but it's safe and comfortable to walk on.  Everywhere that mattered is just a taxi ride away, and fares are usually very cheap (about IDR 30,000 to most places).  We saw some small cars parked outside of the hotel and would assume those are for rental if you're adventurous enough to explore tight driveways in Balinese fashion.  \n\nBreakfast is a semi-buffet affair which we preferred served to the room.  You can choose to have it in the restaurant as well.  We also had the \"in-flight dining\" during one of the dinners, which is basically dinner served compact on a tray to your room as you would on board a flight.  In all fairness, we felt this was something you could do away.  We read in some reviews of good fettuccine alfredo but unfortunately the \"in-flight\" menu did not include it.  Really, we had the choice of chicken or beef (like you would on board a flight), and while they taste good, they are somewhat forgettable.  We recommend, however, going for a movie and a meal (hotdog sandwich+beer/bubbly) in the private cinema in the basement.  They have three time slots for their showing and movies are very current.  If you are from Singapore, the seats and services in this 16-seater cinema are basically like GV Gold Class, fully recline-able seats with call buttons for service.  \n\nSome nit-picking; We were hoping there'd be some parties at the roof top on Saturday night but it was unfortunately closed.  There were some mosquitoes while we were hanging out in the balcony at night, but nothing too uncontrollable.  \n\nIf privacy is something you hold dear to, this hotel is a superb choice.  While we see a few couples during breakfast or heading back to their rooms, we had just the right amount of privacy otherwise.\n\nNicholas and Jingle",

                     "text": "Dear Velvetsage,\r\n\r\nGreetings from Luna2 and thank you for your recent stay with us. I want to thank you personally for your detailed review. Guests\u2019 perspective is of the utmost importance to us, and your constructive feedback is extremely valuable for our team.\r\n\r\nWe are very pleased to hear that Luna2 studiotel exceeded your expectations, as we do provide 5* services but with exclusivity and privacy not found at resorts. Our team will be very happy to know that the special birthday surprises and small gestures like hot cocoa and cookies as a late-night snack on arrival did not go unnoticed. We are thrilled that you celebrated your birthday with us, and we hope we made it a memorable one. \r\n\r\nThank you for your comments regarding our airport pickup. It is a service that many of our guests rave about, due to the convenience over taxis and the amenities our drivers serve enroute to Luna2. I must let you know that the wine is complimentary as part of the service, but I am pleased that it added to your birthday celebrations. \r\n\r\nI will definitely pass on your comments regarding the massages to our spa team. As you mentioned, we do not have a full spa like other resorts, but we do have very talented massage therapists on-site who are able to provide massages and reflexology treatments in-room, poolside, or even on the rooftop or next door on the ocean-view terrace at Luna2 private hotel (if available). I will share your compliments with Widya.  \r\n\r\nOur in-house movie theatre, Lunaplex, continues to be a favourite attraction for our guests, and I am very pleased you were able to enjoy our selection of new releases and our famous hot dogs! Regarding your other meal, I will share your comments regarding the \u2018in-flight\u2019 dining to our chefs.  We pride ourselves on providing this in-room dining experience that is above and beyond normal room service dining. We appreciate your feedback, and will strongly consider including more menu options along with other enhancements so that this experience is on par with our food & beverage offerings in our other venues. \r\n\r\nMany of our guests, like you, also enjoy the premium selection of amenities in the essentials bar in every room. We are happy to provide these items for them, and we know how convenient they can be when you arrive late at night. Regarding your comment on providing slippers, we are actually discussing our in-room amenities and your recommendation is very appreciated. In addition, we were happy you were able spend some time on your private balcony, but it is unfortunate that the mosquitoes made it less enjoyable. We do provide mosquito spray in the essentials bar that you can have for your entire trip, or our staff can provide some for you for the evening. We do our best to minimise mosquitoes through regular fogging, as they are a common nuisance in Bali.  \r\n\r\nWe continually aim to meet high standards for the personalised, attentive service that you experienced.  Additionally, I am also glad that you were able to walk down the beach to KU DE TA and Potatohead. We are fortunate to have such a location, close to some of Seminyak\u2019s best bars and restaurants, with the resorts providing enough light for a nice night-time walk on the beach. The fleet of cars, or Lunamobiles as we call them, that you noticed in the parking lot are available upon request, with our drivers able to provide drop-offs within Seminyak or reserved for daytrips. \r\n\r\nThank you once again for sharing your feedback with us and everyone on TripAdvisor.  My team and I continue to work hard to please every Luna2 guest. We would love to welcome you to Luna2 again, (possibly for another birthday next year!) so please feel free to contact me personally at +62 361 730 402 for any queries as I am happy to assist.\r\n\r\nThank you again, and we look forward to continue attracting more guests to Luna2 and the Island of Gods.\r\n\r\nWith kind regards,\r\n\r\nJessica Lee Cook | Front Office Manager | Luna2",

From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we had the most awesome experience. \nThe hotel, is stylish, funky and the rooms are large, clean, modern and extremely comfortable. The attention to detail was extraordinary and they seemed to think of absolutely everything. \nWe were met the GM on arrival who introduced us to his very efficient and friendly team, we were offered champagne and chocolates which was a nice change from a scented towel and horrible fruit juice!  \nFrom then on the whole experience was a smooth ride and something we didn't want to end.\nThe location is amazing and great being so close to the beach, 5 mins walk to Kudata.\nThe breakfast was absolutely delicious and the lovely head chef would pop over every morning for a quick chat and to see how we were.\nThe only thing I would say is the cocktails by the pool were a little expensive and could have had a bit more originality to them to go with the funky hotel theme. \nWe had booked into the W hotel after this one but to be honest I wish we'd just stayed here for the whole trip as after the standard this hotel set it was very hard to beat.\nWe've told everyone we know about this amazing gem of a hotel as its definitely up there with one of our most favorite hotels we've ever stayed in.\nThe only negative thing I can  say is how long we're going to have to wait to come back!!!

As an artist, the hotel itself was an absolute visual feast. Really felt like I was in another world, so much colour and fun pop art  detail.\nI felt a bit like I was on the set of Barbarella in my amazing studio. I'll definitely be back again soon to spend my days swimming in the delicious Mondrian pool, with friends and my little one. Definitely suitable for singles, couples or families. Loved it.

              "text": "I seldom review the hotels that I stayed in unless I was wow-ed by them and Luna2 Studiotel is definitely worth writing for. \n\nWe stayed at Luna2 Studiotel for 3 nights (16-19 September 2014). This is our 2nd time in Bali and we didn't want to stay in a Balinese-style villa, which we did the last time. I chanced upon Luna2 Studiotel on mrandmrssmith website and was attracted to it immediately! Prior to arrival at the hotel, I contacted the hotel via email for some enquiries and requests, and replies were informative and swift. Thanks Carina!\n\nOn checking in, which was quick and hassle-free, we were served champagnes, chocolates and cold towels, and personally greeted by the GM Jonah who was friendly and even recommended us some restaurants to try in Seminyak. He was chatty, personable and made us feel welcomed.\n\nThe room was spacious, clean and comfortable.\n\nThe hotel design was vibrant and fun, full of colourful pop-art. We particularly liked the cute Monopoly-inspired decorations littered throughout the hotel. The hotel looks exactly as the photos we've seen online: colourful, fun and unique, so much so that I do not have to post any photos below for reference! The pool was awesome and we had a great splashing time there swimming or just lying around on the cute floats. We were lucky and had the whole pool to ourselves when we were there. In fact, as there are only 14 rooms in the hotel, during our entire stay there, we only bumped into 1-2 other customers and the whole place felt very private, which was what we wanted on our vacations. The other interesting feature of the hotel is a 16-seat cinema which was comfortable and had 3 screenings/day.\n\nThe staff at Luna2 Studiotel were polite, friendly, helpful, attentive and knowledgeable. Their smiles really lit up our days. They helped us a lot in making and confirming our restaurant and spa reservations, as well as arranging transport for us. Most importantly, they respected our privacy and were not intrusive. Kudos to them! Service was impeccable. In the evenings, they prepared water for us in the room, as well as light jazzy music, which was a pleasant surprise when we returned to our room after a day out.\n\nThe location of the hotel was ideal. It was just a very short walk to and from Seminyak Beach. We walked all the way from Potato Head Beach Club back to the hotel via Seminyak Beach at sunset and it was lovely. The hotel is tucked away in a quiet corner, away from the hustle and bustle of Seminyak, yet it takes only 5-10 minutes by taxi to the many restaurants and bars in Seminyak.\n\nWe were supposed to have an 'in-flight' dinner from our booking but we declined as we wanted to try out some of the famous/popular restaurants in Bali. However the chef prepared a delicious take-away breakfast for us on check-out as our flight to Yogyakarta (our next holiday destination) was very early in the morning.\n\nAll in all, we had a great time and will definitely recommend Luna2 Studiotel to all our friends and family who are visiting Bali. In fact, many of them were excited looking at our photos!\n\nIf only we had to nit-pick, maybe there are a few small things that Luna2 Studiotel could improve on:\n1) May want to consider providing basic amenities such as toothbrush and toothpaste instead of selling them. Also, may want to consider providing complimentary snacks/drinks on top of the usual bottled water, coffee and tea.\n2) We find the airport transfer (both the VIP and the regular transfer) really too expensive. May want to consider providing complimentary airport transfer, or work this into the price of the hotel booking.\n3) We find certain parts of the pool to be quite deep and it'll be good if staff can look out into the pool on and off to ensure the safety of people using the pool.\n4) May want to consider screening more light-hearted 'holiday-friendly' movies in the cinema. We watched a heavy weird thriller movie and fell asleep (the sofas were super comfy) and then left before the movie ended.\n5) There were mosquitoes in the room (as with most places in Bali) and we requested for electrical mosquito repellants but they weren't available, so the staff helped us to Baygon-spray the room and left it with us for us to use later. May be good to provide electrical mosquito repellants as the sprays were smelly and suffocating! Luckily we usually spray and then left for dinner, so by the time we come back, the smell is gone.\n6) Some small detail: When we were there, the handle of the shower 'electrocuted' us MILDLY a few times when we touched it when showering. We fedback to the hotel and hopefully this has been sorted out.\n\nI do not want these few small things to take away from the great time that we had staying at Luna2 Studiotel. We came back to Singapore refreshed and recharged from the great time in Bali and Yogyakarta and Luna2 Studiotel contributed greatly to our wonderful experience!",

                     "text": "Dear Boon81\r\n\r\nGreetings from Seminyak, Bali and thank you for your recent stay with us. I want to thank you personally for your extensive review, since our guests' perspective is of the utmost importance to us. Your constructive feedback is valuable for our team as well as for readers and visitors from all around the world.\r\n\r\nWe are very pleased to hear that you were \u201cwow-ed\u201d by Luna2 studiotel. I am glad that you enjoyed the design, as it is just one of the many features that distinguishes us from other hotels and Balinese-style villas. I am particularly pleased that you found the service to be \u201cimpeccable,\u201d and I will be sure to share that with our team. They will be pleased to know that small gestures such as reservations, transport, packing breakfast, and music for nightly turndown did not go unnoticed. We continually aim to meet high standards for the personalised, attentive service that you experienced.  Additionally, I am also glad that you were able to walk down the beach to Potatohead. We are fortunate to be so close to some of Seminyak\u2019s best bars and restaurants. \r\n\r\nI also want to thank you for providing constructive feedback, and we will be sure to address all points with serious consideration.\r\n\r\nWe do provide an in-room essentials bar, with any necessary amenities our guests may need. While these are premium products and are available for purchase, we do have standard items like toothpaste and toothbrushes available complimentary for all guests. All they have to do is ask, and our housekeeping team will deliver to their studio. The items in the essentials are exceptionally well priced, I would also point out the at the essentials items are charged at the same price as the local convenience stores which is simply unheard of in hotels. \r\n\r\nOur VIP airport transfer service is often a favourite experience to many of our guests. It typically includes a meet-and-greet and fast-track through airport immigration. The fast-track service is currently suspended by the Bali airport authorities through the high season, but we continue to provide cold towels and refreshments as a welcoming experience to Bali. We will discuss ways to incorporate the service into packages and rates. \r\n\r\nWe are glad you were able to enjoy Lunaplex, our on-site private cinema. We try to keep up with the latest releases with a different movie every night, but we do have a library full of classics and comedies. Guests can occasionally request to change the movie, if no one else is using the cinema at that time. We also understand that after a day of sun or swimming in the pool, it is easy to fall asleep in the plush recliners. \r\n\r\nThank you for your feedback regarding the depth of the pool.  As you experienced, it is a very large, 25m lap pool, and with only 14 rooms, guests often enjoy having the entire pool to themselves.  There is a shallow end, and there is an on-site kids coordinator to watch children in the pool, but I will discuss with the staff to be more attentive of all guests using the pool. \r\n\r\nAdditionally it is with regret to learn that you had issues with mosquito's. While mosquito's are a common issue in Bali, we go to great lengths to minimise them for the comfort of our guests. Our exterminator fogging externally twice monthly and all doors to guestrooms are sealed when closed. This is a rare case, I will discuss the issue with our housekeeping and maintenance teams on how to remedy this in the future.\r\n\r\nThe issue regarding your shower was addressed immediately after you checked out, and it has been fixed.  Thank you for bringing it to our attention, as the safety of our guests is always of top priority. \r\n\r\nThank you once again for sharing your feedback with us and everyone on TripAdvisor.

The hotel is so small, nestled in the middle of the big resorts in Seminyak\u2026 but it\u2019s perfect!  We were treated like celebrities!  We had champagne as soon as we arrived, then massages by the pool on the huge daybeds.  We could walk up the beach to Kudeta, and the taxi to Metis wasn\u2019t more than 10 minutes.  Everyone at this hotel is so nice, and we were even able to reserve a driver to take us to brunch and shopping.  I feel like we could have asked for anything, and they would have done it.  I will remember that for next time.  I hope my girlfriend stays in Bali for a long time, because we have to come back and see everyone at Luna2 again.  \n \nTip:  Luday gives the best massages!",

Starting with the superb location in the center of Seminyak and followed by the consistent service we definitely enjoyed our stay. All the happening locations like Patatoe Head and Ku De Ta are just a short walk away. \n\nThe hotel itself and the rooms have been very quiet. Considering interior guestroom and overall design of the hotel, the stay was worth every penny\n\nWe stayed at the four seasons before for a longer vacation, however need to stress that food and location have been much better at Luna (e.g. we had a 5 course dinner in Orbit which was absolutely delicious).",

After touring the island for a week, Luna2 was the perfect end to a girlfriend getaway.  The location is amazing, right by the beach, and so close to the restaurants and shopping streets.  But really, we didn\u2019t really want to leave the hotel.  Jonah and his staff treated us like movie stars!  They arranged manicures and massages by the pool (the coolest pool you\u2019ll find in Bali!), and catered to anything we needed.  We were just blown away from the moment we stepped inside.  And I should mention the food!  It was like we were in NYC or Vegas, the flavors and presentation were amazing.  We were the annoying tourists taking food pics\u2026 but we weren\u2019t the only ones!   It was by far our favorite hotel that we stayed at on our trip.",

You can walk up the beach to Ku De Ta and Potato Head within a couple of minutes.\nI never saw such a well-designed hotel before. They do offer very huge suits, designed in various ways (retro, chic, avant-garde, space-age,  pop art). In short, this seems to be unique in Bali. The\nservice was also amazing, very friendly and attentive.\nLuna2 offers a great restaurant (Orbit) as well as a rooftop bar. You'll also find huge pool in Mondrian-style (awesome!) with day-beds for all-day chill-out. Additionally, the hotel has its own cinema with very comfortable lounge seats.\nAlthough the price is not cheap you really get a lot for your money - Luna2 is worth it!",

I would normally never think to stay at a design hotel with two young kids, but it was like it was designed FOR kids\u2026 big kids too!  The colors were so bright, and the hotel is designed for nothing but FUN!  There\u2019s Monopoly, legos, and even Thunderbirds everywhere!  I felt like a kid too!   We loved the pool (you won\u2019t find anywhere with more pool toys!), but the highlight was definitely the movie theatre.  Thanks to the staff for watching the boys (a night of hot dogs and popcorn) while the hubby and I were able to escape for dinner.  \n\nThank you again, Luna2, we can\u2019t wait to come back and see everyone again!",

Our studio was really big, with incredibly quiet and efficient central air-conditioning system, lovely bathroom and beautiful views over the ocean and sunset. The balconies were enormous as well! We loved the breakfast and the staff was the most helpful we encountered anywhere in Bali. The only thing we did not like is that we only found this hotel at the very end of our 2-month stay in Bali: otherwise we would have probably spent our entire time here ;).",

              "text": "Luna2 is a great little boutique hotel with quirky 1970s retro decor.  The rooms are spacious and well appointed. The staff were exceptional - After the second day, they knew who we were on a name basis - possibly because there are only 14 rooms.  Even so, you still feel very welcomed and the staff provided interesting insights to Seminyak, without being too in your face.\nThe only thing stopping the 5 star rating was the location.  While it is very close to the beach, it is still a bit of a walk or taxi ride to the main shopping area and restaurants / bars in Seminyak (Seminyak Square).  There didn't seem to be a lot of taxis near the hotel either.\nTip - if you order a taxi to pick you up from the hotel, they charge a minimum 30 000 Rp fare regardless of how far you travel.  Taxis off the street charged between 10 000 and 15 000 to hotel from Seminyak Square",

If you are looking for holiday in centre of fun, in touch with many restaurants, bars, spas, shops etc., but would like to sleep and stay in quiet hotel, Luna2 is best place! We spent one month in hotel Luna2 and I can it highly recomment! Really family atmosphere, the most helpful \u201ccrew\u201d I\u2019ve ever seen. :-) The Hotel has only 14 rooms, to be alone in swimming pool area happend  to us very often. Sometimes felt like private area only for us. They save plastic trash with complimetary jug water. You can order massage in room or in front of swimming pool. I recomment it for sure, they have great, professional therapists. Wonderful sunset view from roof top bar which is also not busy, but very romantic area. Last but not least: lovely breakfast, choice from menu, individual wishes are grant, amazing fresh juices, smoothie bowls etc. We had breakfast included. They have also restaurant for lunch or dinner with huge choice of wine. Only a little complaint about the prices in the restaurant. Meals prices are higher than nearby restaurants (including hotel restaurants). But everything else was perfect!!! Enjoy your holiday in Luna2!",

Staff are superb, breakfasts are excellent (a-la-carte plus a selection of fruits, pastries and cereals) and the pool is terrific. One good thing about this place is that there are only about 14 rooms so that you should never have to wait for a breakfast table and loungers at poolside will always be available. A walk to the main \"pub street\" in this part of Seminyak (lots of Aussies like me around) is 10 minutes and the narrow street is well lit at night. Highly recommended if you like a modern setting. PS; their roof top bar is very good.",

I would\u2019ve rated 5 stars but it\u2019s located off of a street that\u2019s a bit difficult to navigate when walking. You can go to the beach and go left or right to get to the main areas.

We weren\u2019t sure whether we would relate well to this theme but we very quickly fell in love with this fun concept. It is so tastefully presented and kept in immaculate condition. Bali\u2019s tropical weather often results in rapid deterioration of even the most beautiful properties but with Luna2 the maintenance and cleanliness is outstanding. It truly is a hidden gem.\nUndoubtedly this is a five star rated hotel and has all the facilities you would expect. Plus more! We have stayed at exceptional hotel chains around the world including Four Seasons, Oberoi, Ritz Carltons - at none of them have we received a warmer, more personalised welcome. And the movie theatre was such a magnificent touch - a personalised screening of a recently released movie in the most amazingly comfortable surroundings. It was a lot of fun!\nOur room is spacious and very well equipped. Ocean views from the balcony as well as a direct outlook onto the pool.\nThe rooftop bar was a fabulous place to experience the sunset over the ocean.\nWe are lucky that we still have another couple of days before our holiday ends as it will be hard to return to the real world. We are already dreaming of returning with family and friends and maybe one day booking the whole hotel ( there are only 14 rooms). It would be the perfect place for a special birthday or small wedding.",

The staff are number 1 in being friendly and helpful, this is a small boutique hotel, only 14 rooms so it's very quiet and sometime we felt like we were the only ones staying there. (Although we weren't) food was great, the driver is a great touch, you can get dropped off any where in the local area, which is great as the hotel is down the end of a long lane and taxi can take a while. The movie theatre was also great, the staff even put a movie on request, if we didn't like the movies they were showing. We used the pool a couple of time, but it could get very hot out there as boxed in. We extended our room on the last day and the rate they charged us was very good, was lovely to not have to check out and wonder around for hours as we didn't leave for the airport till 7pm. Overall great stay. Thanks again to the great staff. ",

With only 14 apartments it was quite private and the staff were fantastic. Close to the beach and with a shuttle bus into the heart of Seminyak, the location was perfect. The in-house cinema was just like Gold Class and even had a call button to order food or drink! We even got to pick the movie. We picked to stay there on the basis of the reviews and believe all the great reviews were thoroughly deserved!",

Nevertheless, on behalf of the team, I would like to express my sincerest regret and apology for the inconvenience.\r\n\r\nI was most concern to read about your comment in regards to the refund process that was taking very long time. We have tried our best to always update you for this process and last time I personally have sent you the screenshot of the transaction made already from the bank. However, please allow me to take your comments with all its points and use it as learning exercise for our associates to ensure this will not happen again in the future.\r\n\r\nYour valuable feedback has been highlighted for our improvements on product and service standard. Through constructive feedback of this nature we are able to isolate the finer details in customer and guest satisfaction in order to focus our attention to constantly striving to exceed guest expectations.\r\n\r\nWe do hope we will have another chance to welcoming you at our hotel so that we are able to somehow restore your faith about Luna2.

Understand your reservation has been cancelled with fully refundable. We have informed directly to our partner to proceed the refund as we use their system for our website payment gateway. After that, they sent us some documents to be completed to do the refund. It was a bit delay also in processing the refund as there was some public holiday near that date. However, we also have let you know and updated the situation that it will take some time to be the money back to your credit card. I was personally helping to follow up to finance team and all related to complete the refund process.\n\nRegarding the exchange rate, it is fully out of our control as there might be differentiate between the two currencies every day and it has been a hotel procedure that we cannot take payment in different currency. So the money that was refunded might be different in your currency because it will be depending on the currency on that date.\n\nVenturer008, please allow me to take your comments with all its points and use it as training and learning exercise for us to ensure fine tuning is made in the future. I really appreciate your fair openness and constructive feedback.\n\nIn closing, we do hope we will have another chance to welcoming you at our hotel so that we are able to somehow restore your faith in this hotel and its associates. \n\nWith best regards\n\nDavid Oktariawan\nAssistant Front Office & Reservations Manager",

              "text": "Rooms: huge, really interestingly designed, lots of natural light, a lovely balcony where (at least on high floors) you can see the ocean, a big bath tub, and an ipod pre-loaded with a chilled retro-inspired soundtrack (such a great idea - now when I hear those songs I'm reminded of this hotel). My room wasn't perfectly maintained unfortunately - in my experience this is a frequent problem in design hotels (non-standard materials are non-standard because they're harder to maintain)\nService: fantastic, as is generally the case in Bali. I particularly loved the flexibility of the managers - I was travelling alone on a package meant for two people, they made lots of accommodations to allow me to enjoy all the inclusions\nPublic areas: lovely pool that I had to myself most of the time, awesome private cinema that unfortunately only showed something I wanted to see once during my 5 day stay (there's only one screening of non-kids movies each day, the movie is set by the staff - it'd be so much better if they let the first guest to inquire each day choose from a list of movies), beautifully designed lobby and restaurant, rooftop bar with fantastic sunset view over the ocean \nFood and drink: breakfast was wonderful (with my package, I got an a la carte dish from the extensive menu + fresh juice + tea or coffee + as much as I wanted from the small buffet!), lunch and dinner options were just okay, cocktails were tasty but weak\nLocation: On the pro side, the beach is only a few meters away. On the con side, this place is at the end of a long winding lane so it's difficult to walk into town even though it's not far as the crow flies, you can take a short-cut along the beach but you'll have to cross a creek which will result in your shoes getting saturated. But this isn't too big a problem, the hotel offers free drop off in town (\"if available\", it was always available without much delay when I wanted it) and after dinner good restaurants will find you a reliable bluebird taxi which will only cost $2 (if you try to hail a cab yourself, you'll probably end up with a driver that refuses to go anywhere for less than $5)\nValue: My 5-bubble review is based on the fantastic deal I got (200AUD/nt with inclusions valued at about 50AUD/nt, via Luxury Escapes), if I'd paid the generally available price (~225AUD/nt in shoulder season) I'd rate it 4 bubbles",

The apartments are full of fun surprises. We even had Salvador Dali\u2019s melting clock dripping off a shelf. Plus one service everywhere and a really delicious breakfast with extremely healthy options. Great rooftop bar and fabulous pool. A themed art hotel very much worth a visit !!",

              "text": "Very interesting hotel, unique style with lots of nice touches. We stayed here for 11 nights end August. It\u2019s about 5 minutes walk to the beach, and 10 minute walks to the main shopping and restaurant streets of Seminyak. The hotel is small with 14 rooms, a pool area, bar, restaurant and private cinema. There\u2019s a roof top bar but it shuts at 8.\n\nThe rooms are studios with large lounge/sleeping area, very comfy bed and a small kitchenette area and large shower/tub, as well as a large balcony. All decorated in 60\u2019s retro style. We had a good breakfast included, with a la carte dishes as well as small buffet. Very good food and personal service. Pool area is a bit grey (walls are grey!) and doesn\u2019t hit the sun all day, but the pool area was very quiet and they had buzzer service for drinks etc so nice to chill out there.\n\nHad lunch a few times and all food was good quality, staff very friendly and the cinema is a nice touch. \n\nSeminyak is a nice area, but the beach isn\u2019t great. What you get is a nice vibe, lots of good restaurants (local and lots of Aussie style places). Bits of the area are a bit shabby in Seminyak and the beach isn\u2019t great for swimming at all. We took a car to Sunday\u2019s Beach Club several days (1 hour) with white sand a crystal waters!) \n\nWe enjoyed our stay at Luna 2, and there has obviously been a lot of thought put into everything here, and the team are very kind. More fun than staying in a branded hotel but still good standard (AC, Wi-Fi both top quality). ",

The breakfast is on demand based on a well garnished menu and they even have a movie theatre inside the hotel. The only minor area for improvement could be the swim pool which is not always exposed to the sun but the beach is so close that it is not a problem.",

The hotel staff is nice and the room they moved us to is nice but overall, I would not stay here again.  The place has so much potential to be a great hotel, too bad they are not living up to it.",

A big shout out to Agus our driver who gave us fabulous service and really made our stay special.  In fact, all the staff are great!\n\nThe studio room was quiet, large, bright, modern and clean. It had a  large bathroom and shower, a good sized and comfortable balcony which we did use (as there was no sign of the mozis)\n\nThe pool was wonderful and relaxing and all poolside furniture was free to use.  The cinema was great with comfy seats and they provided blankets in case the airconditioning was to cold. They played 2 free movies a day which our son loved at night. \nThe restaurant food was good, we loved the breakfasts!\n\nThe beach was close, down a small alley, turn left and pull up a beanbag at one of the many restaurants along the beach to catch the sunset. Turn right and walk into town (approx. 15 minutes) or visit the Ku de ta Beachclub which is only a  5 minute walk.\n\nAfter we left this hotel, we spent the 2nd half of our holiday in a well known large hotel in another town in Bali, it was a big let-down and we compared everything with Luna2 and wished we stayed there longer.\n\nWe recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in a modern estabilishment and would like a quieter, more personal experience.",

Very British avant-garde designed around the style and theme's of the 1960's. Nice little restaurant with staff who were on the ball and a menu different to what you would normally find.

It was very unique in the sense that it was like we were on a different planet... the interior decor is very pop-mod but also retro at the same time, lots of bright colours and graphic elements. \nThe staff is very friendly and will cater to your every need, my friend and I were craving some pizzas one night and they were very quick to get us our yummy pizzas :) The breakfast buffet bar has various options from fruits to muffins to pastries which are really delicious. I did try their ala carte menu and ordered the croque monsieur which was amazing! The flavours balanced really well between the salty and savoury of the cheese and bechamel sauce and the sweet of the tomato relish... probably one of the best croque monsieur's that I've ever had! \nThe room is great, very spacious with a private kitchen and balcony and not to mention, a retro style TV which adds a very unique touch to the room. \nThe hotel has a massive shared pool, pool bar, rooftop, indoor movie theatre, laundry service and concierge services! \nI would highly recommend Luna2 as a home-away-from-home stay in the heart of Seminyak :)",

Everything from check in to check out was fantastic. \n\nI had originally booked another venue in Seminyak but was disappointed in the accommodations and ended up leaving. Needing to find a place at last minute I stumbled across Luna 2. From the moment of check in the staff greeted us with a smile and took our bags. The room was very large with a separate shower and tub which I love. The design was a retro modern look and the room came with a balcony that overlooked the large swimming pool. The room had everything you would want in it and the air conditioning worked great. Only thing I wish they had were blackout shades as the sun comes up early and bright. \n\nThe beach is just a few steps away from the property and to your left is a place on the beach where chairs and umbrella can be rented for a very reasonable price. It's a clean nice part of the beach. \n\nBreakfast is very good as well and provided with the room. \n\nThe pool has several areas for shade and has shallow parts and deep parts. In the morning one could easily do lap swimming while the afternoon is a prime time to chill and relax. No one else was even out there. They do have service to the pool. There's even a cool floatie. There's even a way to view the wine cellar from the pool under water. \n\nYou can't stay there without catching a sunset at the rooftop bar. Great cocktails and wonderful view. \n\nI didn't check out the cinema but it's really neat that they have one provided and daily showings with a children's movie followed by a movie for grown ups. \n\nThis area is quiet but it's about a 10-minute walk to busy part of town where there are plenty of restaurants and shops along with bars. \n\nBest of all you get five-star accommodations at a reasonable price. This is one of the best places I have ever stayed at and will truly be remembered for years to come. Anyone going to Bali and staying in Seminyak I would highly recommend to stay at this place.",

              "text": "For the past weeks I went to Bali with my friends (total 4 of us)and stayed in Luna2 Studiotel. This hotel isn't famous in most of the hotel booking website mostly because it is not a big hotel group like Hard Rork, Marriott...etc. The reason we get to know this Luna2 is thru an agency name Bleeps.\n\nThe most memorable about this hotel is the service they provided. I would not say is perfect however they did their level best and compare to others they have more value added services. Our booking includes airport transfer by a 7-8 seaters LunaMobile (I think this is the only vehicle they have for the guests). Luna2 does not have a big signboard or logo at the entrance, it looks a bit secretive.\n\nWhen we stepped into the lobby, the porter helps to carry our luggages and we are welcomed nicely by the staff. I like the smile of most of the staffs there. After all the check-in procedures we were lead to our rooms and they explained to us the facilities inside the room, then a welcome cocktail drinks with a chocolate is served.\n\nThe room is amazing! You can get more photos in their website and you get exactly what you see.  Each of the rooms has slight different design and the whole hotel is decorated like the board game - Monopoly.\n\nAs for free shuttle, as long as your destination is within the Seminyak area they will do the free transfer for you, otherwise you can ask them book a Blue Bird Taxi or Grab Car for you. Everytime when we saw the workers there especially the front counter staff, they will ask what is your program today? (not sure if they want to offer any tours for you or what) but they never be pushy. \n\nOne the same day night we check-in, when we back to hotel and my friends came to our room for drinking, we smell something weird in our room. That time is near to 12am. We searched every corner in the room but did not found any suspicious things, so we called to front counter and send someone to check on it. Their respond is very fast. within 10 mins they came and also smell something is weird. After 10mins searching the room they apologize that they unable to find the source of weird smell, so they offer us to move to another room. They give us 15mins to pack our stuffs then helped us to move to 1st floor, which next to my friend's room.\n\nThis room (Green, 1st floor) is abit dated compared to the the first room (Yellow, 3rd floor). However we appreciated so much their prompt action. On the next day when we  saw the staff at the lobby, they apologize again and explained the reason of the weird smell. They are really courtesy. \n\nBreakfast is continental style. Do not expect too much for its breakfast because the hotel only has 12 rooms, so breakfast selection is very limited. Our breakfast is included with a cup of tea/coffee and a glass of fruit juice. On the second day breakfast, we ordered from their menu. I would say the food they cook really awesome! I love the omelette with Truffle so much, and the price is not too much also! You can sit next to the pool and enjoy your breakfast under sunlight.\n\nTo the beach is only 5 mins walking distance. To main street is about 15 mins by walking. Just some tips for those who enjoying walking - If you walk up to North you will come to Seminyak Square Area which is very happening street with lots of good restaurants and bars, there is also 4 convenient shop along Marriott Hotel. Do use Google Map when you plan to walk around :)\n\nDo go to the roof top and sit on the bench facing the ocean, very relaxing!\n\nThere is some comments from my friend, in our room there is a coffee maker but we can't find any capsule. Also they did not provide slipper in the room. \n\nOverall Luna 2 is the best hotel I ever stayed for its service provided. You can really have a good rest here and maybe enjoyed sunbath beside the pool. Will definitely recommend to my friends especially couple to stay here when to plan to visit Bali (ya now I know why they call Luna 2, is for couple!!). Thank you very Luna 2 for the hospitality.

From my welcome cocktail to my private screening in their movie theatre (complete with fresh, buttered popcorn!) to my tasty breakfast in bed, everything was PERFECT! I was there on a rainy day, and were not able to enjoy the pool or beach, but there was more than enough to keep me busy at this hotel! My suite had a fully loaded iPod and Bose sound dock to set the tone for a relaxing night in! I enjoyed bespoke cocktails on Luna\u2019s rooftop with killer views of the Indian Ocean, followed by \u201cin-flight dining\u201d for dinner in my suite! I was served a gourmet meal on a quirky airplane tray that even came with personalized 1st class \u201cticket\u201d to the moon!  It was served retro flight attendant style, and the concept was really cool! And if I had ventured outside of the hotel during our stay I noticed that Luna2 would even pack a beach bag for me full of necessities and beach toys! What\u2019s more, every staff member went out of their way to come and chat with me on a personal level, which was a nice departure from Bali\u2019s typically very formal service standards. I wish I could have stayed longer at Luna2! Love this place!",

Everything you need was there. Massive bed, pillow menu, great bathroom and shower. \n\nFood...OMG utterly amazing. We could not believe our luck. Breakfast was delicious, best holandaise sauce I\u2019ve eaten. The Luna burger was to die for..and don\u2019t get me started on the cocktails and canap\u00e9s. \n\nStaff could not do enough for you. I felt they really took care of us and got to know us in comparison to many other Bali trips.\n\nThis is a hidden gem.  Thanks so much Luna2 ",

Our studio room were clean, very comfortable, tech-forward (with iPad & iPod) and fun. Breakfast with incredible flavours, combinations and presentation. What I love the most is the Lunaplex, which is a private cinema (with the best reclining seats) that is so comfortable where we had the opportunity to watch \"Justice League\" movie. Great location with short stroll to Seminyak beach. Best of all the staff were friendly, attentive and helpful at every step of our stay. Luna2 has restored my faith in luxurious Bali holidays and I would absolutely recommend this place...especially if you need privacy",

The room is extremely spacious and well designed. The ipod in the room is filled with great selection of music, and bathtub was big and perfect for a romantic bath, set with candles on the side. The bed and pillow selection was divine and we had such a great nights sleep everytime. The hotel is located 200m from the quiet part of the beach, and 4mins walk on the beach to the livelier parts of the beach. Staff and service is amazing, the people are extremely friendly. The roof top bar has an astounding selection of cocktails and a beautiful sunset view.Amazing stay!!!",

Everyone is super friendly and takes great effort in making their guests happy. They organised a table for us as well as transport to one of the clubs. The pools is awesome and from their rooftop terrace you have a great view to watch the sunset.\nLocation wise its reall good as well. Very close to the beach in the heart of seminyak. I highly recommend Luna 2 for your next visit to Bali.",

We didn\u2019t stay here but staff showed us around the hotel. It is beautiful with a real twist. Has a cinema and fun places to enjoy a cocktail or two! Not like all the other hotels with its setting. Private and quiet. Looked lovely and clean. Rooms are well laid out. Will definitely stay here on our next visit to Bali. ",

              "text": "Luna2 is a great boutique hotel, steps away from the beach. My partner and I stayed in the Studio suite and we didn't expect the room to be as big as it was! We received a complimentary pick up from the airport, cocktails and cute little chocolate on arrival and it felt as though we had the whole hotel to ourselves!\n\nThe Studio suites are great! There is a small kitchen with stovetop, sink and SMEG fridge. The circular couch in the lounging area is amazing and I want to get my hands on one asap! The bathroom was enormous, unfortunately we weren't there long enough to enjoy the bath but the shower and included amenities were fantastic. The iPad has all the info you need if you want to go out and about, the iPod mini is choc full of music, we would just hit play each time we got back to the room and enjoy whatever was shuffling. \n\nThe staff are amazing, Australian hotels could learn a thing or two about service from these people. They are attentive and friendly and never shy of a conversation. We also had a late check out so could enjoy a lay in. Included in the rate was breakfast which was great. Unfortunately for a vegan, there was only one or two things for me to eat but my partner loved it. I enjoyed a porridge with local, poached fruit (SO GOOD!) alongside their 'Red Dragon' juice (highly recommend.) As well as a main breakfast meal, you are also invited to the buffet where they provide small pastries, fruit, yoghurt, granola, toast etc. \n\nThe pool is awesome, super long and the perfect temperature for cooling off. The service buzzers alongside the sun lounges are rad, just punch the buzzer and one of their friendly staff are out in a flash to take your order. \n\nDefinitely recommend!!",

I have had some wonderful traditional Christmas lunches in England but the attention to detail by the New Zealand chef who cooked our lunch was amazing and she produced it in Bali!  I chose the classic turkey and plum pudding menu but this was much more than meat and two veg. Adding this to the unique Luna 2 surroundings and the impectable service in what felt like a private dining room - it was incredibly good value",

When arriving in the hotel, we are greeted by receptionist staff who was very friendly and attentive. We also were given Lunatini, their welcome drink. The hotel design is very funky and modern. I took picture a lot here. My kid also love the swimming pool which is very colorful and also the gravity.\n\nIf you're on holiday to forget your day to day stress and take in the beauty and positive vibes a hotel or a holiday has to offer then you will definitely get it here. Beach is just one minute walk from the hotel. The hotel is surrounded by great restaurants and shops. We also got to see nice sunset at their rooftop bar.",

They have rooftop bar named \u201cSpace\u201d and it has best sunset view.  They also have private cinema with VIP seat and big screen.

The friendliest staff and service provided are more than we could expected particularly by helpful front desk staff, cheerful restaurant waitress and cleaners(2 times room cleaning each day). We were welcome by cocktails and their unique chocolate which both are very nice. The hotel was stylish and have private cineplex, rooftop bar, swimming pool and etc. Their room was awesome equipped with kitchenette, dining area, sitting area, reading area and big bathroom. En-suited bathroom is fitted with shower room, bathtub with tv attached which u can enjoy movie while having bubbles bath as well. An iPad, iPod and coffee machine with complimentary capsule coffee are placed in each room. Last but not least, We love their daily breakfast so much so much. The breakfast was tasty and well presented by the chef. Once again, well done to luna2 and the team. ",

              "text": "This place is an absolute 'must-do' when visiting Bali. \nFor me, Luna2 was more than just a hotel, it was an experience and an amazing experience at that!\nEverywhere you look from the art on the walls to the dance floor that lights up like the scene from Stayin' Alive, every little detail has been thoroughly thought out. The theme runs throughout the entire hotel and I felt like a child in a candy store discovering what was around every corner!\nThe staff are wonderful, very friendly and super helpful and I felt like nothing was too big or to small to ask of them, if that wasn't enough they seemed to get a lot of delight out of any request, I felt like royalty - if only for the short time I was there!!\nFor me however, the real stand out was the food! It was on another level, the produce was fresh and the creative menu was simply inspiring and super delicious. I was lucky enough to meet the chef, Alanna who is clearly very passionate about her cuisine and it showed with yet again, every detail thought through - 'absolutely and utterly delicious'. We have come to expect good food from Bali these days but Chef Alanna takes it to a whole new level! \nI thoroughly recommend the Sunday Roast, yet another experience with the wagyu beef so tender it melts in your mouth, of course it is served with all the trimmings we want on our Sunday Roast but every single element is worthy of its own plate - and crown! Horseradish mouse, light and fluffy potatoes with a crunchy coat, cauliflower bake with a hint of blue cheese, oh my god I'm still tasting it on my tastebuds and I honestly and genuinely can not wait to go back to Bali for more!\nThanks Luna2 and all the your wonderful staff for an unforgettable experience!",

              "text": "We had an amazing time at Luna2. Our first time at Luna2 was 2 years ago and they have maintained the same standards since then. The hotel grounds are impeccably maintained and so clean. Something rare in beach resort destinations. The sand and dirt always gets tracked in somehow, but not here. It\u2019s spotless, including the pool. No dead leaves or insects swimming in there. \n\nWe hardly ever went out because it was so comfortable. They really thought of everything you would need for a comfortable stay. The design is unique and has so many clever touches. Example, the a/c automatically turns off when the balcony doors are open. Lunaplex - the private cinema is just so plush and luxurious. I didn\u2019t have time to watch a movie there but it looks really amazing. The restaurant served delicious food at reasonable prices. The breakfast each morning was perfect. You have the option of one hot breakfast and they are all good. They were so accommodating of our annoying food intolerances (dairy, gluten and egg free).\n\nA few improvements for a truly out of this world experience - \nDimmers that work. Lighting was too bright for night time. There were dimmer switches but they don\u2019t work. \nBlack-out curtains for guests who want to sleep in. It\u2019s actually the first place we stayed that doesn\u2019t have black out curtains. It would be helpful especially in Bali where the sunrises at 6am. \n\nMost importantly everyone there was so friendly and genuine. Thanks to all staff for the wonderful experience. So sorry I cant remember everyone\u2019s names. I will not list them here because I know I will miss someone out. But thank you all! You\u2019ve spoiled us and it will be difficult to find a another hotel of such standards - luxurious, high quality and yet so personal and genuinely friendly. It\u2019s a a combination of qualities very difficult to achieve. ",

The d\u00e9cor is total 60's with Mondrian themed pool, Monopoly corridors, Courege mini skirts dresses and gogo boots for the feminine staff.  All around great service, great breakfast included, and also great food served at the restaurant - loved the crab linguini!!! Rooftop bar/restaurant overlooking the ocean and the sunset is gorgeous. Only 14 rooms so this boutique hotel is very calm and perfect for a quiet vacation. If you are into the Kuta boom - boom, not really a place for you!! Would recommend to singles, couples and families alike who want a great place to enjoy Bali!",

While we sipped on a delicious 'Lunatini' welcome cocktail, Krisna at the front desk made sure we felt welcome and had all the information we needed for our stay.\n\nThe decor is amazing and you really feel like you have stepped out of Bali and back in time, but in a really glamorous way. The studio's are so well equipped you could easily stay a while, and are the perfect place to host a little party if you felt inclined. Luxe kitchen accessories including fully stocked SMEG fridge, Nespresso coffee machine and induction cooking. The kitchen supplies also include enough champagne glasses for friends to pop in for a drink.\n\nWe decided to head to the rooftop bar instead and took advantage of the happy hour cocktails with prime position on the beach for the sunset.\n\nTaking the advice of the Chef who stopped by to have a chat we decided to go for the 'Inflight Dining' for dinner. Basically room service but not basic at all. I wont spoil the surprise but definitely not to be missed. The quality of the food and speed of delivery was second to none. Topped off with deluxe bath (also with flatscreen TV), wine, super comfy bed and on demand movies we obviously had a fantastic night!\n\n** Additional things we loved\n- Breakfast menu (included healthy options) and fast delivery\n- Essentials mini bar in the bathroom included all the toiletries you might need, eye masks, razors, moisturiser, deodorant, eye drops etc.\n- Listening to the ocean on the large balcony\n- Ironing station and laundry service\n- The big fluffy white towels and lush bed linens \n- The huge pool and poolside facilities\n-The service!! We couldn't flaw any of the staff, unreal.",

And they were easily surpassed in every way!  From the staff (who were extremely helpful and friendly at every step of the stay) to the amazingly decorated and  designed rooms, to the vibe and feel of the entire place, we were constantly talking about how fantastic Luna2 is.  The food (breakfast must not be skipped!), the movie theatre (with reclining seats and popcorn), the pool, the roof deck - all added to the experience.  And location - just next to the beach and close to restaurants and nightlife (if desired) as well as more traditional Bali spots.  Summing it up, my son said at the end that its his favorite hotel in the world!",

              "text": "Luna 2 hotel has been an amazing, cosmic, whirlwind of an experience! Stepping off the plane into Denpasar airport can be chaotic at best with offers of all mode of transport being thrown at you by those trying to make some money out of exhausted tourists after a long journey. It was with relief that I was whisked away by the VIP airport transport service provided by Luna 2, this is a BIG recommendation after a long plane ride. \n\nThe hotel itself is very colourful and fun featuring some amazing pop art. Each room is a different colour and has all the necessities that one may need including a balcony overlooking the pool. It is in a well situated area in Seminyak with the beach a few hundred metres away and Seminyak Square being a 15 minute walk along the beach. Although it is not right in the centre I felt it to be quite nice to be able to come back to walk out of the hotel and onto a somewhat less busy part of the beach. The fact that the Studiotel only has 14 rooms make it feel a lot more personal than a normal hotel, for example all of the hotel employees knew my name on arrival which i thought was a nice touch. They also asked if I wanted my suitcase unpacked which is a service that a larger hotel may not provide. \n\nIn my opinion it would be a great hotel for those looking the get away from the large corporate hotels that have hundreds of guests coming and going, great for couples or a family as they have many entertainment options including their own cinema. I cannot provide my opinion on the food as I did not eat at the restaurant however it looked as they had all bases required with breakfast,lunch,dinner and an all day menu suited to the western palate. \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my stay here, thanks to all of the staff who made it so wonderful!",

I love the location as I can safely store my board here and surf while my wife and I enjoy the luxurious facilities of Luna 2. We love their 25 metre pool and their underground movie theatre where we regularly watched late release movies with excellent sound quality for free, while enjoying a meal and a beer. This place rocks! We were included in a rooftop bar promotion of Verve champagne, while watching the sunset over the waves. The breakfast here is long and sumptuous with interesting choices. Luna 2's Indonesian staff speak English well, are professional and ever friendly, patient and helpful. They can provide you with a free lift to where you want to be, if there is a vehicle available. Helmut is the food and beverage magician here and he is attentive, effervescent and so helpful. Jessica is the stylish front office manager who contacted us before our arrival to assist us with dinner & massage bookings, and anything else we needed pre arrival. Jessica provides 5 star service with knowledge, grace and good humour that makes staying at Luna 2 an outstanding holiday experience. Well done team, we will be back!",

It\u2019s great that you were able to enjoy the surf break right in front of Luna2. The break does depend on the time of year, so I was glad to see it was excellent during your visit.  I am also very happy that you were able to join us for the Veuve Clicquot sunset event as well as enjoy a film in Lunaplex. I will be sure to pass your feedback onto our entire team regarding your feedback on their professionalism, patience and helpfulness \u2013 after all our goal is to offer superstar service to all our guests, it looks like we achieved that.\nHelmut and I are grateful for your kind words and hope to see you back soon for another out of this world stay! \n \nBest wishes \n \nJessica Lee Cook\nFront Office Manager \n \n",

              "text": "This is now one of my favourite hotels anywhere! We stayed for 5 nights with our 6year old son, who was also very sad to leave - \"the bed is so nice and comfortable, I love the cinema. I will miss the 'boys' (he means the waiters).\"\nLuna2 is fun and sophisticated. It's a small boutique hotel with a light touch, but expertly run. The cocktail menu is outstanding - I drank so much more than I wanted to. The food was great without exception and everyone is very helpful and kind. We also liked the rooftop bar which has a great view to the beach. We love the design, but we are Star Trek fans and retro junkies. The rooms are large with ample storage and very well laid out.\nThe hotel has its own cinema - 3 shows a day, the one at 3:30pm is child friendly. We have been traveling in Asia for more than 20 years and live in the region which results in a limited interest in excursions. By 3 o'clock we were usually exhausted from running around with the 6 year old. Being able to sit down to an entertaining movie with popcorn (for him) and a martini (for me) was a real treat - it's like gold class, but better. \nWe arrived unusually unprepared, but the staff had plenty of great suggestions - where to go, eat, what to do generally. It's unobtrusive and charming full service.\nA warm thank you to Jessica and Helmut for taking care of us so well - we will come again and recommend the place to anyone who doesn't need a traditional villa with a private wading pool. I sort of feel I haven't come home from staying in a hotel, but from visiting friends with a very nice big house.",

Luna2 founder & designer  Melanie Hall will extremely happy to read your review also, as you say that you are \u2018retro-junkies\u2019 , which certainly means you are, as we say \u2018like-minded Lunatics\u2019! \r\n\r\nOn behalf of Helmut and I, as well as the entire team, we appreciate your feedback relating to our service, as we do aim to provide superstar service and hope to go above and beyond for all of our guests. That is certainly achieved when a guest comments that we give them the feeling that you weren\u2019t staying at a hotel but at a friend\u2019s home.

Excellent staff and management where nothing seems too hard in this other cosmic galaxy.  Breakky is free and fabulous, love those egg soldiers every morning - Aussies will know what I mean.  I've never seen every amenity available as I did in Luna2.  Located on the beach and close proximity to the usual suspects of Ku De Ta, Potato Head etc, plus shopping in Seminyak.  You can't go wrong here if uber cool with outstanding service and food is what you are after.",

We are so happy that you and many of our guests appreciate that Melanie Hall, Luna2 founder & designer founder has created a ultra-chic studiotel where everything from the uniforms, rooms and d\u00e9cor is inspired with nostalgic, futurism or fun. \r\nPlease come back and see us again soon, to enjoy more movies in Lunaplex cinema, sunset drinks at the rooftop bar, or catching rays at the 25m Mondrian-ic colour-blocked lap pool.\r\nThank you again, from all of us at Luna2. \r\n \r\nKind regards\r\n \r\nJessica Lee Cook\r\nFront Office Manager",

The entire Luna2 team, including Luna2 founder & designer Melanie Hall will be thrilled to learn your feedback referring to the design and atmosphere. I certainly agree, Space rooftop bar has one of the best and unique cocktail menus on the island, created by Luna2 F&B Manager Helmut Roessler.  With the ocean view, it makes for a perfect evening. Luna2 Executive Chef Errol Defoe will also be pleased to read about your comments regarding the Lunafood and being \u201con top of the game\u201d. \r\n \r\nMyself along with the Luna2 team already look forward to visiting us again.  \r\n\r\nKind Regards\r\n\r\nJessica Lee Cook\r\nFront Office Manager",

Special note from me for up coming guess, if you visited bali for first time which is need balinese decor, etc this is not for you, or you want a resort with beautiful landscape And garden also this is not your choice, & if u need sun bath bed beach front for you this is not ur choice this place is good choice for people who need intimate feel with the hotel and also for a person who not like crowded thing like mostly big hotel/ resort which is queuing from the start u checked in and for anything else during your stay. Perfect for family even they dont have kids club, just spoiled ur children in swim-pool all day. Or explore the beach which is only 5minute walk We will definitely will come back some day, thx to u guys at luna 2 studiotel",

It was great to host you and your family at Luna2 studiotel. \r\n\r\nI will be sure to pass your compliments to Helmut, our very talented Food & Beverage Manager, and to the culinary team regarding our extensive breakfast options. I will also let Ayu, our on-site kids coordinator, know that your kids enjoyed being spoiled in the pool all day. \r\n\r\nAs you mentioned we are not the typical Balinese concept hotel, however we do offer a 14 super-spacious studios, so all of our guests have a personal, exclusive feel when they stay with us. And many of our guests also enjoy the privacy and tranquility when lounging on the daybeds and sun loungers around our 25m outdoor pool. The beach only a 1-minute walk away, and as the sun beds directly outside Luna2 beachfront are sectioned and taken care by the local Balinese, we are more than happy for our front desk staff to reserve the beds on your behalf at a small rupiah cost. \r\n\r\nWe appreciate your feedback and look forward to welcoming you back to Luna2 one day. \r\n \r\nKind regards \r\n\r\nJessica Lee Cook\r\nFront Office Manager",

The girls thought they were in heaven - so did I later on that night!  \n\nWe met some amazing people lying by the pool on our oversized sun beds - one wall around the pool is completely covered in fabulous POPART!  \n\nI know I mentioned a bit before about the wonderful staff but I cannot sign off without mentioning in person Jess and Helmet, Jess being front office Manager and Helmet heads up food and beverage, I have tried hard to find something they cannot conquer, I have thrown everything at them and in true Luna2 style they make you feel like your request is just so simple and easy. Jess knows everywhere to shop, pamper yourself etc etc in Bali and Helmet can arrange any drink under the sun! I know all this is important but it was the impromptu genuine chats that make you feel so comfortable here I am going to miss you all!!  Thank you guys you made my holiday and I am going home feeling terribly relaxed! Carrie",

To add to our fun and relaxation they made some amazing meals for us also - including one impromptu dinner on the rooftop with sunset views that was perfect.  \n\nOur two boys were taken care of and cared for by Ayu like they were her own.  From taking them to the beach or playing Uno or looking after them while Mommy and Daddy went for a drink or a meal.  Ayu is a truly lovely person who made us all have a great time!\nHelmut seemed to be everywhere with a smile and checking all was well, while Dede (evening) and Arif (mornings) looked after us impeccably. \n\nThere were SO many \"little things\" that I will struggle to capture them all.\n- Easter egg hunt organised for the boys - they loved it\n- Canapes on the roof - perfect\n- Easter treats in the fridge - lovely surprise\n\nA real gem of a hotel that I can highly recommend and staff you will always remember.\nThanks\nShaun, Sally, William and Hamish.",

Amazing decor with minute attention to detail, from the monopoly board corridors and room names to the groovy and funky pop art inspired rooms.  Breakfast was divine, service faultless.  The private cinema with gold class chairs was amazing.  What can I say? But \"Luna2 are go!!\"",

It was a pleasure to look after you, and I will be sure to let the team know that you found their service to be \"flawless.\" January can tend to be a slower time in Bali, but with only 14 studios, we pride ourselves on delivering super-star, personalised service with every single guest, regardless of the number of guests in house.  I am very pleased to know that you enjoyed your time with us, including catching a movie in Lunaplex cinema.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to seeing you again at Luna2.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n\r\nJessica \r\n\r\nJessica Lee Cook | Front Office Manager | Luna2",

All the iconic objects are there, the place is glossy and beautiful, and the good surprise is that below the image lives a very cosy, nice place, thanks to a fantastic crew that do all they can to make you happy. The food is great, the pool very relaxing, the cinema gorgeous, and the rooms just stunning.\n\nA brilliant concept with a heart, after 10+ trips to Bali I think this is it , the place I want to be. Oh and the wave is 50 meters away. ",

              "text": "I had a 2 day stay at Luna2 Studiotel my first time in Bali. The previous reviews on trip advisor helped me select this location. I loved the style which reminded me of Austin Powers and since this was the last leg of my vacation- I wanted something unique and private near the ocean. Everyone was friendly and helpful. My bank decided to cancel my payment because they thought it was an out of state purchase and the staff handled it beautifully and did not give up my reservation. They contacted me and since I was traveling with limited web access, they were patient and understanding. \n\nUpon my arrival, I was greeted by the GM Jonah and several staff who were all very welcoming, champagne, chocolate (my first sweets in weeks!), and a cold towel to freshen up. It was late and I didn't want to figure out Seminyak at 9pm so I ordered the fettuccini alfredo with black truffle oil- which was amazing melt in your mouth deliciousness-definately recommend it to everyone. Bali is not known for its Italian food so I was taking a risk ordering it but I am extremely glad I did. \n\nThe rooms are AMAZING! If you love art, decor, design, luxury, and style- this is the place for you. The images online are spot on. You will find pop art, monopoly art, artsy and modern furniture and accessories. Luna2 studiotel is fun and unique-haven't seen anything like it anywhere else in Bali or many other places I have traveled to. I stayed in Bond on Three and my decorations were all green- including the round sofa, lights, bath decorations etc. Love it- and it looked over the pool and a temple. \n\nIt was very private- i saw maybe one other couple during my two days. All the staff were super friendly and would hold great conversations with me while I waited for transportation. I even found out that their IT guy was an amazing photographer. I walked to the beach and to the stores solo during the time I was there and felt safe. \n\nMy flight was at midnight and since I had checked out they were very accomodating and allowed me to freshen up before my flight. I loved that they provided wifi/ipad/ipod for music, etc. In summary-it was a great experience and I would absolutely recommend Luna2studiotel to everyone I know. \n\nAll photos posted are spot on so I wont post mine. \n\nThe only thing I was not comfortable with- which was out of their control- was that the temple had a ceremony one of the nights and they were chanting and playing music for a while. At first I was excited to see this cultural side but after a while it was a bit much. I just closed the balcony glass doors and the problem was solved. Just FYI.",

              "text": "Bali is not just an Island Paradise anymore. On the world's stage it now represents the sleekest resorts, world class restaurants and cutting edge design stores of both fashion and lifestyle.\nLuna2 Studiotel will be attractive to the discerning design aficionado looking to be truly pampered in the most convenient location. The 14 room boutique hotel sits tucked just behind the Luna2 Private Villa on Seminyak Beach with direct access to the water via a short path.\nThe Studiotel is an oasis rarely found within the highly desirable Seminyak area. The boutique hotel and its rooms would make any Wallpaper devotee feel right at home amongst the James Bond/Andy Warhol vibe that the architecture and interior design have created out of a Monopoly board. The in house technology and hotel room comfort is outstanding leaving nothing out!  Hotel cleanliness is a high priority for me and Luna2 is unparalleled in this area.The in house food is delicious and fresh.  The scrambled eggs are the best I've had anywhere in Bali. \n\nWe have been staying in Bali for 10 years and a variety of resorts and villas however this place is a standout and it seems to leave you feeling like it's a combination of a private villa and hotel.\nOur children are 8 and 9 and enjoyed their time there so much.  Their mornings were spent around the pool and down at the beach. In the early afternoons before the children went back out to the beach they were beside themselves with excitement as they watched movies with popcorn in hand in a seriously impressive and super comfortable cinema on site.  The level of service was seamlessly high. Ayu, (who the hotel provided to help with our children) was especially sent from God!  Luna2 guaranteed my husband and I a holiday!\n\nKu De Ta is a 5 minute walk up the beach passed the Oberoi and the evening walk never fails to\ndisappoint. I walked most days up and down the stretch of beach early morning and was always welcomed back to the hotel with a cold towel and glass of water.\nLuna2 are completely up to speed with all the best shopping destinations and restaurants and can get you in anywhere even in peak season!\nIn all, our time at Luna2 was fun to be in such a unique setting and I would recommend it to both couples and families alike. On first glance it looks too 'cool for school' and that  may put those with children off but from our experience this is absolutely not the case.",

The kids absolutely loved the private cinema with comfiest seats we've ever known. The food was outstanding throughout, as were the friendly and super-efficient staff. The kids co-ordinater was superb and no task was too much day or night - our kids were spoilt rotten! The rooms and general decor were amazing with Lego meets Star Trek meets Thunderbirds meets James Bond meets Monopoly to liven things up in every corner of the hotel. Beach was just 50m walk for some great surfing fun. Loved it!",

They really have nailed the design, it's unlike any hotel I've ever seen and it's perfectly located on the beach in Seminyak, close to all of the hot bars, restaurants and hotels.  From the moment we arrived, when we were greeted by 6 staff and handed a glass of champagne and canap\u00e9s, our time at Luna2 was perfect.\n\nThe rooms are next-level cool with every gadget you could possibly want - multiple TVs, iPod Dock and iPod complete with a library of funky tunes, huge bathrooms and comfy beds.\n\nThe staff are ultra-friendly and all remembered our names with a huge smile and were always willing to go out of their way to make sure we had a great stay.  We had several recommendations for places to go to for breakfast, lunch, dinner and drinking and they were spot on with every one - it's great to have staff that are in tune with the 'places to be' in Bali.\n\nThe private nightclub 'POP!' downstairs is great fun if you're there with a group, with the staff happy to open it up for you and play your music through their huge soundsystem.  You can also chill out in your private movie cinema and watch a movie of your choice!\n\nThe poolside area is fantastic as well, we had it to ourself the entire stay.\n\nAll in all, it was a perfect stay!  With only 14 rooms at the hotel, the level of service is next level with the number of staff always outnumbering guests.  You can't go wrong by staying there.",

I stayed here for a weekend getaway and I feel like a rock star! They have the most creative interior design in Bali, pop culture, edgy and ubber cool concept. I love every single details of their amenities, from the room to the art wall, graphic design, to the Monopoly corridors and Legos are mind blowing. They also have a private cinema, amazing isn't it?. Their color is everywhere, which is cool. It\u2019s my summer pop in Bali. Service are amazing, they have friendly staff and very attentive to details. \n\nMy favorite lunch is Fish and Chips, their presentation is great, and fish is tasty, decent portion, crunchy French fries, appealing ingredients. I recommend you to try their lunch. Oh.. not to forget about their in room dining \u2013 as they called IN FLIGHT DINING, you\u2019ll be surprised how creative this menu served exactly the same lay out and presentation like what you get in flight but even better! \n\nI am looking so forward to experiencing Luna2 Studio again! Never miss the season in Bali, especially during midyear with lots of festival (music, food, etc) on the island. Thank you Luna2 Studio and team for your personal creative touch, it was an amazing experience.",

Hip interiors,  friendly staff, every amenity you could want from movie cinema and rooftop bar to a delicious restaurant and a lap pool to die for. Central location in Seminyak near all the nightlife and close to the beach also makes this a winner. My two nights there were not enough. I will be back!Only next time, I think I will spring for the adjacent Luna 2 Private Hotel which is right on the water. I am now a self-confessed \"Luna-tic\" and proud of it!",

Being a smaller  property it was ideal for our small group .. Being the Grand Father I did not have to go to the beach as I had the pool area & staff service to enjoy .. The family enjoyed the beach only a very short distance away .. Yes location excellent . The availability of a driver & car was used a number of times . The best experience was when we used the Luna 2 car for a trip to Ubud. We were able to have a special Sun set dinner on the top of the Studies that they referred to as space . The staff were always keen to assist .. Will be going back .",

As a business hotel it is terrific, everything works and it's easy to get swiftly through breakfast and jump in a cab. The rooms are great to work in and the wifi works perfectly. The rooms are wacky - no pastel shades on view. My son thinks this is the coolest hotel on the planet, and the cinema is terrific. Meanwhile we took advantage of the many bars in the Hotel and sampled some great continental food. The beach is only 100m away and it's a nice area, busy enough to be interesting, but not over-run and not far from the Seminyak beach bars. It's not your stereotypical laid back Bali holiday destination, but it's sure great fun.",

You don't have to leave the hotel with an amazing wine collection, Pop! An exclusive club and the cinema in the complex we had a fabulous time.  The food was also amazing and  Alanna, the Executive Sous Chef was great at catering for exactly what we wanted.  Highly recommend it and I definitely come back for the 5 star treatment",

Eclectic art greets you in the lobby together with an earthbound friendly welcome from the staff.\n\nMy room was large - and the bathroom huge by most hotel standards. There was a glass wall by the bath overlooking the room but the loo and shower had their own doors.\n\nThe bed was large and comfortable but the ceiling mirror over the right hand bottom of the bed led to a certain amount of speculation.\n\nTelevisions everywhere - huge opposite the bed - smaller above the bath and one with headphones for anyone wanting to watch an alternative movie.\n\nAll the other gadgets too - I- pad etc. - i didn't have time to play with them all. A retro fridge with a very well stocked minibar. Fast internet included and plenty of work space. My room - blue themed- overlooked the pool as all but one suite on the top floor do.\n\nThe roof top bar with its view over the sea is a must for sundowner cocktails and the sunset view is quite fantastic.\n\nLater on its the basement bar with the viewing room next door that is the attraction. A huge screen for movies and very comfortable recliner seats - children loved the supply of pop corn!\n\nIts an intimate but refined area and the staff aren't slow to notice an empty glass. Even if you go out to supper elsewhere this is a fun place to finish off the evening.\n\nThe walk to the beach is a couple of hundred metres down a private gang - past the Luna 2 private hotel to miles of sandy beach and rolling waves. Go for a walk down the beach early in the morning - its empty apart from some early morning joggers and a few people on horseback exercising their horses in the shallow water. Return to a delicious cooked breakfast in the dining room together with faxed copies of the UK papers - bliss if the Jakarta Post is the only alternative.\n\nIf you seek the Bali of Eat, Pray, Love this may not be for you - if you want comfort, attention to detail and pampering it is - and it works wonderfully for children too.",

But that would be boring anyhow, right?\n\nDid you know that the staff literally can read your mind? Starting from the security team to the receptionist via the kitchen staff and management team. \n\nDid you know that if you are looking for Bali furniture the reception team provides you with the intelligence for various nice places to go...\n\nDid you know that the chef(s) actually care about your likes and dislikes and while asking for same in the very beginning they afterwards try to match same. In our case fantastic meals matching exactly the needs of two hungry girls for - inter alia - basic pasta and some fresh veggies while their parents were looking for a more distinguished variable but still basic and healthy food experience. \n\nDid you know that the pool has underwater music playing?\n\nDid you know that the staff even organizes some coconut milk for you at very inhuman hours if you would suffer some stomach problems?\n\nDid you know that the private movie theater experience really is one of a kind? Forget about Singaporean Golden Village Business Class. I must assume that neither LeBron James nor any other Hollywood VIP does have a nicer private movie Theater at their premises...\n\nDid you know that the location is within 2-3 minutes foot walking to the sea?\n\nDid you know that compared to other high end places this one is not lacking of kindness and heartiness while providing you with high privacy and discretion.\n\nDid you know that I would consider Luna2 NOT to be first choice for a family with toddlers or below? I would say it is rather a place for couples, groups or families with kids at age 8 or above... But still, our two girls felt very comfortable at all time. The staff was very kids friendly and there were all kinds of kids entertainment stuff like games or so available.\n\nDid you know that the view from the roof top bar is amazing?\n\nDid you know that the bar tender puts some cucumber and pepper in your Hendricks Gin and Tonic?\n\nDid you know that we will return next week...?",

The setup, style location and staff at Luna2 make this a unique experience and we loved the beach front location, food and details such as the I-pad in the room and the private cinema (with the best reclining seats!). But the thing that makes this place really special are the people that run it, from the security on the door to the reception and kitchen staff, everyone went out of their way to make our stay perfect. From helping us plan our visit to the Gilly Islands to rescheduling a movie for us to watch in the cinema, to helping us search for a pair of lost glasses, the staff made an incredible effort throughout our visit. This may not be a traditional Bali hotel but the service alone is truly world class.",

If you want a traditional Balinese welcome/atmosphere, then this is not the place for you. But if you want a cool, funky place to stay in the heart of Bali's top end social scene, then you should not look elsewhere.\n\nFrom the Lego-meets-Monopoly-meets-retro decor, to the facilities offered and level of service, everything was of the highest order. It was wonderful to have a decent-length pool (complete with underwater music!), the children could have disappeared for life into the cinema and both the basement and roof-top bars were great. \n\nThere were original, creative cocktails that were to die for and while the menu was not super-extensive, the quality of the food was excellent - I'll take quality over quantity any day.\n\nThe bed was comfortable, the amenities offered in the room (sunblock etc) were carefully thought out and the fact there were three TVs was appreciated by the whole family.\n\nIn short, it's going to be tricky to convince the family to stay anywhere else on the Island of the Gods.",

Luna2 boasts bucketfuls of retro d\u00e9cor and nostalgic tweaks teamed with professional, five star hospitality services, making Luna2 a paradise for any jet-setting design-junky.  The friendly but discreet service at Luna2 studios encourages you to sit back and relax, with the overwhelming feeling that no demand is too big. After following the Monopoly board-inspired hallway to my room, I was thrilled to see bedrooms of an equally quirky caliber with bold colours and patterns creating lively, fun-filled pads with all the comforts and gadgets you could possibly require. The culinary expertise available at Luna2 studios was made apparent from the very first sunset canap\u00e9. The head chef, Brenden, introduced himself to our table and consistently blew me away with a delicate yet daring menu. Later we indulged in passion fruit and vanilla martinis in Pop! the underground disco den with all the cool and exclusivity of any London club but with a funky Luna2 spin. The hotel is impeccably well-kept and the playful touches are a constant surprise! I would recommend Luna2 studios to anyone.",

The colourful decor is original and seems inspired by a mix of Lego, Monopoly and Dutch painter Piet Mondrian. The level of detail in the furnishings is impressive throughout the hotel, as is the level of service.\n\nThe food is delicious and well presented - I was lucky to try a selection of small dishes including fish and chips wrapper in small newspaper cones and wagyu burgers. The ingredients were evidently of a high quality.\n\nThe bedrooms are also cleverly designed with many bright colours and original touches such as an additional retro-style TV. The fridge contents are definitely more comprehensive than most other hotels, as is the selection of toiletries.  \n\nI was pleasantly surprised to find a cinema room with an excellent acoustic system and very comfortable reclinable sofas with extendable footrests. The hotel also boasts a cool little bar/club with a good selection of premium spirits and  enough space for some dancing, if you're in the mood. \n\nIf you are looking for a fun, funky and stylish hotel, unlike any other in Bali, which still maintains a high level of quality and service, I would thoroughly recommend the Luna2 suites hotel. I really look forward to coming back.",

Luna2 does justice to the trendy Seminyak vibe. Highlights are is the trippy art, attention to detail and quality products and service. Why can't hotel chains be this cool? Love it and will be back.",

El hotel es muy moderno, nuestra pieza ten\u00eda un ipad con muy buena m\u00fasica y con atracciones cerca del lugar, adem\u00e1s de una buena cafetera, minibar con productos originales, entre otras cosas, y la decoraci\u00f3n es original. La ubicaci\u00f3n es buena, queda a 5 minutos caminando de la playa y muy cerca del pueblo en taxi o moto. Lo que m\u00e1s nos gust\u00f3 fue el desayuno (eleg\u00ed un huevo pochado con salm\u00f3n ahumado que estaba buen\u00edsimo) y la sala de cine para ver pel\u00edculas (los asientos son reclinables y nos llevaron cabritas).",

I am thrilled to hear you loved it and that you found all of our staff welcoming and friendly upon arrival and throughout your stay.  We are happy to provide all of our guests with \u2018mod cons\u2019 in the studios, and Luna2 founder & designer Melanie Hall will be pleased to know that you appreciated her ultra-modern design.

Ontbijt was top en zeer uitgebreid. Diner waren de recensies goed over, maar miste ik de gezelligheid. De ligging is top aan het strand en op loopafstand van veel andere leuke bars en restaurants. \n\nEchte aanrader dus!",

Le staff est adorable, toujours \u00e0 notre disposition, le manager est super gentil et nous a offert des cadeaux lors d'un diner fabuleux. Les chambres sont spacieuses, la musique est incroyable et le design est irr\u00e9aliste. Tout est orient\u00e9 vers les ann\u00e9es 70, jusqu'\u00e0 la tenue des serveuses. \nNous avons pass\u00e9 un moment magique, repli de rire et de bonne humeur. C'est agr\u00e9able apr\u00e8s une journ\u00e9e charg\u00e9e dans Bali de se poser dans cet h\u00f4tel et de se sentir chez soi, pr\u00e8s d'un bon film ou en dinant a cote de la piscine. Le coucher de soleil vu de la terrasse a tout son charme, surtout avec un cocktail et des petits fours a disposition. \nJe le conseille vraiment, c'est une exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 faire au moins une fois dans sa vie. Ayant \u00e9norm\u00e9ment voyag\u00e9, je n'ai jamais vu un autre endroit comme cela au monde.\n\nThank you Luna2 for everything, \n\nCharlotte",

Following your review, we would like to thank you for your time since our guests' perspective is of the utmost importance to us. Your constructive feedback is valuable for our team as well as for readers and visitors from all around the world.\r\n\r\nIt is with deep disappointment that I read your comments about your studio transfer.  As we only have 14 studios and this is high season in Bali, I am sorry we were not able to accommodate your colour preference in the same room category immediately.  Had we known of your dislike of yellow prior to arrival, we would have done our best to accommodate you in one of our other two grand studios. Our team did accommodate your request as soon as a grand studio in a different colour was available.\r\n \r\nAnd while Luna2 is a short stroll down the beach to Seminyak\u2019s best bars and restaurants, the main shopping district of Seminyak is only a short drive away.  We are 2 minutes away from the famous Ku De Ta. Whenever possible, we are happy to arrange transportation either in a Lunamobile or taxi.  It is with regret that there was a misunderstanding regarding your bike rental, but our Front of House Manager did her best to accommodate you, even in so far as to offer you her own motorbike for use.  The local and outsourced supplier unfortunately was late and we are pleased you were able to find alternatives so quickly as informed to me before your departure.\r\n \r\nIn regards to your compensation, I personally waived your additional expenses as well as offering you a complimentary night to truly experience Luna2 again on your return to Seminyak. \r\n \r\nThank you once again for sharing your point of view with our readers.  I am personally sorry we were not able to please you entirely.  My team and I continue to work hard to please every Luna2 guest. \r\n \r\nShould you decide to give us a second opportunity to make a first impression, I am confident we would be able to provide you a truly wonderful Luna2 experience. Please feel free to contact me personally at +62 361 730 402 for any queries as I am happy to assist.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention and we look forward to continue attracting more guests to Luna2 and the Island of Gods.\r\n\r\nWith Kind Regards \r\nJonah Roberman | General Manager | Luna2",

              "text": "Par o\u00f9 commencer ?\n\nNous avons pass\u00e9 2 fabuleuses journ\u00e9es \u00e0 Luna2 Studiotel, et cela restera un de nos meilleurs moments de notre s\u00e9jour \u00e0 Bali, sinon le meilleur. Nous partageons les avis de tous ceux qui l'ont class\u00e9 \"excellent\", c'est \u00e0 dire l'immense majorit\u00e9, tous, sauf un !\n\nJ'ai organis\u00e9 ce s\u00e9jour au Luna2 comme une surprise de derni\u00e8re minute pour notre f\u00eate, le 10 ao\u00fbt, et ma femme n'en croyait pas ses yeux, moi non plus d'ailleurs ! Notre fils a ador\u00e9 lui aussi ; l'endroit est g\u00e9nial car il a de quoi combler autant les amoureux (avec ou sans enfants) que les enfants, par son design ludique et original, ses diff\u00e9rents \u00e9quipements et services aussi bien en chambre (nous confirmons : tr\u00e8s bonne playlist dans l'iPod install\u00e9) que dans les espaces communs (nous avons b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d'une projection priv\u00e9e dans le super cin\u00e9ma, organis\u00e9e \u00e0 notre demande, pour visionner un film en fran\u00e7ais de notre vid\u00e9oth\u00e8que : un conseil, emmenez un film en HD/blueray, l'\u00e9cran est vraiment g\u00e9ant, tout comme la sono, sans parler du confort des fauteuils...) et sa situation parfaite \u00e0 2 pas de la plage au bout d'une rue tr\u00e8s calme (en impasse), et tout pr\u00e8s des \"hot spots\" de Seminyak (dont le Ku De Ta, \u00e0 moins de 5 min par la plage, o\u00f9 l'on a pu passer une soir\u00e9e en amoureux et en toute tranquillit\u00e9 gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 Ayu, formidable baby-sitter, que le Luna2 nous a mis gracieusement \u00e0 disposition).\n\nIl faut ajouter que le service est ultra-performant, professionnel, amical, sans jamais \u00eatre pesant.\nEn effet, un tel staff pour seulement 14 chambres range vraiment cet \u00e9tablissement dans le top niveau du service, en donnant la sensation d'\u00eatre un privil\u00e9gi\u00e9, et aussi d'\u00eatre quasiment dans une villa priv\u00e9e : nous avions r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement la piscine pour nous seul, le roof bar \u00e9galement, pour siroter un tr\u00e8s bon cocktail face au soleil couchant et en toute tranquillit\u00e9, idem pour le d\u00eener que nous avons pris pr\u00e8s de la piscine : on se croyait vraiment \"chez nous\" (\u00e7a fait du bien apr\u00e8s l'agitation du dehors).\n\nCarolina, la manager, nous a par ailleurs grandement aid\u00e9 dans notre qu\u00eate d'une dance party \u00e0 la hauteur de nos attentes.\n\nEn outre, nous avons b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d'un tarif avantageux, sans quoi nous n'aurions pu nous offrir un tel \u00e9tablissement, \u00e9tant habitu\u00e9s \u00e0 un standard bien plus modeste. C'est d'ailleurs ce qui en fait un souvenir exceptionnel ! C'est juste un peu dommage que pour le 1er petit d\u00e9jeuner, la r\u00e9ceptionniste nous ait dit qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas inclus au tarif, contrairement \u00e0 ce qui nous avait \u00e9t\u00e9 annonc\u00e9 pr\u00e9alablement, avant de rectifier cela, apr\u00e8s qu'on l'ait consomm\u00e9. En effet, nous nous sommes un peu restreint en ne choisissant que le continental, d\u00e9j\u00e0 fort bon, et j'ai pu constater le 2\u00e8me jour que les plats qui le compl\u00e8te, dans la formule \"am\u00e9rican breakfast\", sont tout simplement somptueux (j'ai test\u00e9 les \"\u0153ufs florentine\", un vrai r\u00e9gal).\n\nQue dire pour nuancer un peu ces propos dithyrambiques et les rendre plus cr\u00e9dibles ?\nDes rideaux plus occultants pourraient satisfaire ceux qui, comme nous, appr\u00e9cie le noir complet pour dormir. Nous sommes souvent confront\u00e9 \u00e0 cela et disposons de masques. De m\u00eame, la climatisation nous semble un peu bruyante, mais nous pr\u00e9f\u00e9rons dormir sans quoiqu'il en soit... donc rien de bien grave.\n\nBref, le seul vrai probl\u00e8me \u00e0 signaler, c'est que notre s\u00e9jour n'\u00e9tait que de 2 jours... On aurait bien continuer \u00e0 vivre dans ce luxe une semaine de plus, jusqu'\u00e0 notre d\u00e9part !\n\nPour conclure, notre r\u00eave serait de louer tout l'hotel avec des amis, un jour, pour y f\u00eater un \u00e9v\u00e9nement, par exemple un gros anniversaire : ce serait tout simplement g\u00e9nial !",

Das Restaurant orbit mit kleiner Auswahl aber daf\u00fcr besonders passionierter K\u00fcche ist wenig bekannt aber sicher eines der besten 5 auf der Insel. Sch\u00f6ner Kontrast zu Strand, Sonne, Tempeln und Yoga - das eigene Kino mit traumhaft bequemen Liegesesseln - und wieder einem perfekt freundlichen und aufmerksamen Service. Wer mit Freunden kommt kann im hauseigenen Privat-Club feiern.",

La chambre de ,modeste proportion est digne d'un h\u00f4tel de province  qui aurait rafistole un vieux d\u00e9cor, avec son design r\u00e9tro pop, et ses couleurs flashies d'un autre temps, De plus les chambres donnent pour ainsi dire sur la rue et ne sont isol\u00e9es que par une fine plaque de plexiglas  qui laisse passer tous les bruits de la circulation. On voit bien ce qu'a voulu faire le d\u00e9corateur, un pastiche des ann\u00e9es 70 avec des couleurs criardes et des references  au peintre Roy Lichtenstein, mais vient on a Bali pour cela? Pour s'enfermer dans une salle de projection pour voir des films, nager dans une piscine commune, sans la moindre v\u00e9g\u00e9tation ni charme, Je ne le pense pas et je ne saurais recommander cet endroit \u00e9trange qu'a des nostalgiques  des seventies qui n'aiment ni Bali ni la nature,",
