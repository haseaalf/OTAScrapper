              "text": "I have finally time to write this long overdue review for the Villas Tejakula. I've stayed at the villas twice, once in September 2017 and the last time in April 2019. Both times I've had an amazing holiday at the resort. I have stayed in a lot of different hotels all over the world and I am currently studying hospitality management, so I do have some experience regarding hotels (professionally and personally). The villas are definitely one of the best resorts I've ever stayed in. The reason the villas are so exceptional is not the  delicious food or the beautiful surroundings (which are both awesome nevertheless). What differentiates the villas from other hotels is their exceptional attitude and service. The whole stay is on an extremely personal level, the staff and managers are so welcoming and you feel right at home. The number one aim of everyone is for their guests to have an amazing stay and not to make as much profit as possible. Their guests are their number one priority, which is very rare nowadays. For example Wayan stops by at dinner to chat with her guests and connects different people with each other, especially when you are a solo traveller. Budi is very helpful when you want to book follow-up trips and will get you discounts. They have really become friends to me and I am really looking forward to returning to Bali and the villas in the future! \nOther than that Tejakula is truly a beautiful place on its own. I really loved that it is not so busy and touristy than Kuta and other places in Bali. When you are walking around on the street people will greet you and talk to you (wishing you a good day, not trying to sell you a Bintang shirt). It is a truly special place.\nYou can read a lot about the infrastructure, hardware and look at pictures of the hotel online. But what pictures won't tell you is the atmosphere and the interpersonal connections you can build here. Many hotels have a five star interior, but lack focusing on their guests. The staff at the villas will do anything to make your stay as memorable as possible.So I highly recommend this place!\nAll the best to Wayan and Budi and the rest of the staff, I hope to see you soon!\nNora from Germany",

The Villas environment is perfect for a feel of private yet invited, with beautiful calm surroundings and a wonderful local touch. Just 25m swim out from the shore of the hotel are the most beautiful coral and sea life to explore, with snorkel gear provided by the Villas. The food was so delicious, with fresh catch of the day a must when you visit! The staff were so warm and friendly, making us feel most welcome from the minute we stepped through the gates (we arrived later than expected, into the evening, and they graciously stayed up to wait for our arrival). Thank you to Wayan, Budi, Iluh and all the staff for an unforgettable stay at The Villas Tejakula.",

We really felt we'd found a little oasis: our own pool, superior separate rooms, dining area, kitchen and plenty of sunshine traps to relax in. A plentiful supply of drinks from our own fridge freezer too so that we could laze around the pool without having to venture too far for a drink. \n\nHowever a short hop to their open air restaurant area provided exceptional meals - breakfast, midday and evening meals available. Service always with a super smile, everybody that works with Budi and Wayan are soooooo lovely. Views across the sea to die for whilst enjoy food and drink. \n\nTrips/taxi service can be organised by Wayan and Budi will at times drive you. We took excursions to the scuba diving - 20 minutes up the road and went on the dolphin watching trip (an early morning start, and well worth the effort). \n\nWe really can't thank Budi and Wayan enough for giving us such a super break. I definitely recommend a stay there if you want to get away from a busy busy life - you'll be rejuvinated. \n\nI mustn't forget that you can also get a massage too whilst there. Our daughter really felt the benefits of a deep massage. \n",

              "text": "We had a lovely stay at The Villas Tejakula. It is even more beautiful than the pictures! The villas are setup with two private king rooms separated by a beautiful outdoor common area and kitchen with a shared pool. We booked one king room, but no one was staying in the other room so we had an entire villa to ourselves with our own private pool. It was just beautiful. The rooms are gorgeous and the staff have thought of every detail. The kitchen is stocked with coffee, tea, wine, beer, and sodas. Beach towels are provided, and there is mosquito spray in the rooms, although we rarely needed it, there were very few mosquitoes during our stay. \nThe lodge is located on the northern coast, which is quiet, not very touristy, and perfect for a relaxing getaway. Wayan emailed us after we made our reservations to provide us with a lot of helpful information. It is roughly a 3 hour drive from the airport, but Wayan and her husband Budi helped us organize tours of Lake Beratan and Ubud on our trips to and from the airport, which was a great way to see other parts of the island. And the whole drive is just spectacular, with volcanoes and rice fields and plenty of temples to see. They also offer several day tours, but the hotel was so beautiful we decided to spend most of our time relaxing there. We enjoyed the beautiful on-site open air restaurant overlooking the beach (I highly recommended the pizza, BBQ pork ribs, and the banana pancakes!) We booked a dive with the resort next door in their house reef, which was amazing. It\u2019s also a great area for snorkeling, but be sure to pack water shoes because the black sand beach is beautiful but very rocky. Wayan also organized a traditional Balinese fishing trip for us, where we saw many dolphins and managed to catch a small tuna that the staff cooked us for dinner that evening. We also took full advantage of the on site spa, the massages were wonderful. All of the staff were so friendly and attentive. It was an amazing trip and we\u2019re already talking about planning a return visit! I definitely recommend!",

My husband and I had previously stayed at the Villa Saraswati where we had the great fortune to meet the owners of both properties. We hadn\u2019t booked accommodation for the last three days of our holiday and lucky for us we hadn\u2019t, because we would have missed out on a truly incredible experience. For my husband and I, it was the perfect romantic getaway. Our Villa was just superb with a beautifully decorated bedroom and bathroom, private pool and exquisite courtyard kitchen living area for relaxing. The staff were very friendly and went out of their way to assist us.  Check in was personalized and a breeze.  The grounds at the resort were stunning; so serene and tranquil.  There is a fabulous restaurant located on the property situated close to the sea. This place is absolutely stunning and a perfect place to relax, reconnect and revitalize your soul. If you a looking for a tranquil setting and a more authentic Balinese experience with incredible service then this is the place to come.",

Although you can have your breakfast right at seaside, there is no beach near the villas, but the private and very clean swimmingpool is just a few steps from the bedroom of your villa/room. Diving and snorkelling is available from the hotel. The rooms are beautyfully equipped with original Balinese furniture and modern art. The cleaning and the service is very good. The menu card has a good variety of chicken, pork and fish. We particularly loved the \u2018Spring rolls\u2019, the BBQ ribs and the \u2018Gorengs\u2019. The staff will suggest a dish, like: \u2018we just bought fresh tuna, would you like to try it tonight?\u2019 We never regretted that we followed their suggestion. \nThe managers, Wayan and Budy, and all their staff are very friendly and help you plan excursions, book massage, driver, etc. The last day, Budy was our driver and gave us an adventurous drive through the mountains, to the Besakih temple, to a restaurant with the most magnificent view, to a wood carpenter and silver smith and, finally, to our last hotel on this trip to Bali. It was a great pleasure to get to know Budy better. He is very nice to talk with and has a lovely humour and laugh. \nYou easily get the feeling that you are in good company when you talk with both Wayan and Budy and their friendly staff. \nIn The Villas they say: \u2018you come as guests and leave as friends\u2019. So true, thank you \ud83d\ude4f. ",

Amazingly spacious villas with ocean-views, a private pool, large beds, outdoor kitchen and lounge area - what more could you want? There is also excellent snorkelling at the front of the villa, a spa and very helpful staff to make sure your stay is perfect. Definitely recommend for a relaxing holiday.",

This is my fifth stay here and upon arrival I'm immediately reminded why my heart longs for this sanctuary when back home. My wife and I were treated with 3 perfect sunny days, where the visibility for snorkelling was the best it's ever been, the mango smoothie with breakfast was sublime!, the massages were superb, and the staff impeccable. We were treated like old friends from the moment we arrived. This place is so private and is perfectly crafted to give you relaxing and rejuvenating downtime. Watch the hours just slip by while you're in paradise. Cannot recommend this place enough.",

Budi and Wayan and the whole team are awesome hosts - the villas really are beautiful and more than that the stay is magical.\n\nMy recommendations on what to do ?\n- the waterfalls in nearby town are lovely, worth a visit\n- a hike up Mt Batur is well worth the early start\n- diving on USAT Liberty is you are a diver is a must do - but get there early\n- massage and yoga in the villa is splendid\n\nSo you can be sure you will have a lovely time.  Most of all the welcome and the care & professionalism of the team will ensure you leave wanting more",

An extremely hardworking, friendly team demonstrated the most outstanding customer service we have ever received. The Villas are absolute perfection and the location is stunning, views whilst eating dinner over the sea are amazing! Pool is lovely and the outdoor lounge area is bliss. The food is delicious and the spa massages are excellent. Highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Bali. Contact the hotel and they will arrange transport to get you there from anywhere in Bail. Trust me when I say it\u2019s worth the trip, you will not regret it. We named this part of our trip \u2018Paradise\u2019 as it could not have been any better! Thank you to the amazing team.",

The rooms were spacious, and the private pool and outdoor kitchen gave us plenty of space to visit, relax, and unwind. The massages at the spa were excellent, and the meals were home-cooked and delicious. Dining next to the ocean was something one could get used to! We also loved the fishing excursion - we even saw a small eruption on Mt. Agung while we were a few miles off shore - incredible!",

              "text": "We wanted to experience real Bali, away from the crowds and we found this beautiful property expertly run by Budi and Wayan. The staff to guest ratio alone would put many 5 star hotels to shame. With a maximum of 16 guests at any one time spread over 4, 2-bedroom villas, this is the ideal spot for people to completely relax in a calming environment with superb sea views and extremely attentive and professional hospitality.\n\nThe villas themselves have been designed in a traditional Balinese style with 2 master bedrooms/bathrooms, a lovely open air seating/kitchen area and a beautiful pool. They are only 4 years old and maintained to a very high standard. Fixtures, fittings and linens are all a very high quality. The Warung Kelapa (see separate review) anchors the property and the lovely gardens overlook the sea. The spa services are excellent value and expertly delivered. The included breakfast is probably one of the best we have ever had worldwide. The views over the ocean are amazing and the very attentive service from Darma was impeccable. It is a multi-course offering so allow time to relax and do it justice. Fresh juices, fruits and smoothies are followed by a choice of eggs, bacon, tomatoes and the most amazing homemade baked beans. This is then followed by beautiful thin pancakes. if you give them 24hrs notice you can order a fabulous Balinese breakfast.\n\nIt is in a secluded beachfront location but the adjacent Dive Resort (Teluk Kerang) offers alternative dining if required and it is around 15 mins walk to the main road and 20 mins to the early morning market. The transfer from South Bali and the airport is around 3.5hrs and the scenery en-route is spectacular.\n\nWe must finally mention the wonderful staff again. There is a useful profile of them and their family in the room and their training has clearly been of a high standard and their command of the English language is brilliant. Don\u2019t come here if you want nightlife and entertainment. Please come here if you want to completely des-stress, listen to the waves and enjoy luxurious surroundings in a beautiful setting, looked after by attentive staff.\n",

I had forgotten to pack toiletries so they drove me to several stores to pick them up. I was lucky to have the whole villa to myself the whole time. Everything was so clean and the pool deliciously refreshing. The whole place has a soothing, gentle vibe. I ate every day at the restaurant. The food was amazingly fresh and flavorful, I gained my appetite after months. I loved having daily spa treatments while listening to the sound of the waves. I highly recommend dolphin sight seeing at sunrise as well as diving into the reef, just 10 metres away from the restaurant. \n\nBudi and Wayan were always kind and helpful. In many ways, I feel like they treated me as one of their own rather than a guest in a hotel. I'm not sure I even want to call this place a resort, it really goes beyond what I have ever experienced.",

We are also privileged that being a Boutique Hotel with only 8 rooms we are then able to offer each and every one of our guests our personalised but unobtrusive attention.   We are away of how many of our guests have such busy lives back home and so we pride ourselves in creating an atmosphere where you can leave it all behind and simply relax, relax and then relax some more.\nWe look forward to welcoming you back again and this time not as a new guest, but as an old friend.\nSampai Jumpa Lagi !\nWayan, Budi\n& The Staff at The Villas Tejakula",

We were lucky enough to have a private villa on our own, with our own living area and beautiful pool. Days were spent eating delicious food in the on-site Warung Kelapa, reading books by the ocean and the pool, snorkelling, trekking into the mountains to see idyllic waterfalls, receiving superb in-house massages and sleeping in a gorgeous four-poster king bed, quietly cooled by an expert air-conditioning unit and fans. It is obvious no expense was spared in the construction and running of these villas and it's the little things that have you arriving as guests and leaving as friends: free water, private Wi-Fi devices, mobile telephones to use, private fridge to use (stocked), an inclusive breakfast so large and diverse, sarongs to wear, and incredible management where nothing is too much. I have been here many times and I cannot stop coming back. Simply superb.",

Do come here if you want rest, relaxation, excellent accommodations, and a Staff that pampers you with real Bali kindness and hospitality. The 3 1/2 hour trek to get here from the airport is an excursion in itself so save your money and just go stay here! Unbelievable experience. highly recommend!",

We spent 6 nights at The Villas Tejakula - the perfect place to relax and unwind in a fabulous setting.  \n\nThe accommodation is spacious and has everything you could want and it is spotlessly clean.  There are four sets of two rooms each with a shared living area and pool.  During our stay we had the luxury of privacy as we were the only guests.  Unfortunately, there have been fewer guests since the threatened eruption of the volcano.\n\nWayan and Budi were kindness itself and so easy to chat to.  Although we haven't mentioned everyone by name all the staff were keen to help and talk to us and always with a smile.  Ketut tried very hard to teach us some Balinese including giving us a crib sheet. The massages by Iluh were wonderful as was the food, especially when it was eaten sitting by the sea with the waves breaking close by.  The spring rolls were amazing.\n\nBook now - you will never find a more restful and relaxing place and such wonderful hosts as Wayan and Budi.",

The menu is very good and there is no need to venture outside to have a nice dinner. And try the massage - very relaxing.\nThe owners and all staff are very friendly and go out of their way to please the guests. \nThere are just 4 villas with max 4 guest in each villa, so the place is not going to be crowded at any time.\nGreat time and we will be back hopefully.",

              "text": "Having just returned from a 3 night stay at Villa Tejakula, I can honestly say that our whole experience was the perfect finale to our travel through Indonesia. \nI last visited Bali nearly 30 years ago so I was a bit concerned that I would be disappointed by mass tourism and commercialism but Villa Tejakula restored my confidence that areas of authentic Bali still remain. \n\nThe location of the property is unbeatable. We enjoyed a beautiful sea breeze in manicured gardens and we were able to readily interact with friendly locals going about their daily life. We were constantly greeted by big smiles and a chorus of happy children.\n\nEvery part of our stay was handled with perfection from our initial contact with the Villa Tejakula, to our transfers, tours, accommodation and food. We had two adjoining villas, they were spotlessly clean and beautifully appointed. We also had a great private pool which we used a lot because access into the ocean is a bit rocky. The resort is next to a dive shop which my daughters utilised so it was very convenient.\n\nThe restaurant on site has excellent, well priced food and drinks which was an unexpected, welcome bonus. We made use of the spa and my massage could not have been better.\n\nWe travelled as a family of 5 adults and in order to do this we booked direct which I would highly recommend.\n\nWithout doubt the best part of our stay was the wonderful staff. Wayan is an absolute gem, so organised and efficient! Together with her husband, Budi and the entire staff they made sure our stay was very special. The staff were so friendly and did a fantastic job.\n\nThank you Villa Tejakula for a wonderful stay and for providing an oasis that allowed us to experience the natural beauty of Bali and the wonderful, genuine  friendliness of the Balinese.",

From start to finish it was amazing!!!\nWe had transport from ubud which was the best drivers we had during our time in Bali. The rooms and surroundings were spotless. We were lucky enough to have a whole villa to ourselves. It's lovely and quiet and peaceful. The staff are the ones that really make this place and make it so special it felt like home. The breakfast was amazing- I highly recommend the Balinese breakfast. The dinner was lovely lots of choice good serving sizes and amazing service. Massage was lovely- one of the best I've ever had. We walked into the village where the locals waved and spoke to us we felt so welcome. Absolute paradise, thank you so much ",

              "text": "Considering the wide range of expectations that our family of six adults hoped to fulfill within two weeks, these holidays could be likened to a wonder.\n\nStarting with the very beginning: the transfer we have booked was perfectly organised. What a pleasure, after a long flight, to find our driver welcoming us with a smile, cool water and a comfortable car for the smooth three-hour ride through a dramatic landscape\u2026\n\n\u2026 to arrive finally in paradise. Set in a peaceful area far away from the touristic crowds, that Balinese family-owned, small-sized resort awaited us with lush vegetation around and a manicured garden edging the waterfront. All right, there is no real sandy beach around and you might need water shoes, but you\u2019ll have instead a pure 180-degree horizon view with only sea, sun and sky. \nThe accommodation, luxurious with tasteful Balinese flair, was in the same vein. Each 2-bedroom villa had its own courtyard with pool and exotic garden, high-quality beds and dark wood furniture, AC and fan, huge bathroom and rain shower, all amenities perfectly cleaned by a daily room service.\n\nThe setting is one thing, the contents might be another. But there again, the variety of activities offered was almost endless, including diving or snorkeling by the front door in the turquoise water, boating before dinner (and eat the tuna you caught), strolling through the village to the colourful local market in the early morning, sightseeing in the surroundings or laying lazy in the sun all day long on a deck chair. Not to forget the wonderful massages, from head to feet, from hot stones to scrub, one can choose to soothe the body after so much effort! \n\nSo that, at the end of such days, we sat happy and hungry in the lovely, open-air restaurant and enjoyed the local homemade food, from BBQ spare ribs to fish curries or veggies & tofu, including special wishes like gluten-free club sandwiches\u2026 And close the evenings on our own terrace, with some wines from our daily filled \u201cmaxi-fridge\u201d minibar, listening to music (better download at home as the Wifi can be capricious) and looking at the stars or jumping in our pool for a midnight bath!\n\nBut what makes the Villas Tejakula a truly unique place is not the beautiful location, the service-oriented philosophy, the very fair price/quality ratio, the peaceful and high-relaxing rhythm of life there. It is the exceptional and genuine kindness of the whole team and especially of Wayan and her husband Budi who run the place with an ever-ready smile and an infinite patience.\nThank you so much for the wonderful time we had. We look forward to seeing you again!\n\n",

We felt as if we had made so many new friends and were so sad to see you all go, but hope that you will venture our way again in the not too distant future.\nWe are a long way from the Airport but your review has truly ensured that other travellers will feel that the journey is well worth the effort.    \nWe thank you again for your wonderful review and look forward to your return.\nBest wishes\nWayan, Budi & all the staff at The Villas Tejakula",

Thank you for taking the time to write a review for us again - we know that you were delighted with the new additions that we had put in place since your last visit and we will now concentrate on thinking up some more before you return.\nAlthough many guests decide to stay with us because of our Trip Advisor reviews, sadly not many then take the time to share their experience by writing a review.   Thank you for being the exception and we look forward to your stay with us again next year.\nSampai Jumpa Lagi !\nWayan, Budi & The Staff at The Villas Tejakula\n",

              "text": "We, me and my husband Paul, stayed in a deluxe room at The Villas Tejakula for 7 days recently and the experience was more than we could have ever hoped for.\n\nOur arrival was quite late(around 9 pm), after a long journey from Austria and we were really tired. Especially because the transfer from the airport took us around 4 hours, because thick fog on the road along mt batur slowed us down significantly...I just mention this because -in hindsight- we would maybe plan to get to bali a bit earlier or rather stay in kuta for a day, before heading to the Villas, to get a look at the vulcano on the way!\n\nTired as we were, the warm welcome we encountered at the Villas was all that we could have hoped for! They even offered to make us a cheese and bacon sandwich to make up for the fact that we had missed dinner time :) (if you come there you have to try it!!! It tasted like heaven on earth, even though i have to admit that at this point i was so hungry everything would have tasted quite good^^)\n\nOur room, as well as the bedroom and the shower were a lot more spacious than I had expected, based on the photographs i had seen so far and everything was so nicely decorated with flowers for our arrival, we almost felt bad to destroy it, when we went to sleep. \n\nWhat really blew us away the next morning was the pool, that we shared with another couple! We couldn't have dreamed for anything better!\n\nBreakfast is also a treat ;) served at the adjacent Warung, the highlights are clearly the banana pancakes and the fresh fruit juices, but everything is very tasty! There is also the option to order balinese breakfast, but you have to do it 24 hrs in advance...\n\nSpeaking of food we started our week, dining at the warung and were so impressed, that we never considered going anywhere else ;) They serve a variety of cocktails for every taste and you are seated right next to the sea which adds to the wonderful atmosphere<3 if you want to add some romance there is also the option for a dinner for two in the pavillion, which we can highly recommend! \n\nWe never got a spa treatment, so we can not say anything regarding the massages, but we met the masseuse and she seemed extremely nice. If it hadn't been for the tours we arranged for the last three days, we would have gotten treatment there for sure^^\n\nRegarding the tours, we can especially recommend the boat tour. Even though we didn't catch anything, the view and the awesome feeling of gliding through the smooth water with a traditional fishing boat were unforgettable!\n\nWe have read a lot of reviews, here on trip advisor and as some \"helpful reviewers\" have pointed out: there is no tv in the room  and no community pool. Even though i don't quite get the point of a community pool when you have a semi-private/private pool just 5 metres outside your door and tvs are available upon request, but thats a matter of taste!\n\nI think if you are staying at the villas and expect a place where you can party all night you will be disappointed! However, since this wasn't our objective we couldn't have had a more pleasant stay. It's the right place for everyone looking for something quiet and relaxing with amazing food and a lot of privacy, paired with excellent service and beautiful surroundings!\n\nThe Wifi doesn't work in the rooms and only in the living area, which might be a problem to some (if only temporarily^^ they were working hard on a solution when we left! We don't think it will take longer than 1-2weeks to have wifi access throughout the property again...) but we didn't mind! We are used to being available non stop, so this was a nice  change :)\n\nWhat really sets this experience apart from other places we have stayed in, was the more than friendly service! The whole staff is extremely welcoming and so helpful, they make you feel right at home :) -a luxurious home- but a home nonetheless! Special shoutout to Wayan and Budi the managers, who made our stay as perfect as we wanted it to be and helped us with the tour booking! \n\nThe only thing we regrett is not booking for longer! We will come back again as soon as possible!\n\nLena and Paul",

Being a Boutique Hotel we are able to ensure that all of our guests are given individual attention but at the same time ensuring that they have plenty of privacy to relax and enjoy the beauty and tranquility that we offer at our Beachfront location.    From the wonderful comments in your review our small team of staff have achieved that and more.    We are in a more remote part of Bali but for those who venture North to discover us we can offer a truly remarkable experience.   A holiday filled with as much activity as you wish or a stunning environment in which to relax and do absolutely nothing but be surrounded by Balinese welcoming smiles and their wonderful pampering.    We wish you a long and happy life together and thank you once again for posting not only a review but also some of your photographs.\nWe look forward to your return to us.    Sampai Jumpa Lagi !\nWayan, Budi & the Staff at The Villas Tejakula ",

              "text": "One of the things we enjoyed most about this lovely hotel were the managers, Wayan and Budi. Their resort is a labor of love to them, and the love is obvious. It's ideal for two couples traveling together -- each villa has two bedrooms, a common area, and a swimming pool -- although we enjoyed the villas by ourselves (shhh....skinny dipping!) as the other room was unoccupied. The rooms are spotless. As another reviewer noted, there is no public pool nor TV, and we were thankful to have neither. The restaurant is quite good, but we had just arrived from the Kayon Resort and so our food bar was set pretty high. Most of the clientele is northern European, it seems, and (yea!) Americans were a bit rare. The inn next door offers scuba diving, which we enjoyed. \n\nNo, there is not much excitement there. And that's a good reason to go.",

Our small team of staff at The Villas Tejakula take great pride in ensuring that all of our guests are made to feel individually special and it seems that once again they were successful.   It is important that when guests travel the 3 hours from the Airport to stay with us that they then enjoy the experience we offer.   There is snorkeling and diving should you wish, plenty of treatments to be enjoyed in our spa while listening to the waves as well as a number of half and full day tours. \nThis is the place to come to just relax and practice the age old art of doing nothing.We were delighted to be able to assist you in doing just that and hope that you have returned home refreshed from your holiday and planning your next visit to Bali.    We hope to see you then.\nWith best wishes from\nBudi, myself and all of the Staff at The Villas Tejakula",

The staff treated us like friends from the moment of our arrival when we enjoyed a warm welcome and all were friendly from the bottom of their heart. I was also impressed that the whole staff knew my name from the beginning and alsways asked how I am when meeting them. We enjoyed our villa with pool shared with two other guests, however, as there is a lot to do in the north of Bali we had the pool for our own for many, many hours.\n\nPart of the resort is a really good restaurant with the same excellent and friendly service. We once ordered a whole tuna grilled in banana leaf one day in advance. This has than be bought for us by lovely Weda, who supervises the restaurant, at the local market the following morning and we then enjoyed it perfectly served in the evening. As it was a little too big for us, they kept the rest for us which we finished next day.\n\nOur stay at The Villas Tejakula than we expected even tough we knew about and bokked because of the excellent TripAdvisor reviews. What will remain in our minds are all the friendly people and the beautiful resort where we relaxed, enjoyed customized trips and went snorkeling just a few meters from the ocean-view dining area.\n\nMany thanks to Wayan, Budi and the staff for this lifelong memories!\n\nMatthias & Marie",

It is usually a bit too much food on the day but we are always happy to prepare another meal with what is left for you to enjoy on the next day.  Then of course there is the Mahi Mahi and the unbelievably tender Squid - not to mention a selection of wonderful Balinese and western dishes.\nThe snorkeling just 20 metres from shore is one of the highlights for guests travelling to the North Coast of Bali and we are proud of our House Reef and its excellent condition.  Diving can also easily be arranged through the adjacent Dive Centre, wonderful massages in our Spa and a host of Half or Full Day Tours for guests to enjoy.\nWe hope that your journey home was a safe one and we look forward to welcoming you back to The Villas Tejakula again soon.

              "text": "I would recommend you to round up your Bali trip with this hotel, to have a few days escape from the busy Bali city life of Ubud, Seminyak....etc.  \n\nVilla Tejakula located at the end of a local village beside the sea. While enjoying the privacy from your luxurious villa, you are still able to experience the village life in Bali. \nTejakula is a place unspoiled by tourism in Bali relatively, you would be greeted by the curious but friendly villagers when you walk out from the hotel. When taking a walk outside the villa, you would bump into a lot of chicken, and meet the local children busy showing off their kites or biking skill to foreigners. \n\nYou feel so peaceful with the village life especially after experienced the touristic Bali cities. No one here in Tejakula greeted you with purpose at least. \n\nDuring my visit, the village was holding Hindu ceremony for a deceased villager. You get to hear their chanting every night (I heard from the villa\u2019s host that the chanting for deceased will last for a few days and it\u2019s normal practice for villagers in Bali. It would stop before your bed time though), and they had ceremony at the temple right beside the villa during day time. The chanting and singing were not bordering at all if you have an open-mind. To me, that was some real exotic experience and I think that\u2019s what travel meant for.   \n\nThere is zero light pollution in Tejakula. My husband and I were lucky enough to have clear sky at night during our stay, we saw shooting stars almost every ten minutes and a very obvious milky way too. So make sure you have appropriate star-gazing apps downloaded before checking in Villa Tejakula. \n\nVilla Tejakula is a small villa with 8 rooms only. So the hosts remember everyone\u2019s requests and you get to enjoy some personal touch from the hosts.  I mentioned once in my correspondence with Wayan that it was my husband\u2019s birthday on the fourth night of our stay. She took initiative to decorate our room on the day and made us a birthday cake at dinner time. Wayan and her husband Budi greet the guests every morning during breakfast time and make sure that all is well with the guests. I appreciate their effort and kindness very much.  \n\nWe also love to read the brochure introducing all the hotel staffs too (from hotel managers to security guard and gardener). Most of them had worked for other resorts at the cities, and now they have a chance to come back to Tejakula and work closer to their home near the villa and take care of their children after work. \nYou can see how this rare luxurious villa located at the heart of local villages meant something to the staffs, and perhaps this is the reason why the staffs all look happy and energetic working at the villa.     \n\nThere\u2019s practically nothing you can do at Villa Tejakula except star gazing, snorkelling, diving, sunbathing, reading and eating\u2026. You can book a massage and they can also arrange yoga class for guests. You may take 10 to 15 minutes walk to some local shops for grocery (do not expect supermarket), or enjoy some real cheap local food from the food stalls along the road (we had Mie Ayam at less than USD1)\n\nThere are a few minor things that I wish the villa can improve. First, they may consider installing a telephone inside the room, so the guests can request something from their room without walking all the way to the restaurant area. They may even order in-room dining when getting too lazy so that the private pantry area would not be wasted. Secondly, their wifi service needs serious improvement; I went to the diving resort next door for dinner and their wifi was excellent and stable. So remoteness should not be an obstacle for stable wifi. Thirdly, I hope there would be more snorkelling shoes in women size (common size from 37 to 40). \n\nOther than that, nothing to complain about and I enjoyed my stay a lot. Do not forget to ask the host to arrange a tour along with your way to the Villa Tejakula from the city, so to make the three hours drive more worthwhile and interesting.",

You both embraced the unique experience of leaving the busy tourist areas behind and exploring a lesser known area of Bali.   It is one that gives you a more intimate experience of our island and the upside is a quieter and more peaceful environment, wonderfully clear skies that give you a panorama to enjoy at night, beautiful sunrises and sunsets and happy smiling village people.    \nYou will be pleased to know that we have replenished our selection of Reef Shoes so that we now have all shoes sizes catered for.\nThe patchy Wi Fi is out of control but we have now purchased more Modems so that guests can have a connection whenever they wish.    We appreciate that this contact is essential in today's world and we are doing our best to solve the problem until the Fibre Optic is in place.  \nThank you once again for taking the time to write such a wonderful review and share so much of your experience.   Time and again guests say that they chose to stay with us because of our reviews, but sadly very few of them take the time to share their experience as well.\nWe look forward to welcoming you both back to The Villas Tejakula.   Travel safely.\nBest wishes\nWayan, Budi & The Staff at The Villas Tejakula \n",

Diving can also be organised through the adjacent Dive Centre and the Liberty Wreck at Tulamben is only a 40 minute drive away as well.   Many guests enjoy the Les Waterfall and some do longer Tours to brave the many steps up to some of Bali's most spectacular waterfalls, all found on the north coast.\nWe are happy that you enjoyed your time with us and we look forward to welcoming you both back to The Villas Tejakula next year.\nUntil then\nBest wishes from\nWayan, Budi and all the Staff at The Villas Tejakula",

The Villas are organised across 4 garden 'compounds each with 2 large beautiful rooms and a private pool. There is a kitchen and open living area between the 2 rooms. You can book one or both rooms. Absolutely beautiful high grade linen and towels, outdoor furniture and sun lounges. A maximum of 16 guests at any one time. There are coral beds that can be accessed from the rocky beach. And great food from the restaurant.  If you fancy a few nights of quiet luxury this place is definitely a must.  And Wayan and Budi the managers are awesome. Please note that Tejakula is a remote location so wifi is poor. But if absolutely necessary Budi can assist. Take books.",

From the moment we arrived Budi, Wayan and the staff made us feel comfortable and welcome taking the time to show us our immaculate villa, which was to be our home for the next week, and updating us on the new facilities since our last visit. Warung Kelapa is the restaurant attached to the Villas and serves delicious meals from the freshest produce available and wide selection. Extensions to the Warung have given more capacity for guests to enjoy the absolute waterfront position and food was delivered quickly and wait staff always on hand to make sure everything was good.\nThe Spa is located in the garden area and takes advantage of the breeze and the sound of the waves on the beach. The therapist (Iluh) is very good and we had multiple treatments during our stay.\nThe enthusiasm and friendliness of the staff and their pride in their part of the team makes for a wonderful holiday. With great snorkelling, diving, fishing and excursions at the doorstep you can be as busy or relaxed as you like. \nThanks to Budi and Wayan, Made(Super Chef) Weda, Gede, Darma and Iluh. Also thanks to Ketut, Made, Dana, Sri and Gede for maintaining the Villas and grounds to such a high standard and ensuring we are safe and secure.\nTotally enjoyed our return visit and looking forward to next year. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",

Well we found paradise!!!! The owners Wayan and Budi are so kind. They make you feel like family. Being our first time to Bali, I was a little nervous and did a lot of planning. I emailed Wayan several times confirming pickups, currency exchange, and tours. Even before we arrived Wayan was great at answering all my questions and making me feel comfortable with our trip. When we arrived, I knew we had chosen the perfect place! The villas are really beautifully decorated. It's so nice having your own pool! If you are unsure about sharing the villa with someone else, don't be nervous! It's still so private and intimate. My husband and I spent a lot of time just reading around the pool because it was so relaxing and at night you can lay outside and star gaze. The beach is very lovely as well. It's a rocky beach with black sand but I have never seen water so clean. The water just feels refreshing as well. I have been to a lot of beaches in Asia and this one by far had the best water. Also the sunsets are the best! I have never seen sunsets so beautiful and dramatic. I loved it! The staff is extremely friendly. My husband and I both have gluten intolerance and they got us gluten free bread. This is the first place that I have ever been that has catered to our food needs. The food is the best we have ever had. It's better than top notch restaurants. The tuna is so fresh! You must try their balinese specials that they have each day. Breakfast is huge! I have never ate so much on a vacation, but it was worth it! Also, I loved waking up and seeing Darma's smiling face. He is so nice and sweet to his customers. Wede is very attentive to all of your needs as well. Also, you must get a massage! In sum, I can't recommend staying here enough. I am already thinking about our next trip here!!!!",

It's difficult to describe how perfect this place is.  The reason we always look for smaller villa-type places to stay is the personal interaction and service and we were not disappointed.  Budi and Wayan were the perfect hosts and made sure we were taken care of.  The room, the pool, the outdoor living area of our villa were all amazing and the perfect place to relax.  We had all of our meals at the restaurant and they were great, freshly prepared and served by delightful staff.  The massage was amazing as well. There are 2 routes to the villas from the airport.  Make sure you take both of them as you arrive and leave.  They both have interesting sights.  Our driver stopped along the way to let us take in some of the sights.",

This is the comment that we hear so often when guests have booked for 2 or 3 nights and then just do not want to leave.   That in itself is a great reward for all of the Staff at The Villas Tejakula as it lets us know that we have all done our jobs well and have made you feel so pampered and spoilt.   We pride ourselves that our guests feel like new friends when they finally depart and it is often a sad day to say goodbye.\nWe look forward to your next stay with us and hopefully you can manage to make it longer next time.\nBest wishes,\nWayan Parniti\nThe Villas Tejakula",

The Villa (Ganesha) was peaceful and quiet.  The pool, inviting.  Everything we needed was there including a sarong to use as a cover-up.\n\nBreakfast is a multi course adventure - the \"pancake\" is a delightful crepe.  Dinner menu has great variety with classic local dishes.  Do not leave without having an iced mochacchino.  If you are lucky you might merit a birthday cake made by Weda.  If you are longing for something western to eat, try the \"pizza\" a foodies delight.\n\nTake the walk to the local market in the early morning to drink in the local flavor, it is worth the walk.  On the way back, keep an eye out for the play yard at the local school.  It is quite a site when the entire school is doing morning stretch.",

For a small fraction of what I paid to stay in a tiny Villa in Nusa Dua, Villas Tejakula offers absolutely gorgeous, large, impeccably furnished Villa's, each with a large private pool, an indoor out door living room and master bath, and complete privacy.  The small public area is also quite nice, with meals served beside the water, and the owners and staff are delightful.   There is nothing not to recommend about Villa's Tejakula for a hideaway in a relatively obscure, non-touristy, and completely unspoiled part of Bali along the North Coast.  There's good swimming and decent snorkeling in front of the Villas, but don't expect a sand beach or spectacular reefs anywhere along this part of the Coast.",

The on-site meals are to die for and the Balinese massages are incredible. We stayed for 4 days and did not want to leave. The villas are beautiful and every detail has been thought out for you. There are too many amenities to list. Each villa has a private pool that was the highlight of our visit. It is very interesting that they have prayers and make offerings three times a day. We would see incense with offerings outside our villa every time we left. They said they prayed for each of their guests. We loved their warmth and hospitality. We can't wait to return to do it all again.",

It is a quiet part of Bali so don't expect night clubs and shopping but that is part of its charm.\n\nSituated between the mountains and the sea it is in a beautiful spot. There is very good snorkelling from the beach right by the restaurant. The Villas themselves are finished to the highest standard and are very comfortable and inviting. As good as any five-star resort with the added bonus of a laid-back vibe. \n\nWayan and Budi and all of the staff are wonderful and made us feel so welcome. There is an in-house spa offering a wide range of treatments. What better way to relax than have a massage with the sound of waves in the background.\n\nThe food is definitely worth a mention from the plentiful breakfast to the lunch/ dinner menu - it is very varied offering western and Indonesian choices and all cooked from fresh. Particular favourites were the Balinese chicken and mahi-mahi (fish)\n\nWe hired a scooter for the day. We headed east to go snorkelling at the Liberty wreck and then onto the Amed coast. Also close by is the Les Waterfall which is definitely worth a visit \n\nAll in all we would definitely recommend the Villas as a place to stay to experience the real Bali. \n\n",

              "text": "It was our first visit to Bali and we spent the first few days in Kuta, which is busy, dirty and expensive, so i wasn't sure what to expect when we arrived at The Villas. Their driver picked us up from our hotel in Kuta and it took us nearly 4 hours to get to Tejakula. It's a nice drive and you get to see a lot of the countryside, however, the roads are narrow, windy and often quite busy so i was very glad that i wasn't driving!\n\nThe Villas are the complete contrast to Kuta. Quiet, friendly,clean and relaxing. We were met by Wayan on arrival and she showed us to our room and showed us where all the lights and amenities were in our room and the kitchen area. She asked if i wanted milk for my tea and when i said yes, the milk arrived about 2 minutes later!\n\nThe rooms and communal areas are very well cleaned and maintained, as is the pool area. They are meticulous with the cleaning, especially when there is a changeover.\n\nWe then had some lunch, even though technically we were a bit late for lunch. The menu is fairly small but has a good and varied selection of food with reasonable prices. During our stay we tried lots of things from the menu; for lunch we had the club sandwich which was lovely, the chicken and sweetcorn soup is really good and the pizzas are also exceptional. The tuna and mahi mahi is also very good. I tried some of the Balinese food which was really nice but maybe a little too spicy for me. They do ask how you would like it but i think that the Balinese idea of not very spicy and mine vary a little! The balinese breakfast is very nice and worth a try as is the Balinese evening meal (requires notice at breakfast i think but worth it)\n\nWe also did snorkelling just off the beach area. We saw a good variety of fish, including a lion fish, puffer fish and also a pod of dolphins. The snorkelling is best as the tide goes out and the reef is a little closer to the surface.\n\nIf you want somewhere that gets you away from it all and is really quiet and peaceful then this is the place for you. The staff are all lovely and very understanding. they are all eager to help you have the best holiday that you can. The food and drink prices are very reasonable. The massages are wonderful and i had a skin exfoliation treatment and my skin felt really soft afterwards.\n\nWe did one of the trips, but mostly just chilled out, slept, read and snorkelled.\n\nThe staff are all very welcoming and good at their jobs and their main aim is to make sure that you have a great and relaxing break.\n\nThank you to all. We arrived feeling tired and stressed and reluctantly went home 7 days later feeling relaxed and chilled out.",

It is a long way from the Airport, but as you said \"worth the trip\" as once you are here overlooking the Bali Sea it is very quiet and peaceful and our small team of staff do their best to ensure that all guests receive specialised attention.\nWe look forward to welcoming you back again when you are next in Bali.\nBest wishes,\nWayan & Budi\nManagers\n",

We shared the pool and living area with another couple for two nights then had the complex to ourselves for the remainder. Made and his helpers keep the pool, common living area and the pleasant Villas super clean. There is no sea view from the Villas, only from the dining area and lawn area under the palm trees adjacent to the beach. Dining is very pleasant next to the sound of the waves. The food is fresh and simply prepared. The main attraction at the Villas is the walk in snorkelling. However the ocean was fairly turbulent  and muddy for some of our stay so we enjoyed our villa's 10 metre pool instead. There are a variety of excursions offered as other than diving, snorkelling, fishing there is nothing much to see/do in the vicinity. \nIf you are looking for a small, quiet, pleasant, relaxing resort for family or couple and don't mind the distance to get there then this is the place.

On arrival Budy welcomed us with chilled refreshing facetowels and a complimentary drink then showed us to our very spacious villa,  huge extremely comfy bed, great ensuite bathroom.  Outside the Villa is a large shared garden courtyard space (with 1 other adjoining villa) with a lovely pool, sun loungers and open air living room to chill out in.  Having a swim before breakfast or last thing under the stars is total bliss.  The restaurant food is especially tasty.  We had dinner here everynight, a range of authentic balinese dishes and beyond,  the food is all freshly prepared,  locally sourced where poss and tastes truly divine.  Breakfast is very good also.  The beach is black sand and pebbles which appears then disappears with the tides so there are sun loungers on a terraced area overlooking the sea,  underneath the palm trees... perfect! We snorkled 2-3 times a day and in the corals saw a turtle,  plenty of tropical fish and a pod of dolphins.   Wayan and Budy helped us decide on a few trips,  git git waterfall,  feeding monkeys, Pura Ulun Danu Temple on Lake Bratan one day, snorkelling the nearby USAT Liberty wreck at Tulamben, tip - leave after breakfast around 9am to get there before the crowds!  Rice fields,  Tirtagangga water palace on another day,  and a 2 hour trip to the local Yeh Mempeh waterfall.  All wonderful and a nice break from completely relaxing!  All the staff are very friendly and helpful and made our stay here special. The Villas Tejakula might seem a bit remote but if you want a laid back, completely chilled out, no stress holiday... it's perfect!",

Our villa shared a common pool and living room with another however we felt completely secluded and relaxed.  The restaurant on property is very good and will serve all of your needs while visiting.  Everyone is very accommodating and there is no better place to go to if you want to get off the grid and relax.  No TV's on property either.",

              "text": "The rooms are gorgeous.  That is the villas are gorgeous. Each villa consists of two LARGE bedrooms, a shared open air living area with stove, kettle and stocked honor system fridge (beer, wine, soda). Every room looks like it could be out of Architectural Digest, Bali.   The grounds look like a movie set of what a tropical paradise should look like.  In short, the setting, the rooms are with the price of admission.  The icing on the cake, the friendliest most accommodating you will ever likely encounter. Wayan, Budi, Weta, Made, Gede all make life at the Villas an effortless joy.   The food here is superb.  I highly recommend the fish dishes. In every case, the seafood is freshly caught and perfectly prepared.  You will eat Oceanside, under Palm trees, with the moon reflecting on the Bali Sea. You can snorkel directly in front of the Villas (equipment available from the Villas).  To sum up, if you book a stay here, the only regret you will have is that you didn't stay longer.",

The genuine hospitality of all the staff at the villas; the fresh flavours of the tasty Balinese food that we ate for breakfast, lunch and dinner was a highlight. Tejakula is a beautiful, quiet area that reminds me of the Bali I first fell in love with 30 years ago. We did a sunrise boat trip and saw numerous pods of dolphins swimming beside our boat and leaping from the water very close to us...an amazing experience.\nThe villas are of a very high standard in their presentation, comfort and cleanliness. Our very own swimming pool in our villa compound was fabulous. Highly recommended if you want to have a relaxing break in a beautiful and quiet region of Bali. \nThank you Wayan, Boudie and all the staff for a gorgeous holiday.",

Responses must meet TripAdvisor's Management Response Guidelines.\nwayan p, Manager at The Villas Tejakula, responded to this review\nDear Jessica, \nWe were very sorry to read your review and my staff were very upset. \nWhen you requested a room change (due to very happy guests celebrating in the next Villa) we were very prompt to accommodate you and this gave you the added advantage of having a 2 Bedroom Villa to yourself rather than sharing with another couple as is normally the case with a Deluxe King Room. \nI spoke to you at Breakfast and I am aware that our service was slow that morning as everyone seemed to arrive at same time. Your Banana smoothie was also late as the fruit we had taken delivery of that morning was not satisfactory and we sent someone to buy more locally. I do apologise for this delay but I am surprised that you were unhappy with how it was served \u2013 it was in a standard wine glass (not a small one) and we have never had a complaint about the quantity before. It is only the smoothie which is served in this glass and the freshly made fruit juice comes in a different glass. \nFor Breakfast, we offer our guests fresh fruit with homemade yoghurt or muesli fruit and yoghurt, with your choice of a freshly made fruit juice (not from a box) or a smoothie. \nYou then have a choice of eggs, tomato & bacon (and baked beans) which you can choose to have with or without toast. You are also able to have more toast with your tea or coffee and most of our jams are home made as well. In addition to this we also offer you a Banana Pancake and even more toast, tea or coffee upon request\u2013 so we have found that rather than complain about the quantity many guests say that it does not leave them any room for lunch. If you wished to have more toast you only had to ask.\nThe motor scooters that you mention are a part of life in Bali and are everywhere, but the scooters you had heard would have been gone very quickly as this is not a through road and the traffic is minimal.\nWhat a shame that you arrived at 4.00 p.m. one day and then left by noon the next day as I am sure that had you booked to stayed longer you would have begun to enjoy the truly unique experience that we offer. \nAs we had acted very promptly to your complaint re the noisy guests less than one hour after your arrival, I do wish you had spoken to me about your other concerns rather than in the public arena. \nI assure you that the comfort, happiness and wellbeing of our guests is of paramount importance to us and I think that our reviews are a testament to this. We have a wonderful team of staff who always do their very best to take care of our guests and have had their efforts rewarded with the wonderful reviews that we have received to date. I do not know of the other places you stayed in Bali as you only reviewed our Hotel but once again the majority of our guests are highly complimentary of every aspect of our business.\nWayan Parniti, Manager",

Hotel is very modern and villas are very very nice and have everything you need. 2 villas share 1 swimming pool and kitchen, swimming pool is quite large and kitchen has everything what you need. Breakfast are very tasty and overall food quality is exceptional, I highly recommend burger from restaurant menu.",

Activities include massages for $25.00,ocean fishing, scooter hire,swimming in private secluded swimming pools,dolphin watching, waterfall walks,scuba diving,and just relaxing. Food was excellent in variety and quality. Managers, owners and staff were all were very warm and friendly. They could not do enough for their guests and were more like old friends by the time we left. The two bedroom Villas  are best suited for  families with 2 adults and 2 young adults over ten (because the pool lacks safety fencing) or two couples who are friends, as the living area is a shared space. Each bedroom has its own ensuite and is air conditioned. A great Holiday choice if you are looking for a quiet location away from the city's nightlife and bustle. It is on Bali's north coast nearly 3 hour's drive from Kuta. We had a great holiday.",

There are 4 two-bedroom villas on the property, each with a shared living area & pool so if you are just renting one of the bedrooms be prepared to share the living space & pool with another couple. \n\nThe rooms are large & spacious with great air conditioning. The bathrooms are also beautiful. The shared living area contains couches, tables, a kitchen area and a CD player. This all overlooks the pool. \n\nThe staff are all lovely & do their job well. The chef is amazing, creating beautiful dishes & different specials daily. The wait staff know your name & are attentive. The managers are efficient & friendly. They are so easy to get along with & so obliging to help organise tours (we went scuba diving, fishing & to the waterfall). The spa is very relaxing & the massages are top quality!! \n\nCannot say enough about this place, we loved our 6 nights here & will be back!! \n\nBe aware it is quite far from the airport, about 3hrs drive but very scenic! Don't forget travel medication if you are prone to car sickness.",

              "text": " The reason we chose to book 6 nights here was because of the fantastic reviews on TripAdvisor. Naturally then, we had high expectations when we arrived. I'm very happy to say that our expectations were met and exceeded. From the great transport to the Villas over the mountains, to the warm welcome and treatment during our stay, we all loved our visit! The Villas are beautiful inside and out and are located about 50m or so from the shore and the restaurant which serves the most delicious food. The prices are very reasonable and are of a very high standard. Western and Balinese dishes are available and both types are delicious. Their beef tenderloins are imported from high quality Australian beef and are cooked to perfection and the fish is freshly sourced. We took the Villa boat out with Made and caught two fish that were cooked up and served for dinner. \nThere is a great waterfall, snorkelling and diving nearby among other attractions. The Spa is very good and massages very nice.\nThe Villas themselves are very well appointed and luxurious. The pool, shared with the other room making up the two-bedroom villa, is very clean and modern as are the Villas themselves. It is gorgeous to gaze out over at night from the outdoor kitchen / shared living area with all of the pool and garden lights on. That brings me to the meticulously landscaped gardens that are maintained by a dedicated and hardworking gardener that takes care of the whole property. It truely adds to the calming effect that Wayan and Budi (the mangers) strive so hard to provide. They simply could not do enough to ensure that our stay was hassle free and one to remember. All of the staff are very helpful, friendly and very happy to lend a hand or teach guests a little bit of the Balinese language and culture. The Villas Tejakula are located around 3hrs from Denpasar via a picturesque scenic van ride through the mountains. The staff are very happy to stop along the way to let guest have a look at landmarks and take pictures. The Villas are most suited to couples holidaying together. This is so that they can take advantage of booking one whole 2 bedroom villa and having a pool to themselves and not having to share one. They are still great for couples on their own as long as they don't mind sharing a pool and outdoor living space together.\nThanks again Wayan, Budi and staff for a wonderful stay - We will be back as soon as we can! \n\n",

              "text": "My family - 2 adults and 2 boys aged 14 and 10years had 5 lovely nights at The Villas Tejakula in January.  The villas were beautifully appointed and very luxurious - lovely to have our own private pool and tranquility.  Bodi and Wayan are extremely good hosts and lovely people - all of the team at The Villas were very attentive and looked after us all, accommodating our every need.  We chartered their little boat one day and had a beautiful morning snorkelling in the clear waters - lots of coloured fish and sea stars.  Had a great walk to the waterfall and invigorating swim underneath.  The dive school next door had unfortunately closed for the season so we weren't able to dive.  Also possibly not a great amount to do for younger kids - my 10 year old went a little stir crazy by the end.  Perfect for adults wanting some R & R though.",

              "text": "This was our third trip to Bali and my wife and I decided we wanted to try some \nun-touristy, out of the way places for a change. Some life events over the past 6 months had made us want to have a vacation that was more on the quiet, relaxing side - but in a beautiful setting. We also really enjoy snorkeling and it's those characteristics that drew us to the Villas Tejakula. It was a fairly quick one hour drive from our previous stop in Amed, and about a 3 hour drive back to the airport. No big deal when you have a safe driver and are taking in the beautiful views of Bali. Arriving at the Villas was breathtaking! We lucked out and had our villa to ourselves. Everything about the accommodations, villa, pool, staff, grounds etc. was TOP NOTCH! Having the a great little snorkeling reef right off the back shore was a real treat - you could just go in anytime and enjoy the underwater life. We even saw a reef octopus!! Breakfast was included and was very good, although the limited choices became redundant after two days for us. Being so remote, we had read ahead of time that the restaurant on site was the best place in the area to eat - and we were not disappointed. We never felt the desire to even research another place to go and eat. Our lunches and dinners were all amazing and very fairly priced in our opinion. The menu was fairly small, but had enough variety for our 4 days stay there. As well, special requests were always very enthusiastically received and taken care of with a smile. A must try is the whole tuna cooked in banana leaf - amazing! We were only the 2 of us and had a fair amount of tuna leftover and the staff offered to keep it for us to have for lunch the next day. Mixed with a salad, it was perfect. Speaking of the salad - I loved it - ordered it almost every day! Thank you to all the staff who made our stay here a wonderful, unforgettable experience from start to finish: Gede, Made, Weda, Budi, Wayan and everyone we encountered. You guys have a great thing going at Villas Tejakula - keep it up!!",

We arrived after midnight but still received a warm welcome from the friendly staff. Once you see your villa with the stunning bathroom and beautiful bedroom, you know how heaven looks like. Every villa has an open shared living room and an amazing private pool. All the staff is very helpful and do everything they can to make you feel welcome. They have a nice little spa and beautiful natural garden with seaview. The restaurant is simple but excellent food, breakfast delicious with fresh fruit and juice, omelets and lovely banana pancakes. Wayan and Budi are very friendly managers and are willing to arrange anything for you. We are definitely coming back.....",

The land is owned by a Balinese family and Budi and Wayan are truly gracious and welcoming hosts. \n\nTheir partner and his family spend much of their time there. They've built this place to be their home and you'll enjoy all the comforts they've so thoughtfully chosen to live with. \n\nThis is an authentic Bali ocean experience. It is quiet. The ocean is beautiful. \u00a0There is an amazingly biodiverse reef just seventy feet from shore to snorkel. \n\nThe food is delicious and my dietary choices were graciously accommodated and elegantly executed. We ate every meal there for a few days and we were always satisfied and delighted by every new thing we tried. \n\nIt's quiet. Expect to entertain yourself with a book or conversation with a dear friend. There are fabulous day trips to go to, but we enjoyed the peace and tranquility. \n\nThey helped us hang our aerial silks rig from a coconut tree on the deck. Your requests might not be so exotic but know that they'll be met thoughtfully.\n\nWe enjoyed The Villas Tejakula so much that we've decided to spend our last days in Bali at their sister villa in Ubud. \n\nWe like these people and we're grateful for how at home they made us feel. \n\nA good price for a great stay in Bali.

              "text": "My partner and I spent 4 days here over Christmas 2016. We could not rave about The Villas Tejakula more! Starting from their fantastic transfer service (competitive pricing made it worth it), to the incredibly kind staff. Every single member of staff treated us like family. They were friendly and helpful. The rooms are modern, yet not overdone, creating a peaceful environment. Also the whole resort is very clean. The pool to each room is just perfect, nice and cool and a good depth. Each villa shares the perfect space to relax with a book and the beautiful location really just tops it all off. The spa is well worth it, and not overpriced like most resort in-house spas. Now for the best bit - the FOOD! We had 4 days so plenty of time to try a lot on the menu and it was all phenomenal. \nWe were up north to do some Scuba Diving and the dive centre right next door, was also great. It meant we could relax in the most comfort, have the best food, and get the diving in that we love. \nThank you Wayan & Budi for such a great experience, we loved feeling a part of the Family. Dean & Robin, thank you for creating such an outstanding place to relax. Its perfect.",

              "text": "This place is definitely not for those seeking for bustle and nightlife on Bali. But if you want to spend days in tropical paradise, consider Villas Tejakula. It is a secluded and quiet property located right on the waterfront. The guest houses are spacious, very cosy and perfectly well groomed. You are given a private territory with a swimming pool, garden and lounge.\nIf you like swimming and snorkelling, the beautiful home reef is only 20-30 meters into the sea, abundant in corals, fish, and other wonders. Have a beer at the beachfront restaurant and plunge into waves, or do it vice versa.\nAnd of course I would like to say many thanks to Wayan - lady of the house - and other people helping her with keeping the place. You can't find more attentive and caring hosts.\nAll in all I highly recommend The Villas Tejakula.",

              "text": "This is a small hotel in an idyllic beachfront location with a backdrop of mist topped mountains. I am writing this sat in the shade of a palm tree whilst listening to the waves lapping. It really does not get much better than this. The management Wayan & Budy are absolutely lovely and go out of their way to ensure everything is perfect. All the staff are superb and the food is absolutely delicious. I can recommend the ribs and barbecued whole tuna. The rooms are spacious and very clean with crisp bed linen and an excellent bathroom. The place feels newly built or refurbished. Each two bedroom villa shares a private pool with the adjoining villa and as we stayed as two couples it was very private. The area is secluded and very quiet which is exactly what we wanted. The local temple is very close and we were invited to one of the ceremonies which was an unforgettable experience. Oh and the snorkelling off the hotels private coral reef is great too. I would recommend this place without hesitation to anybody wanting to \"get away\" from things for a few days in total luxury",

I've stayed at this immaculate slice of heaven since it opened and you can't help but dream of your next stay on your departure. The Villas Tejakula has expanded since my last visit in April 2016, there is now water-side dining and a bar with cocktails. Such wonderful new additions demonstrate that feedback and comments are listened to and are actioned. The staff are there to assist you with absolutely any question or inquiry. The massages were relaxing; the food perfection; the snorkelling amazing; and the villas - your own private oasis. This is my favourite place to stay in the world. It will be yours too.",

The staff here are amazing - so warm, friendly, welcoming and helpful. I came to relax and unwind from the grind of daily life and work. That relaxation began the moment we arrived. There are activities to do here such as day tours, snorkelling and riding scooters. However, if all you want to do is relax you are guaranteed that will happen. I have had a couple of massages and a scooter ride to Amed. There are nearby local markets to visit and a waterfall to see as well.",

Spend a week in The Villas in Oct-Nov w our family (4 adults). Beautiful villa, very well taken care of, clean, cozy & well planned. Wayan & Budi and their excellent personnel took so good care of us. My husband's special diet was organized even we didn't ask them to do that. What ever was needed, it was arranged. We made some small tours around - whenever we wanted to, wherever we wanted to. Ate almost all the meals in the Villas, and enjoyed. The food was very good. Blue sea stars & and a natural aquarium in 20 meters from the coastline. Relaxing and healing massage when listening to waves. Go there. You will be spoiled. \n",

It was great! \n\nBeachfront Warung Kelapa restaurant with freshly made food and super attentive staff, comfortable yet very stylish accommodation in 2-bedroom villa with private pool, snorkeling on a beautiful reef just in front of the resort. Managers, lovely Wayan and Budi were always there, ready to address any needs, make us feel very welcome and share wonderful insight about Balinese culture. Kids could freely roam around and explore.\n\nHighly recommended! Also, we have done a trip to nearby The Les Waterfall, short drive by car followed by 20 minutes walk through the jungle ended under the ice cold waterfall where one could get a 'gentle' massage by falling streams of water. More trips around possible or just relax in the villa and read books.",

              "text": "We stayed at the Villas Tejakula for four nights, and our experience was PERFECT. \n\nThe villas are absolutely flawless. They thought of everything. The bathrooms are beautiful and well equipped. Same with the kitchen. Everything was impeccably clean. So many small details were thought of -- even the disc drive with endless relaxing music.  The honest bar is perfect. The pool was so so so amazing. We spent one whole day just lying around reading poolside. They even provide pool noodles.\n\nThe restaurant is delicious. Their chef is phenomenal. The wait staff is so so sweet. We kept trying to tip our waitress but she wouldn't accept a tip (even though we know this may be a cultural norm we had a hard time with it -- everyone else in Bali accepted our tips and the wait staff at the Villas Tejakula seemed like they weren't aloud to take a tip). But we really wanted to tip our server because she was so great. I hope she gets a bonus. We forget her name, but she was thin with a young baby (about 15 months). She was so wonderful. \n\nOur only criticism that the villas are advertised as \"private\" (we rented both bedrooms -- each villa has two), but the staff comes in at minimum three times a day. Once at night to lower the blinds (we requested to have this not done because we woke up twice very very early (1:30 am and 4am) for excursions and I was nearly sleep walking and walked right into them). They come in again to clean the pool and a third time in the morning to raise the blinds. Also, the manager came in with a few guys to check something with the power. Had we been sunbathing topless or something that would've been a bit uncomfortable. Once I was in the kitchen grabbing a drink and I turn around and someone was tending to the plants - no warning at all. The privacy thing is my only complaint, but everything else was absolutely wonderful. We would highly suggest the Villas leaving a \"do not disturb\" door knob sign for the guests to use on the main villa gate.\n\nThe location: Tejakula is less touristy than Seminyak and Ubud, which makes it a wonderful getaway from all the hustle and bustle. Wayan and her husband are wonderful hosts. Wayan communicated very well in helping us setup our excursions and activities. During our time there we coordinated the following through her:\n\n1. Dolphin boat tour -- a sunrise tour on a Balinese boat... We actually saw Dolphins! It was fun. Driver included too. \n2. Fishing tour - Wayan coordinated a couple hour fishing tour on a traditional Balinese boat -- we ended up spending most of it chasing a group of whales. It was incredible. There was even a baby whale. Our captain didn't speak English well, but we didn't mind at all. He was so nice and did everything to keep up with the whales. Even after the whales left the area we caught a fish!!! \n3. Mt. Batur climb - our favorite part of the whole trip! Left at 1:30 am and returned around 11am. Wayan's driver is awesome and very nice, and the climber guide was excellent. It was a private guide, so we weren't lumped in with some big group. We didn't have to take breaks and he showed us the back side of the mountain, which had hardly any tourists. Then our driver took us to a great restaurant that had an amazing view of Mt. Batur. \n\nOverall I would HIGHLY recommend the Villas Tejakula. During our time in Bali we also stayed at a 5-star resort in Nusa Dua, and the Villas Tejakula was nicer than that resort. If the remote location is stopping you from staying, don't let it! Tejakula is wonderful and you can easily access many activities with Wayan's help. ",

From the moment we arrived, Wayan was warm, friendly and welcoming. Wayan and Budi manage the Villas and are a wealth of information and very hospitable, as are all the staff. The Villas themselves are 2 big bedrooms with a common area that has a couple of lounges, coffee table, dining table and kitchen facilities in the middle with nice touches such as playing cards and books. Each villa has a beautiful pool to enjoy. Each day staff tidied the bedrooms and common areas while we enjoyed breakfast under the palm trees right in front of the sea where we snorkelled! Food is good with a variety of Indonesian and western style meals, the spring rolls are particularly good. We had massages and facials in the spa hut which were great! Budi took us to a waterfall one day and was very informative on our walk about the different plants along the path. We also went out on the Villas Tejakula's traditional boat for a look up and down the coast. A great place if you are looking to relax and rejuvenate. We will definitely be back! ",

To be able to snorkel right in front of the villas was a remarkable experience being right on the coral reef, very secluded with very few tourists in the area was an easy way back into the Bali I remember.",

Both Budi and Wayan (the couple who owns the villas) were very helpful and it was a pleasure to speak with them every day and share experiences. They made us feel at home and did the utmost to show us their country and way of living. The villas are of a very high standard with an eye for detailed luxury. We had a private pool which was perfectly clean and maintained. The whole staff is involved, very polite and friendly. Each member of the staff and cleaning personnel gives you the feeling that you're more than just a tourist. We will definitely go back to enjoy the food at the seaside.",

The location at the sea, the bathroom, the room it self, the swimming pool to share with your neighbors if you don't rent the whole villa, everything was great!\nThe breakfast was delicious, so was the other food. \nThe only down side for us was that our neighbors turned out to be the owners of the place. They moved in a day later and my son kindly said to the woman that we had put some drinks in our shared fridge and that they were no part of the honesty bar. She replied in a very unfriendly way\n 'I know how it works, I own the place'! \nWe first thought we must have misunderstood, because if you own the place why would you speak in such an unfriendly way to one of your customers. But later the man came to us and told us the same, in a normal way though. \nOther then this I would recommend the villas, and the couple that run the place, because obviously the owners just invested, are great.",

The staff is very friendly, and the hospitality by Wayan and Boody is unique.\nWe were very pleased with local trip to Les waterfall, dolphin tour at Lovina and hot springs nearby Lovina.\nA great view to the sea, however no beach. Shorkeling is likewise dependant on clear water. \nTransportation from airport/Kuta takes time and a stay could be combined with Kintamani tour, Lovina and/or another villa, fx Sanglung as we did.",

              "text": "My wife and I went to Bali and stayed at 9 locations across 10 nights, with the stays ranging from $31 to $224 a night. The Villas was our favorite location, as it was the most well maintained, well thought out placed we stayed at. This was the only location that looked just as good as the photos and wasn't misleading. The lounge was great, clean, very spacious with relaxing music and cards. The room was large, and very clean. The location had easy access to the water, and a restaurant with amazing spring rolls. They provide scooters for you to rent, which we took to danu batur and to other areas nearby. Both owners were great to talk to, friendly, and wanted to address any concerns you may have. I don't see what else you could want, and it was one of the highlights of our trip.",

              "text": "We were looking for a place along the North side of Bali to be closer to Mount Batur for trekking.  We read all the positive reviews here on Trip Advisor, so we booked 3 days.  Wow, everybody was right and then some.  Wayan and Budi were perfect hosts along with all the excellent staff.  Once we arrived, Wayan was waiting for us to show us around our villa and the grounds.  There are 4 separate villas with 2 rooms in each one.  We were lucky to be there when only 1 other couple was there, so we have a whole villa to ourselves.  No need to share multiple additional pictures, as the ones in here and in other reviews show off the place very well.  The rooms were well appointed with all the little things one notices in well kept establishments.  I loved the rain shower in the bath!!  The pool was perfect sized for lounging in and temperature was just a perfect contrast to the heat outside.  There are a couple sitting areas in the villa, both shaded and in the sun, depending on what you are wanting.  Honest bar, mosquito repellent, and bottled water dispenser are just a few extras that made you feel at home.  The massages were great, as we had them each of the 3 days we were there.  Food was terrific and location next to the beach for romantic outdoor dinners was something we will remember forever.  Even though we don't travel to Bali all the time, we will definitely have this on our list to spend even longer at next time.  Don't hesitate to book, just do it.  You won't be let down, but probably, will have your expectations met and then some.  To Wayan and Budi and all the staff, thanks again for sharing your oasis with us.  We will never forget our time here!!",

The staff were amazing, Wayan and her husband were very attentive and the place is absolutely beautiful down to the last detail. I was sick the first night and Wayan and her husband were so caring and concerned and found me a doctor who was excellent. The food was amazing. We also had a couples massage- the sounds of the waves hitting the coast made it heavenly. Because the other room in our villa was vacant, we had the whole pool area and kitchen to ourselves. Highly recommended if you'd like a romantic, luxurious, and tranquil escape! ",

The villas are very well designed, comfortable and quite private guaranteeing fantastically relaxing experience. The staff at the resort are very friendly and helpful going out of their way to make our stay comfortable.\nWe also bought some tours from the resort, a yoga class, massage and mani/pedi. We enjoyed all of them. The best thing was that the tours were quite flexible and could accommodate our preferences easily.   I will definitely go back!",

They have one bedrooms that share a small pool, and the other room was empty so we had our own villa.  Wayan, the manager, was super attentive and we always felt pampered. \n\nThe rooms were spectacular and the privacy of the villas we unique.  Great value for the money and I would recommend to anyone wanting to get away.",

              "text": "Stayed here for 1 night only (unfortunately) but thoroughly enjoyed the stop-over. We had exclusive use of an enormous 2-bedroom Villa with its own pool. It was completely self-contained and utterly private. The restaurant was situated near the beach in a beautiful location with a great view. We went snorkeling on the nearby reef and there's a diving school next door for those interested.\n\nWe wanted fish for dinner but were, very honestly, told that they only had freshly frozen fish. We thought this was perfectly ok. However a few hours later we were offered 2 freshly caught fish (wahoo, we think) that were deliciously barbecued for us later that evening. Full points for that one, guys.\n\nThe place was extremely well maintained, the gardens and surrounds pristine and beautiful. The one BIG thing I noticed is that the Villas, the restaurant and the kitchen were not just spotlessly clean - they were METICULOUSLY clean. They clearly put a lot of work and effort into the place and it is worth a visit, and a longer stay, if you're in the area.\n\nAnother win for us. Good value, superior accommodation, great service, relaxed and enjoyable.",

If you're looking for quality, attention to detail, in a quiet & unspoilt location, then I challenge you to get better than The Villas Tejakula !\nI was lucky enough to have 5 nights here & I can honestly say I cannot find a single negative to say about The Villas - a very rare thing !\nFrom booking directly with Wayan ( who I had many friendly & informative emails as I was travelling from England ), to departing for my second destination in Ubud, the whole process went seamlessly ! As a 62 year old woman ( yes used to travelling alone all over the world ), this fact in itself means a great deal. My arrival in Bali was in the late hours, which meant I had to stay in a hotel near the airport. As prearranged, Wayan sent a car & driver to pick me up & I had a very comfortable ride to The Villas, via the route of my choice. The welcome when I arrived was wonderful - like joining the family !\nThe actual villas are out of this world. I was extremely lucky to have the whole double villa to myself - no sharing the pool, outside area, or kitchen/living area.\nWhat impressed me especially was the attention to detail in everything - the design & layout of the whole place ( small but beautifully formed ), from the pretty gardens, walkways, seating areas, to the night time lighting. Everything was so well thought out & immaculately kept !\nHere are some examples of the finer points of attention to detail at The Villas -\nDaily filled water jug & glasses in the bedroom ( also bottled water )\nBoxes of tissues everywhere ( when I arrived it was with a heavy cold & what a blessing they were )\nSuper effective a/c, fans ( ceiling & freestanding )\nThe wifi was amazing wherever I was & so quick\nGood quality soaps & shampoo\nCd/iPod player, TV & DVD ( there was soft music playing when I arrived )\nCold glasses kept in the freezer with plenty of ice cubes ready\nA large jug of cold water always in the fridge along with the mini bar things\nBooks to read, playing cards, note books & pens\nCandles, mosquito coils, clothing drying rails\nOutside shower, large soft towels, comfortable sun beds in & out of the shade\nSnorkelling equipment, tailor made trips, massages\nThe food is fresh & beautifully cooked & presented\nI really could go on & on !\nAll this & I haven't even gotten round to mentioning the staff who are just wonderful - kind, friendly, extremely efficient & honestly make you feel part of their family. To say that they care about you & only want the very best for you, would be an understatement ! They take great pride in giving you the very best experience possible !\nTo anyone going to The Villas I unreservedly recommend to you !\nTo everybody at The Villas, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for such a fantastic stay !\n\n",

The place itself is gorgeous - beautifully presented accommodation (with your own pool if you're lucky enough to get a whole villa to yourself - which we were!) and exquisite gardens.  It is the perfect place for anyone just wanting to relax as there really is nothing to do but to unwind.  \n\nWe took advantage of the well priced massages available at the spa and spent a great deal of time swimming in our own pool, snorkelling just out the front of the resort, lazing on the sun-lounges overlooking the ocean and eating at the restaurant, which serves amazing food! Of course, if you want to go on some day trips, there are plenty of excursions available that the very helpful staff will organise for you (we went out on a boat at sunrise to see dolphins, went to a nearby waterfall and did a longer trip (about 90mins drive each way) to a very pretty sandy beach).  \n\nThe staff are incredibly friendly and really go out of their way to make sure your stay is perfect.   The managers, Wayan and Budi, treat you as if you're part of their own family - they are just so lovely.  Weda, who works in the restaurant, is so kind that she took us to her temple in another village so we could watch a ceremony, in which it turned out, her uncle was dancing!  She and Wayan helped us get ready by providing traditional Balinese clothes that must be worn in the temple and took us there on the back of their motor scooters.  The next day, Weda picked me up on her scooter again and took me to the early morning food market with her where she does her shopping.  It was a great experience and I saw fruit and vegetables there that I'd never seen before!\n\nThank you so much Wayan, Budi, Weda, and all the team for one of the most relaxing and friendly holidays I've ever been on.  We will definitely be back.",

The villas are private with a large bedroom and massive bathroom, a shared kitchen and pool (if there\u2019s someone in the accommodation at the other end of the villa) that is large and airy \u2013 overall fabulous. \n\nWayan, Budi, Weda and all of the staff made our stay so enjoyable, organising viewing sunrise and dolphins from an outrigger canoe, a waterfall tour, a day at White Sand beach, massages and a visit to the local temple for the full moon celebrations; dressed in traditional clothing.\n\nAnd when we returned to the villas, there was snorkelling off the reefs that are only 20 metres away and lovely meals in the restaurant where the food was great and beer and wine reasonably priced.\n\nThoroughly recommend as a different Bali holiday \u2013 so relaxing, yet entertaining and enjoyable.",

Villas Tejakula is a beautiful respite in the north eastern part of Bali.  It is a quiet part of the island - exactly what we were looking for!  The villas are exquisitely decorated, comfortable, and spotlessly kept.  The grounds are stunning and staff are attentive, yet not intrusive. We were able to snorkel and dive right off the resort shore.  We did hike to a waterfall and visit a local textile in the village.  But mainly we enjoyed the food (try the BBQ ribs), massages, private pool, and beach of Villas Tejalika.  Resort managers, Wayan and Budy treated us like friends and even invited us to a ceremony at their temple, which we loved.  This was so worth the three hour drive from the airport!  i wouldn't stay anywhere else in Bali! Unless it was at Villa Saraswati, owned by the same couple, Robin and Wayne! ;))",

              "text": "I was referred to The Villas Tejakula by their owners who happened to also own Villa Saraswati in Ubud. It wasn't as if I had a ticket out of Bali yet, so of course, I extended my stay to check out northern Bali. The ride was all prepared for me and all I had to do was get in the car. So up and down the mountain I went and around the volcano and through some quaint villages. The journey itself was memorable.\n\nBut the destination is even more memorable. The shared space consisted of a couple of patio and lounge sets facing the ocean surrounded by coconut trees and beautifully landscaped garden. Do fall asleep here in between rounds of snorkeling just off the coast (all equipment provided by the villa)\n\nI stayed at Villa Ganesha. Honestly, I have never stayed at anywhere so grand, so I may be bias, but this is luxury at its finest. There are actually 2 bedrooms at this villa but as I am solo, I only occupied one. The room is enormous with a pitched, beautifully layered ceiling and a huge comfortable bed. The bathroom area connects to the bedroom and likewise enormous with dual sinks.\n\nThere is also a kitchen area with lounging and dining area which I didn't really use because, well, lounging and patio sets by the ocean. \n\nLet's not forget the private pool. No joke, you can do laps in this pool. I pretty much lived it that pool for 3 days. (when I am not lounging by the ocean)\n\nThe managers Wayan and Budi were welcoming and organized all outside excursions (boat rides to see some dolphins and trip to the waterfall). Their staff attentive but not intrusive.\n\nFinally, the spring rolls at the restaurant are amazing. I think I will miss it the most (and I am Asian)",

              "text": "Upon arriving at this amazing location I was blown away by the stunning accommodation provided by The Villas Tejakula.   Right on the beachfront it was fantastic to have breakfast, lunch and dinner in their restaurant overlooking the beautiful gardens on the oceanfront.    A must do if it is the right time of year is an early morning cruise to see the Dolphins just off the coast and about 15 minutes from The Villas.   We could not believe just how many there were and we followed them for ages.   We also went to Les Waterfall which is close by and an easy walk, just the right amount of exercise to deal with the delicious breakfast and make way for lunch !  \nTheir Spa is also excellent and I can recommend a massage.  Snorkeling first thing in the morning before a late breakfast was amazing and so close to shore with water a great temperature and so many fish and so much coral to see. \nAll of the staff here are simply amazing and I could not fault anything at all about my stay apart from the fact that it was simply not long enough.    Wayan and Budi, the Managers are the 2 most wonderful people I have ever met in a Resort and I look forward to seeing them again soon.    Do yourself a favour and make the effort to come and stay here - it is a remarkable place.",

Initially I was hesitant in travelling to a place I hadn't heard much of and that was so far out but there is not one regret, this place is stunning, the staff are amazing.\n\nWe stayed in the Villa Tirta. Luxurious down to the smallest details.  You walk in the the secure locked villa, with a private pool, shared kitchen and lounge area (which is large, spacious and immaculate). The rooms are beautiful, spacious, cool and the bathroom is a dream. \n\nThe staff catered to every need. We booked our tours through The Villas, after asking around locally, the prices are unbeatable and the standards of Wayan and Budhi are above all. \n\nWe did the Dolphin tour, which was to a different location than suggested by others (Lovina-which tends to be overcrowded). There were three other boats and three species of dolphins. It was quiet, peaceful and we were even provided with a beautiful fruit basket.\n\nWe ate almost all of our meals at the restaurant run by the Villa Warung Kelapa, not because it was convenient but because it was fantastic. We have some difficult dietary requirements which were all catered for. The staff even went to the markets after finding out our love of avocado for breakfast. Coconut milk was used to replace any dairy and all sugar was removed from the meals. The ribs are a must (12 hours notice must be given).\n\nThere is an onsite spa in a gorgeous little Balinese hut. Couples massages are available and you can even ask to have the massage out on the deck shares facing the ocean. \n\nIt was the most relaxing time I have ever spent away and I didn't want to leave.\n\nI would highly recommend this place to all of you're wishing to escape the rat race or you want a paradise and still keep in touch with family (wifi throughout the Villa and the grounds).\n",

              "text": "What a perfect spot. \n\nTejakula is so refreshingly peaceful and quiet away from the hustle and bustle of Southern Bali. \n\nThe location is beautiful as you will see from the photos and it is just as well kept and manicured as you see in the pictures. There is a reef to snorkel or fish on just 30m out from the resort. \n\nThe Villas themselves are gorgeous. So modern with a beautiful big bathroom, very comfortable bed and great air-conditioning. The private pool is so nice on a hot day and the ocean temperature is like a warm bath. The living area is so big and spacious and has everything you could possibly need and more. \n\nThe attention to detail from the staff is exceptional. Whether it be remembering your name and plans, remembering your favourite food (and catering for special requests) or helping you organise a day trip. The food in the restaurant is fantastic and they are so willing to cater for your every request. \n\nTejakula itself is fantastic. It isn't touristy at all so there isnt much in the way of shops or restaurants. There are still a few places where you can get a great massage though and at least one local warung that is clean and tidy. The local traditional markets are a great spot to buy some local fruit and produce very cheaply. Hire s scooter from The Villas very cheaply and go explore thevregion on your own. There are lots of tours to do be it seeing the temples, the mountains, the lakes, the volcano or even the hot springs. The staff ate super helpful organising it for you with very proffessional drivers and give great tips. Little things like providing you with a sarong to enter the temple with are always taken care of. Go out and see the dolphins, there are three different kinds and heaps of them. ",

              "text": "Everything about this place was perfect! \nWe chose to come here mainly for the fact that we thought it would be nice and quiet and for the snorkelling. \nYou could not ask for a nicer spot right on the beachfront. The place was beautifully thought out with great attention to all the little details. The beachfront gardens were beautiful with loungers laid out looking out to sea. A lovely spot for an evening drink while watching the sunset, before dinner in their amazing restaurant! All the food we had there was so delicious. The breakfast had lots of great options. And plenty of it! Loads of yummy things for lunch and we had some really good fish dinners. Especially the whole tuna which we shared with another couple one of the nights. And the black rice pudding! Unfortunately we weren't here long enough to try everything!\nAll the staff were so lovely. I was blown away with how friendly, happy and helpful everyone who we met was. Not just here, but in Bali in general! But especially here! You could not ask for nicer people to look after you than Wayan and Budi!\nThe accommodation here is unbelievable! There is a private pool and outdoor kitchen living area that you would usually share with another double room. We were lucky enough to get the whole area to ourselves! The pool area is gorgeous. With beautifully maintained plants and pool. The bed was enormous! And so comfy. Well air conditioned room. Immaculate bathroom.\nI am very grateful to my boyfriend for doing the research before hand and finding this beauty of a place! We really couldn't have asked for more.\n We were in Bali for 8 nights. We went to Ubud, Amed and then here. It wasn't too far to travel for such a short time. Its easy enough to find a taxi driver and they all seem to be excellent drivers!\n The pictures don't do it justice! You must go and see for yourself!",

              "text": "We had an outstanding and memorable 4-night stay. Why? For many reasons:\n\nFirst, the 2-bedroom villas with shared 10-metre pool and living-dining-kitchen area are truly luxurious in design and furnishing. Everything is new, high-quality and meticulously cared for. Great thought and taste went into the layout and comfort of the space. We loved the high-peaked ceilings in the AC-cooled bedroom and fan-and-fresh-air-cooled living-dining-kitchen. The king-sized bed is extremely comfortable. The kitchen area is well equipped should you choose to prepare yourself a meal; however, we gave it no thought, other than using the coffee provided: there was no point because the restaurant satisfied us entirely 3-times a day, every day. The pool and plants are impeccably maintained, and the outdoor art (as the indoor) is well chosen. Shade and sun are available all day in different areas of your private enclosure.\n\nSecond, the location of the property is ideal : walk down the steps directly to the ocean and a coral reef with a lovely variety of coral and small fish only a few metres away.\nDon't expect a sandy beach in these parts. The narrow beach at low tide consists of black pebbles and rocks and is exceptionally clean. The absence of sand was not an issue for us, as we came to snorkel - snorkelling gear is available (scuba gear and excursions can be organized metres away at a dive resort). We loved being away from the frenzy of south Bali, in this serene, under-touristed part of Bali. Our few outside activities included attending prayers one evening with the locals at the nearby Hindhu temple (very worthwhile - ask about it), visiting the early-morning locals' market, and wallking along the seawall to the East at at least one km. Other guests much enjoyed their scooter rental, trip to nearby Les Falls, massages and water excursion on the resort's beautiful jukung.\n\nThird, the comon grounds are beautifully vegetated with an attractive collection of trees and plants and are perfectly maintained by a gardener. There are several spots to sit and enjoy sun or shade, and a cooling breeze.\n\nFourth, as noted above, we so enjoyed the food prepared at the restaurant that we did not consider cooking ourselves nor investigating any other food options in thhe area. The breakfasts were extremely plentiful and generousWe ate lightly at lunch and found plenty of choices. Evening meals benefitted from the easy availability of fresh fish\n(e.g., tuna, squid, prawns, etc.) prepared in a variety of ways. \n\nFinally, owners Wayan and Budi, and every staff member went out of their way to make our stay a wonderful and special experience. They were friendly, helpful, caring, never intrusive and always eager and able to please.\n\nShould you be lucky enough to stay here (make it at least several days), you will remember it forever. Don't be put off by the distance from Denpasar or Ubud: let the Villas at Tejakula take care of the transportation. It is an enjoyable drive up, with many potential stops along the way.",

I have never been to this part of Bali before but know now that I have really missed out by not having done so.    The location on the beach is stunning, to go swimming and snorkeling on the wonderful coral reef just metres from the shore was an almost daily activity and almost like meditation.    Then there is the spa, what can I say but that there is nothing better than being pampered with a massage or facial and hearing the sound of the waves in the background.   The food here is amazing and without a doubt some of the best that I had in Bali and I have to mention just how clean everything is, from the kitchen in the waring to the Villas and their beautiful grounds.   They are now commencing small yoga classes on request and take the time to introduce you to the highlights of the area.    I just loved my time here and I will definitely be back.\n",

              "text": "This is my first ever review of a hotel I stayed in. \n\nUsually I am either not that fond of the hotel or I feel the rating is already correctly reflected on major sites, so writing a review is not worth the effort - not so with The Villas Tejakula. \n\nWe are a couple in our early thirties and love to travel, usually staying in 5* resorts. In order to see some of the main sights in northern Bali (lovina dolphins, kintamani, Mr batur sunrise trek etc), we tried to find a resort with similarly high standards but were unable to. I booked The Villas Tejakula as the only place with good ratings in the area, setting my expectations fairly low - and boy was I wrong!\n\nThe property itself is located in a village far away from tourists, in-between local shops and next to the ocean. The grounds are beautiful and very well maintained. The property has a common area with a little restaurant and sun loungers next to the sea, as well as individual villas with 2 BR, a big outside living room / kitchen area and a private pool, which you will share if booking a room or have to yourself if booking a villa. The rooms themselves are really nice (nicer than most 5* properties I stayed at recently), and the pool area is gorgeous!\n\nWhile the hotel itself already has lots of great qualities (great facilities, massage, food, snorkelling), the best part about is are its hosts Budi and Wayan and the rest of the staff - they have done everything possible to make our stay as amazing as possible, and we cannot thank them enough. \n\nThis morning for example, I wanted to do the sunrise trekking of mount batur; Budi was waiting for me in the car at 2.30 am, with sandwiches, fruits and water, ready to go. His wife had organised a guide, and while I was busy trekking with the guide, Budi waited for me in the car for 5 hours, to make sure I came back home safely. When I got back to the villa, I went for a nap, only to find Budi offering fresh fish they had organised for all guests interested for dinner. \n\nI have never felt so welcome. Can only recommend to anyone stopping by this amazing place!\n\n",

              "text": "We stayed there in August for 5 nights\nThe place is very well taken care of. Communal area, garden, restaurant etc are very tidy and well maintained.\nThe garden and the restaurant is just in front of the sea which offers amazing and relaxing views. It is also great for diving (there is a dive center next door operated by germans) you can just walk in and manage to reach great diving spots without using the boats to reach them - great dive are guaranteed among the best in Bali.\nThe beach is made of rocks which is beautiful but don't expect a sandy beach. The Villas provide rock/corail shoes, fins etc\u2026.\nThe Villas are all the same, very spacious with a very nice shower room and offer one swimming pool for two villas (with a large extensive patio with kitchen, fridge etc\u2026.) We were lucky as we had the communal area only for us for 4 nights which results of us having our own private swimming pool.\nMy advice would be to book two villas with friends or another couple to fully enjoy it - that would be the perfect way to enjoy the pool, drinking something nice around it and chatting.\nThe Villas also offers various of excursion but be aware there are a bit far (+- 2 hours with the car one-way - even if the sightseeing are close in KM +- 60, the traffic and road are pretty mad in Bali) We did the waterfall close by which is a 2 hours journey max (driving + walking) and totally worth it as the waterfall is very high.\nThere is also a local market 30min by foot which is really worth seeing to get a glimpse of the local way of life.\nThe Villas offer massage treatment which are great value for money (they were very cheap in comparison to Europe standard and even in comparison to Bali standard- and quite nice) we did treatment everyday.\n\nThe only down side would be for me the lack of food options around the Villas so you quickly end up eating there everyday at their restaurant Warung (which is ok but not fantastic but the price are good value)\n\nThe service at all level was very good, friendly and staff always try to make our stay the nicest possible - we thank them for their very kind hospitality\n\nIn conclusion, we had a very relaxing stay and if you're looking for an escape from bustling Ubud or Semiyiak in a more authentic part of the island, this is a great option. Also a great dive option.\nI would definitely recommend it for a long w-e trip or a stop over of few days in a trip around Bali!",

              "text": "My partner Emma and I had a delightful stay at the Villas during our recent trip to Bali.  As soon as we arrived, we were made to feel welcome by Wayan, Budi and the whole staff - who are always ready to help, whilst also giving you space to relax and unwind.  \n\nThe villas themselves are superb.  They are only a year old and easily the standard of a luxury hotel.  We were lucky and had a whole villa to ourselves, with plenty of space to relax, sunbathe, read and a private pool to swim in.  Each kitchen has a fridge stocked with beer, water and soft drinks - and much needed ice cold glasses to keep them cold! The bedrooms are extremely spacious with very comfortable beds and the shower in the bathroom is very good (makes all the difference!)\n\nThe restaurant is set in beautiful, well maintained gardens - and the food served was superb.  It was genuinely some of the best food we had in Bali - from fresh whole tuna BBQ'd especially for us to delicious chicken salads.  We didn't even consider eating elsewhere as it was so good!\n\nThere are plenty of options for things to do nearby and Wayan and Budi were more than happy to talk through them with us.  Budi arranged for our sunrise climb of Mt Batur, and also a trip for us to visit the Royal Baths on the trip back to Ubud - well worth a stop if you're going the scenic route.\n\nWe had a wonderful time at the Villas - and look forward to going back again!  Thank you Wayan, Budi and the whole team for making it so special for us!",

              "text": "I was fortunate to stay in Villa Sawaswati in Ubud for four days and then took up their online offer of one of their \"hot deals\" to stay at the Villas Tejakula. I was certainly not disappointed.  The whole trip was an enormous success and I got to see some of the real Bali.  The northern coast is so different from the craziness of Ubud.  The people are lovely, the setting superb.  Thanks to a foot injury, I could not walk far - at the Villas everything I could possibly want was within a few metres.  There is a lovely outdoor warung serving delicious food and a spa on site for massage and other therapies.  The Villas are totally private and the swimming pool and set up of the rooms of the highest standard - I would have expected nothing less from such exacting owners of both places. The wifi worked very well and I was able to stay in touch, plus listen to favorite radio or tv programs on my iPad. My book consumption went up immeasurably!  If you want total relaxation with gracious service and a beautiful setting this is the place. Can't wait to go back. Highly recommended.",

              "text": "Our secure complex consisted of two rooms which shared a pool and open air kitchen / dining area. As we were the only guests we had exclusive use of the whole area which was amazing, so relaxing and peaceful it was difficult to leave the confines of the villa. The villas are separated from the warang and ocean front by a small road, but there is virtually no traffic and whilst sitting around your pool you can still hear the waves from the ocean. The villa itself has all modern amenities with a good quality bed and shower. \nAll the staff are extremely friendly and helpful without being overbearing and in your face which could have been an issue with us being the only guests. The food was good quality and plentiful (particularly the breakfast). They are more than happy to adapt things from the menu and we had fresh seafood cooked on the BBQ twice during our stay. I also had a Balinese massage which I would recommend. \nAs we had toured round Bali before our stay we were happy to spend most of our time just relaxing in the villa. They did organise our sunrise trek up Mount Batur and we took short walks into the village and along the ocean to see the numerous fishing boats. We also used their transportation service and felt very safe in their hands.\nIf you want a small 5* retreat on the ocean  away from the hustle and bustle of the larger resorts I would thoroughly recommend a stay here. We felt everything from the cost of the accommodation, food, trips, etc was all excellent value for money. \nThank you Wayan, Budi and all your staff for a lovely end to our stay in Bali. ",

The villas are amazing and the bathroom and shower just delightful. Sitting by the ocean on a deck chair just looking out is so peaceful and relaxing. The gardens are meticulously maintained, the whole experience is just tranquil and pure relaxation. The food is wonderful it is so fresh with wonderful flavours. We would have loved to go snorkeling unfortunately the ocean was a little to rough. All the staff were very friendly and obliging. It was the best place to end our holiday to Bali. Thank you Dean & Robin and all the wonderful staff.",

The Villa with the pool are totally clean, modern with a nice balinese touch! The private Beach is wonderfull for snorkelling, my opinion the best spot we went snorkeling at Bali. The Food is delicious and everyone does his best to fulfil your every wish and whim. We really didn't want to leave this amazing place, but had already booked the next place, otherwise we would have stayed longer. All this little details at the Villas are so wonderfull and the hole Team seems to be a big Family! The Breakfast is just amazing! A big thanks to Budi, who picked us up from Amed and Wayan for the organization and the wonderful stay at the Villas Tejakula. Your team and your place is amazing, I really hope that a lot of people will visit you! Guys you really have to go there, you can relax at the beach or your pool; you can rent a moto to go to Danau Batur or Danau Bratan; or you book one of this amazing trips which are offered from Wayan and Budi! Really everything ist perfect at the Villas Tejakula - we definitely will come back!",

Great place, beautiful surroundings, great room service and the best villas with a private pool. There was nothing around the villas so this is a place to stay in, by the pool with a Bintang. I also have to say that the rooms were really nicely decorated and you can tell from far away that this is all new.",

              "text": "The wow factor struck immediately on arrival and lasted the entire stay.  This is the movie-star luxury experience you've dreamed of.  A perfect honeymoon destination, romantic escape for couples or in fact perfect for anyone seeking relaxation in 5* luxury.  Just 4 private villas, each of which may be rented as a whole or as one of two individual bedroom suites with its own large and spectacular private bathroom - inside each villa's secluded walled garden, two bedroom suites (one at either end) are beautifully decorated and furnished, with high quality finish and immaculate cleanliness. The two suites share a private 10m pool, sundecks with shade should you prefer and a large open lounge sitting area.  Book the villa and its all yours, book a room and you may share the pool and sitting area with maximum one other.  In this case, the garden area is so spacious that there is plenty of privacy, with individual areas at either end alongside your own suite.  If you're lucky, you may get the whole villa to yourself anyway.  Between the villas and the ocean are the most immaculate, pretty tropical gardens in amongst a coconut grove - here you'll find the spa (the Balinese massage is a MUST) and the small restaurant, where every single meal we ate was beautifully presented, high quality and most importantly very tasty.  Wayan, Budi and their beautiful, small team of staff deliver at every opportunity...that gentle, attentive Balinese hospitality.  The attention to detail here raises the standard to the very highest, whether that be the frangipani petals scattered on our pool, the unlimited drinking water provided, the nightwatchman who lowers your extra blind to ensure absolute darkness and a good night sleep....or the fascinating leaf patterns in the concrete flooring.  For anyone itching to explore, there is great snorkelling just a few metres out front - a dive centre next door caters to divers, and Budi and Wayan offer a range of inexpensive daytours.  Ubud is only 2 hours drive, for example.  But we went nowhere ... and loved every minute !!",

              "text": "In selecting The Villas Tejakula, we were looking for three things: something very nice (luxurious, private, quiet, great food), within an hour's drive of northeastern Bali's main sites (volcanoes, waterfalls, snorkeling and diving spots, temples), and far removed from the chaos of Denpasar and southern Bali. The Villas are exactly what we hoped they'd be and hands down our best decision while traveling through Indonesia was to stay here! The two Indonesian proprietors, Budi and Wayan, as well as their lovely staff, were fun to be around, professional, efficient, and great conversationalists. My wife and I immediately felt right at home and always looked forward to our interactions with them. It's worth mentioning that, given that there are only eight rooms, at any one time the place is never busy and the staff always have time to accommodate your needs and wishes. The rooms themselves are amazing: modern, equipped, comfortable, great bathroom, no bugs, super clean, etc. We reserved both units (each villa has two units) for ourselves, which was perfect because we had the huge common living area and swimming pool all to ourselves. If you can splurge, it's absolutely worth it to secure the extra, private space. Plus, two friends of ours decided to stay in our other unit the last two nights, and it was great to have the flexibility to offer them that option. The property itself is very well attended (Budi's brother the gardener does an amazing job). While there is no beach at the property - or on northern and especially north-eastern Bali for that matter - due to the volcanic explosions of decades past that left the beaches strewn with black rocks, The Villas Tejakula have built their property right to the water and with amazing views of the coast. The snorkeling in front of the property is arguably the second-best we encountered in Bali (after Amed) and the best parts are literally 30 meters off shore right in front of Warung Kelapa, the restaurant contained within the property itself. Plus, you're a 40-minute drive from the shipwreck at Tulamben, and a 55-minute drive from the nicest beaches and amazing diving and snorkeling of Amed. Finally, the food at Warung Kelapa is great and varied and each day we tried something different. In terms of considerations before booking your stay, four in particular come to mind: 1) the wi-fi, while free, is slow and intermittent; 2) with the exception of the neighboring hotel literally 10 meters from The Villas Tejakula, there are few restaurant or hotel options in the region; 3) the wine in Bali is pretty bad and I recommend you bring your own; and 4) make sure The Villas Tejakula find you local drivers, which they're happy to do at a very reasonable price for a daily rate, that know the region, speak English, and can ably recommend sites to see and things to do along the way. Otherwise, I highly recommend: Sekumpul Waterfalls, the Tulamben shipwreck (great snorkeling or diving, either way), diving and snorkeling at Amed Beach, the Surya Indigo women's art cooperative, and simply driving a scooter along the road from beach to beach to find a nice view and some great fried fish.",

It consists of 8 rooms in four 2-bedroom villas, each with a private pool and living area. You may share your villa with other guests, or you may be lucky enough to have it to yourself. Even if shared it is a wonderful setup. \n\nThe hotel is on the ocean with views to the horizon. Decent snorkeling right from the doorstep. And the staff will arrange any excursion you can dream up, and offer plenty of suggestions from fishing to trekking to sightseeing. \n\nThe onsite restaurant is great. We were there 3 days and felt no need to search out any place else to eat. All meals were excellent and a few were spectacular. \n\nThe staff is exceptional, warm and friendly without hovering. The hotel is only a year old and beautiful. There are no discordant notes, the art and furnishings are elegant. No weeds, no trash on the beach, nothing to criticize. \n\nIt's not a place for everyone though. It's a bit remote. If you want to go out in the evening, there's not really any place to go. But if you want to sit on the oceanside, or with your feet in your private pool, as you watch the stars come out, it's just perfect. \n\nWe have traveled a lot, and The Villas Tejakula stands out as exceptional.

There are just 4 high quality villas each with two rooms separated by an open kitchen area along side a private pool. We booked the entire villa Baruna for our family of 4.\nWe quickly got to know the friendly staff who helped us with local information, taught us some Balinese and even bought interesting fruit from the market for us to try. \nWe went snorkelling and fishing in the villa boat as well as off the black pebble beach.\nIn Tejakula we came across a Balinese funeral ceremony and followed the procession down to the beach. We played with the Balinese children while we waited for the burning ceremony.\nThere is little organised tourism in the area. We visited the Sekumpul waterfall and ate in a local warung and the adjacent resort one night. We brought fresh fish from the market and cooked it in our villa. We also had great massages in the newly opened onsite spa. Wayan and Budi invited us to attend a big ceremony at their local temple and lent us sarongs, sashes and head wear to attend.\n\nHighly recommended stay in the quieter north east if Bali.\n\nPS if driving from Ubud don't go via the",

This is a great place to go on a honeymoon, to rest and relax or to snorkel and dive. There is a reef right in front of the Villas.\nThe owners are Australian (Robin and Dean), while the managers are Balinese (Wayan and Budi). Every last detail has been addressed in each villa. The decor is stunning, and every amenity available (right down to pool noodles!). There is a restaurant on-site (run by the same people) with excellent food. \nThe atmosphere is very family-like. We had many great chats with the owners and managers. When we arrived we were ill with Bali Belly. They took wonderful care of us and sent toast and rice from the restaurant at no charge to us. It was a great place to recover, although the closest pharmacy was an hour away (if traveling in Bali, don't underestimate the power of a bacterial intestinal bug and make sure you come equipped with the appropriate medications). When I was finally able to eat normal food, the restaurant (Warung Kelapa) made a palatable dish just for me (pesto), and then added it to the menu!\nThe beach is a rocky, black sand beach. There are beach chairs on the property where you can look out at the Bali Sea. Each villa also has a cute and clean pool. We enjoyed walking on the beach and engaging with the local children who are adorable. They will willingly pose for pictures and practice their few English phrases with you.\nIf you want to see more than the Bali tourist traps, I highly recommend a trip to the north!!",

We stayed as a group of 4 and really did not want to leave. After travelling around Bali for a few weeks we chose this as our final destination, best choice we made! \nWe were looked after for the entire stay by Wayan and Budi who went above and beyond when we needed a little help with a few things and we can't thank them enough! There is a fantastic group of people working at the villas and we really could not find one bad thing to say. The food is also delicious and we are there most days after having some terrible food at other places not too far away. \nIt was also great to talk to the owners about how that started up the villas and the snorkelling which is great just a few metres off the beach. Budi also organised a few trips for us which were great. I would definitely recommend going on the dolphin sightseeing trip. \nI would defiantly stay here again next time we visit Bali and would not hesitate to tell friends visiting about this hidden gem \nThank you so much for making our stay enjoyable! \nKatie \n\n",

              "text": "Wow! We travelled around Bali (stayed at 5 star hotels and other airbnb villas all over the island) and without a doubt this accommodation was the best. The staff were fantastic, by the end of our stay we felt like family and it felt very sad to leave. The villa itself was stunning, we booked the whole villa so we had it to ourselves (which we'd recommend) such great attention to detail, even down to a music playlist provided and fairly priced drinks and snacks. The pool was the perfect temperature, the villa and grounds were meticulously clean and you felt so well looked after. This village in Tejakula felt like the 'real' Bali, very few tourists and it was such a pleasure seeing the day to day life of the locals (particularly the school children and the early morning market). We snorkeled in the sea in front of the villa and in Tulamben near by, lots of coral and the USA Liberty ship wreck really blew us away! Budi took us to the waterfall which was magical, you must go. The food was fantastic, lots of fresh fish caught that day. We both had excellent (and great value!) spa treatments which were so luxurious with the sound of the birds and sea just outside! We never go back to the same place twice but I have a suspicion that we might, one day, end up back at the Villas Tejakula! Thank you so much for everything Wayan, Budi and the whole team, you were all so lovely. When it's raining in busy London we will remember beautiful Tejakula and your stunning villas.",

We are a family with 13 years old son and occupied one Villa which consists of two spacey bedrooms together with bathrooms, an open-air Living-Dining-Kitchen and a private pool/garden. The Villa is surrounded by walls and fences and security/privacy is 100% guaranteed so we can even swim naked! Hospitality, services, food, beach and all are amazing. One additional bonus point is that a diving center is located at just next door and our boy successfully completed a Junior Open Water Diver course (4 day session). Going back to Bali and staying in this facility again is definitely one of my Bucket List items. Wayan and Budi, I love you guys! Dean, Robyn, thank you for your hospitality!",

Having intentionally chosen this out of the way place so that we could unwind from our busy lives back home, we were not to be disappointed. As soon as we arrived we knew we were going to do just that.  We were shown to our beautiful private villa and pool and were completely amazed at how beautiful and private it was.  The rooms are very spacious with comfortable king size beds, and big semi-outdoor bathrooms with double sinks.  Each villa has a lovely outdoor living area for relaxing, enjoying a beer, or reading a book, not to mention its own beautiful private pool and sun lounges.   Everything has been thought of for your comfort: from the fridge stacked with refreshments, to the lovely big towels, to reading material and a stack of cards to amuse you during a lazy afternoon.   The staff are vey friendly and always happy to help.  All meals are eaten at the onsite \u2018Warung\u2019 (restaurant) with beautiful views of the ocean and the immaculately manicured gardens. The food is delicious and lovingly prepared; the breakfast highlight being the tasty banana pancake and the dinner highlight being the most amazing salt and pepper squid, followed by the signature coconut pancakes.  Thank you to the owners Robyn and Dean who made us feel so welcome.  A spa was in construction during our stay and once this is finished this place will be the ultimate in relaxation.   If you are looking for peace and tranquillity, privacy and a place simply to unwind, this is the place to go.",

It was pleasantly much more than I expected. The staff were beyond excellent. Provided me with true Bali memories including an invitation to a local traditional wedding, knowledge of the local language, culture and village, great massages at my villa, and lasting freindships. The host were attentive to our needs. The quality of these new villas were impressive, surrounded by wonderful landscaping, great snorkeling right off the beach weather permitting,  restful peace and quiet away from the usual tourist hustle. If you are looking for great value and relaxation while in Bali, look no further.",

During our stay, there's no other guest in the other room. So we can own the whole facilities in the villa. The room is very new and clean. The environment is quiet and cozy. You can enjoy the ocean and jungle atmosphere at the same time. \nIn front of the villas, there's a snorkelling spot. It's better to go to snorkel in the morning since the water is cleaner. There are many big coral reefs in Angel Canyon. We also go to snorkel in Tulamben, you can see the ship wreck and many fish and coral reefs. It's about 30 minutes drive.\nThe staffs are very kind and helpful, especially Budi and Wayan. With their hospitality, we don't have to worry about anything. We really enjoy everything in the villas Tejakula. Definitely will come back again.",

I don't think I have ever been so blown away by a hotel as much as this one. It truly is jaw droppingly amazing and I half expected someone to come along and say 'no, only joking, you're down the road aways,' \n\nWe had the two bedroom villa with private pool as we were a family. This would also be perfect for two couples traveling together as the bedrooms are at opposite ends of the villa divided by an open air living/dining area with a fully fitted kitchen, for those of you who wish to cook the fish you caught earlier in the day presumably...\n\nAs commented earlier, the photos don't do it justice, which just makes it that more special when you are confronted with the reality.\n\nWayan, the manager is an absolute gem, as are the rest of the staff.

Everything about these villas are perfect...they are both spacious and beautiful. Our children swam constantly in the private swimming pool inside our own villa, and snorkelled in the calm ocean directly in front of us for most of the day. Although there are many sights nearby including waterfalls and markets, we were so comfortable we didn't leave the premises! Thank you for an unforgettable holiday!",

The quality, beauty of the villas are way beyond what the pictures on the web let you imagine. Additionally the place is brand new and spotless, and each villa offers lots of space whether in the bedroom or in covered sitting areas (with kitchen corner with coffee etc..) or by the pool.  It has a garden along the sea from where you can directly go snorkelling or diving.  We did a couple of dives and it was better than I expected with great corals (check out the \"coral canyon\") and some interesting activity on the micro side. The food at the restaurant was very good (excellent desserts and home made bread) and that was a nice experience after the crap food we had in Tulamben. In the end I felt this is a perfect place for relaxing vacations and taking a good break (while enjoying a few easy dives). As a matter of fact as it is only 35 to 40 minutes from Tulamben I wished we had stayed there longer and visited Tulamben only a day or two for the Liberty dive.",

              "text": "After staying in Ubud twice, I thought it was time to explore a little bit more of Bali. There is no place more serene and private than Tejakula. A hidden haven in the middle of the northern coast of Bali. \n\nYou won't believe your eyes when you are handed the keys and walk inside the Villa. You'll be greeted with a massive bedroom with an unbelievably comfortable king size bed. Adjacent to the bedroom is a large bathroom (twice the size of my bedroom back home!) with an open shower, toilet and twin vanity units. The way the bathroom is designed is with cloudy glass on the back of the shower and then an open part of the wall near the roof - it gives the feeling of showering outside when you can see the sun streaming through the cloudy glass and open wall while still maintaining complete privacy. \n\nNext comes an open-living kitchen and living area that is completely open to your own private pool. the kitchen allows you to do your own cooking (if you so desire - there is an amazing restaurant less than a minute walk from your Villa that can be charged straight to your room!), a large hand crafted wooden table and lounge chairs. This is where you can see the attention to detail put into your room. A large 18L fresh water bottle sits on the bench for you to refill your own water at your convenience (and the 18L will be replaced when you finish it - no need to pay for water!!), complimentary tea, coffee, biscuits and sweets (replenished daily), ice and cold glasses that are refilled and replaced daily and your own full-size fridge - stocked with treats that can be purchased for very reasonable prices or bring your own.\n\nIn your own private pool and garden you have reclining chairs and a chair and table set and a superb, inviting pool. At night this area lights up with strategically placed lighting - sit under the stars or back in your open living area admiring from afar.\n\nThis place is for you if you want a place to relax in uninterrupted beauty. However, this is also a place for you if you like outdoors and exploring (or perhaps traveling with a mix of both styles of people). The Villas have a custom-built boat that is highly comfortable and sturdy. You can go out fishing with local fisherman (this was a highlight of my trip - a trip out to the fishing farms with a local fisherman and guide in the beaming sun fishing for fresh local Mahi Mahi or Tuna) or take a trip along the coastline. There are also a large number of tours available, Bali's best snorkelling only a couple hundred metres to the west (absolutely breathtaking!), waterfalls only a quick scoot away.\n\nThe Villas also include a large completely open area in the front of the complex that consists of beautiful stone paths amongst large palm trees right up to the waters edge! There are more reclining lounges to hear the sound of the ocean as you read your latest book or have a sneaky afternoon nap. Also located in this area is the superb restaurant Warung Kelapa. You will have complimentary breakfast here each morning. This breakfast doesn't disappoint and will often fill you up so much you won't want lunch - delicious fresh fruit, smoothies, eggs, bacon, mushrooms, tomatoes, baked beans, toast and homemade banana pancake! However make sure you also have lunch and dinner - the menu changes daily depending on the freshness of the local ingredients. We developed a large appetite for the most, flavoursome crossiants filled with tomato, bacon and cheese for lunch. The owners, Robyn and Dean (of which nothing is too difficult or troublesome) even put on a daily special on constant rotation for us because we absolutely adored the homemade coconut pancake. \n\nThe staff are attentive, friendly, astute and impossible to fault. They clean your rooms daily to perfection and cook and prepare the food all in-house. \n\nMake sure you hire a scooter to take advantage of the local waterfalls and scenic locations - the roads are very good and easy to drive. \n\nWe also went over New Years where a special dinner was put on and we had an amazing time with the other guests all around a large communal table. It was the highlight of the trip and we took time out to light our own fireworks off the edge of the water!!\n\nOne tip is to potentially stock up on food/drink you want to keep in your Villa at a supermarket in a larger town - Tejakula is very secluded, the cost of say soft drink for example is a little higher and make be harder to obtain (although any troubles - ask the superb managers Budi and Wayan and they will be able to assist).\n\nThank you Weta, Gede, Made, Ketut, Wayan, Budi, Robyn, Dean and all the staff for creating the most tranquil location I could have imagined.",

              "text": "Having just made a booking to return to this wonderful part of Bali again over Christmas and New Year it reminded me to do a Review, though I would prefer to keep this new Resort a secret. The location is on the north coast and the Villas are luxurious and accommodating. I stayed in a Deluxe King Room and am booking a complete Villa with friends when I return. The staff are amazing and nothing is too much trouble. The breakfast is wonderful, freshly prepared each day and any other meals are equally as good. You must try the Tuna wrapped in Banana Leaves as well as the Mahi Mahi. This is freshly caught each day and delivered to The Villas - all of the dishes prepared by Made and Iluh were fantastic and all so fresh.\n \nThe swimming pool was great for swimming and the snorkelling just off the shore directly in front was amazing. I am not a diver but it certainly made me think about giving it a try. Another must do is to go out fishing or just for a cruise in an authentic Balinese fishing boat, you get the most amazing views looking back at the island. Just exploring the area on a motor scooter is a great way to check things out as well and Budi and Wayan have a number of great tours that they can arrange for you. If you want to have a relaxing holiday and an escape from the normal busy tourist areas then this place is a dream and I cannot wait to return.",

It was also lovely meeting the owner. We were given a local mobile so we could contact the staff. \nThe location was near a temple so we sometimes heard live gamelan music which was delightful. It is approx 7km from the Tejakula town centre so it is useful to have your own transport, however the staff can arrange everything even if you don't.\nThanks to you all for making our stay so enjoyable.",

              "text": "This place was our highlight on our 11 day Bali round trip. We stayed 3 nights after hearing about this brand new place at Villa Saraswati in Ubud (same owner). Two things made the stay so memorable:\n\nThe absolutely luxurious villas, where everything is perfect:private pool, ocean view, fabulous bathroom, very comfortable bed, fully equipped kitchen, there were even playing cards (which we forgot to bring); everything is spotless and designed and built with great passion; \n\nThe great team performing an outstanding discreet but hearty service: the managing couple Wayan and Budi lead this the team with great dedication so that they anticipate your every wish. Each single staff member was so kind and great in his job. The food, which was freshly prepared in our open-air kitchen, was very delicious. Try the fresh whole Tuna and the Chicken Sate! Excursions with Budi and Wayan were also great fun. They took us sarong shopping, climbing Mt. Batur and see the close Les Waterfalls and were always there for us. They really do care a lot about there guests and even gave us a mobile phone so we can call them if needed. \nOutstanding service and wonderful people!\n\nWe love to come back to this place which will even be getting better soon as its waterfront Warung and tropical garden will be finished in some weeks. Don't miss this place! Absolutely perfect for relaxing holiday!",

The villas are private with your own pool, and are spotlessly clean. The rooms are beautifully decorated with local artisan furniture and art. Wayan the owner was a spectacular hostess. We absolutely loved her and will be coming back! She spoke good English and was so helpful and welcoming. Wayan is everything that embodies Balinese style hospitality. You haven\u2019t completely experienced the feel of Bali until you come here!  \n\nThe villas are located on the East coast of Bali, which has a lot of snorkeling and diving in that area. We loved being able to see the ocean and hear the waves from our villa! It was a wonderful and memorable New Year\u2019s for us! \n\nWe\u2019ll definitely be back! ",

They organised everything from sunrise fishing, a mount Batur sunrise climb, Waterfalls, spa treatments and onward travel. The villa was clean and spacious with a lovely outdoor kitchen and lounge area. The overall space was huge.\nThe food, the setting, the immaculate gardens, the fabulous massages but most of all the genuine and kind staff, makes this hotel a perfect place to stay and unwind.\nThanks Wayan and Budi for a wonderful stay.",

Each Villa has its own sparklingly clear pool set in tropical gardens, perfect for swimming and reading by. We really appreciated the friendly helpful assistance in organising a very successful fishing trip, motorbike hire and visit to the local traditional morning market. Even better we were able to enjoy the morning\u2019s catch of  Mahi Mahi for dinner in the Warung Kelapa expertly prepared by Made. We also recommend taking advantage of the Spa Menu for Balinese Massage from Iluh. There are four two bedroom Villas here catering for sixteen guests in total and it would be the perfect venue for a small wedding, retreat, workshop or family celebration. In all a wonderful break for rest and relaxation.",

And while you were so occupied, the cleaning 'fairies' would come and  you would return to a spotless room.\nThe villas are large and beautifully appointed and the adjoining lounge is equipped with a stocked fridge and freezer, and even chilled glasses provided\nThe managers Budi and Wayan, and their wonderful staff are all friendly and helpful. \nMassages provided by Ilu were of a high standard; background music provided by the sea or the local roosters!\nWe felt like part of the family by the time we left, and we hope to return",

Budi and Wayan and their staff were very generous and helpful, providing us with traditional dress for a special visit to the temple. They also arranged transport for a wonderful trip to nearby waterfalls and a morning of snorkelling. A massage, with the sound of the sea in the background, was the perfect way to relax before we sadly had to leave.",

From the room to the food to the atmosphere, it was great! Budi and Wayan were awesome! The staff is so friendly and helpful! We will be back! The rooms were comfortable, clean and spacious! Snorkeling right from the resort was a plus! The site describes a common living space but it is really a lounge area shared between 2 private villas and is so spacious and accommodating you hardly notice anything else! Great place, beautiful views and clean comfortable rooms!",

There\u2019s none of the nightlife and hassle of the more popular tourist areas, which suited myself and my wife just fine. The daytime activities consist mainly of snorkelling, diving and fishing, none of which we did because the ocean was pretty rough while we were there. Apart from an early morning trip to Mt Batur we did pretty much nothing but laze by the pool and read books. Budi and Wayan are terrific hosts and all the staff are so friendly. The food at the Kepala Restaurant is excellent. Try the pork ribs, they are sensational but don\u2019t forget to order in advance\n",

There are 3 villas,each with 2 huge en-suite rooms located either side of a big shared living space open to the courtyard. The courtyard has a private pool of s good size. Each room has a separate entry from the courtyard and they are across a narrow lane (only used for access to a temple) from the immaculate garden and restaurant/bar that is right on the ocean frontage. \nThe food and service is excellent, and being small, you get to meet other people and get to know Wayan Budhi and their wonderful staff. \nPlus there is a spa on site.\nIt is about 3hrs from Denpasar Airport but worth the trip and they will arrange transfers by small air conditioned van.  \nAnd they can arrange day trips plus there is a dive Centre next door.

We ate at the restaurant each night and truly enjoyed it each time. The setting is fabulous, right at the beach (black sand and pebbles), with a beautiful reef to snorkel in front of the Villas, and a tranquil setting. The staff and owners were extremely helpful and accommodating and did a great job in organizing transfers and activities.",

When we arrived at the Villas we were greeted by name by our Host Bodi and Staff member Mane given a smiling welcome, chilled flannels and a choice of freshly squeezed fruit juice. So started our lovely 6 nights in Tejakula. Each Villa complex has 2 seperate large bedrooms and spacious bathroom a shared common room with gas top and fridge. An outdoor courtyard with pool and lounges and all air conditioned. There are 4 identical complexes in total and all separated to allow privacy. The grounds of the recreation area leading to the waters edge are beautifully maintained, the restaurant under the the Bali thatched roof was our Breakfast location but the terrace was where we enjoyed our optional lunch and evening meals, gazing out onto the water and in the evening watching superb sunsets. What a great fined this was. Our Hosts Bodi and Wayan ensured we were looked after and the villa staff were fantastic and always happy to please us. The Villas provided an additional massage room, and the massages were great. Bodi also organised additional side trips to the Waterfalls and cruising on the water looking for Dolphins, snorkeling and fishing. Would absolutely recommend the Villas Tejakula, it was relaxing, warm, peaceful and was Balinese owned and run.",

Each villa has a private pool and an undercover outdoor lounge area as well.\n\nEvery meal I had was lovely and the dining area overlooks the water.  There is a reef only 20m off the shore so swimming or snorkelling is an amazing experience. \n\nWayan and Budi and their lovely staff are all very friendly and helpful, it is a small resort so they know each guest by name.  I felt like a princess the whole time I was there -  I didn't want to come home!  I will definitely be back.",

This simply wasn\u2019t enough time to fully enjoy this tranquil paradise! \n\nThe Villa was beautifully designed and sparkling clean! The property looks onto the beautiful Bali sea, which is great for snorkelling and diving. The property restaurant is very good and has ocean side tables. The staff are lovely people, so kind and accommodating. The manager recommended a guided hike to Les Waterfall, which totally exceeded our expectations (stunning waterfalls with essentially no other tourists).\n\nThis spot is a hidden gem and is perfect for couples or families trying to find peace, relaxation and a more true Balinese experience. \n\n",

It was approximately a three hour drive from the airport with windy hilly roads.  Ms. Wayan arranged for a driver, Gooday, who taught us about Bali on our long road trip.  Our flight was delayed and brought us into Tejakula around 10pm.  Ms. Wayan called Gooday to ask if we would like food prepared upon our arrival.  This wasn't just a sandwich in our room when we arrived....it was dinner by the ocean, full course, including all types of seafood....absolutely delicious and very special.  We went right to sleep so we could be up at 2am to start our Mt. Batur sunrise adventure.  Ms. Wayan also set up our ride and guide which made our lives much easier.  Don't miss Mt. Batur!!!  We came back and received massages, which were glorious.  Then the preparation for our wedding ceremony began.  They really went out of their way to make our day completely special!!!  Our villas was beyond amazing with a private pool, large kitchen, gazebo and small touches like books and cards to play.  The whole property is boasting beautifully maintained plant life and tropical decor and all of the staff and management are kind, beautiful people.  If you are looking for a less traveled location with high end service, this is the place!",

Budi, Wayan, and the staff family are superb hosts, who made us feel welcome from the start, and throughout our week long stay. The villa and surrounding gardens are artfully arranged, and we enjoyed the privacy and quiet of our large two-bedroom villa and private pool to relax in, and also the lovely ocean front deck to enjoy our meals in the common space. The menu had an impressive variety of choices--including a nice variety of vegetarian options. It is rare for our family to agree on a restaurant because of our wildly different food preferences, so we were delighted to find such a diverse menu, and enjoyed every meal on site.  Everything was fresh, hand prepared, and beautifully presented.  There is not a beach on site, but we snorkled along the reef just off shore. The water was warm, and stairs from the deck make it a pleasant and easily accessible swim in the calm waters, and light current. Gear was available, as was just about everything else that we could have wanted.  Wayan arranged a trip for us, as I had mentioned wanting to spend a day at the beach.  While I enjoyed the water and waves, I was happy to go back to Tejakula, where there were no hawkers, and lots of peace and quiet.  It is a long way from the tourist areas and shops, and this is something to be mindful of when packing, though when I ran out of contact lens solution, I soon discovered that Wayan is the person who knows how to get anything, and I was soon presented with a little shopping bag and a bottle of solution.  Villas Tejakula is a paradise on Earth!",

Our hosts Wayan and Bhudi were exceptional and arranged for tours and looked after us like family - my daughter's nut allergy was no problem\n\nPros: our 2 king sized bedrooms with our own pool was luxurious, air conditioning was great, the villa is protected from the wind, the food plentiful and delicious\n\nThere is no cons - but of course this is Bali so wifi connection was sometimes weak but that only lasted for 20 mins or so ( I\u2019m stretching here to find something con)\n\nThe villas is a 4 star that is better then most 5 stars and the price is ideal- highly recommend and cannot say enough of how great it was!\n\nthank you Wayan and Bhudi!",

The staff are extremely accommodating, the villas are very large with indoor and outdoor space and a very large private pool. Snorkelling is possible only 20 meters from the beach and we particularly enjoyed going out with a local fisherman. Very relaxing and we highly recommend the Villas at Tejakula.",

The rooms are amazing: beautifully decorated with such eye for detail.\nThey have thought about everything! We wanted for nothing. Big luxurious bathrooms, large living area with fridge filled with cold drinks. The pool was wonderful just the right size for swimming lapses.\nThe gardens were so well maintained and beautiful.\nThe restaurant is situated right on the ocean front and the service is impeccable and friendly. Food very tasty and well presented. On the last evening we ordered \u201cnasi campur\u201d a collection of Indonesian specialities.\nPleasant spa where you can enjoy a massage while listening to the waves.\nThanks to Wayan, Budi, Wede, Ketut, Ulih and all the other staff for making our stay so enjoyable!",

From quick replies when booking, the gorgeous villas, the stunning grounds and ocean views, the excellent food and especially all the lovely staff who totally spoilt us.\n\nThe drive from Sanur was a few hours but so picturesque the time passed quickly. Budi picked us up, he is an excellent driver and pointed out many interesting things as we drove...or we just laughed as he has a great sense of humour.\n\nDespite a bit of rain ( it was rainy season so we were expecting it) and an injured foot preventing me doing all I had planned, such as the waterfall walk, we could not have had a better 6 night stay. My partner enjoyed daily massages while I swam in the divine pool. We tried many of the dishes on  the menu...loved them all. The ribs, fish and the Balinese breakfasts were stand outs.\n\nThanks to Wayan, Budi and all the wonderful staff for our perfect stay....we will definitely return!",

              "text": "I agree with the praise given in previous reviews. This is a place to relax, calm yourself, reconnect and enjoy the Balinese culture and hospitality. The gardens are serene. The snorkeling, just 20m off the front provides a diversity of coral in a huge reef area. The drop off zone would be a great area for first time divers. The sun lounges and day beds in the villa are perfect for lazing and listening to the playlist of tunes provided. The pool is magical for night swims, all lit up within the tropical garden. This would be a wonderful place for groups of friends or family, a romantic stay for couples, or even an ideal spot for a wedding. The villa is all quality, including fittings and although you may not initially notice the small touches, like sarongs or the large water cooler to minimise plastic, the daily flowers and offerings reflect the genuine Balinese nature and generosity of the host. We were fortunate to stay during the spectacular Gulagem festival and we were welcomed to the beautiful temple at the end of the street by the locals. Finally, do yourself a favour, book a fishing trip with the local fisherman for a memorable and fun afternoon out, and enjoy the delicious cocktails when you return. The food, and service is akin to luxury anywhere in the world... but once you come here, you wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere else.",

The staff were friendly, polite,prompt and well informed.\nThe rooms are large, well airconditioned, very quiet and spotless. We were welcomed with a snmile and cold towels to freshen up. Given a comprehensive tour of the property, so we were never wandering around trying to find things. I loved that my husband and I were given our own sarongs to use while we stayed there, nice touch! \nThis property is very well maintained, and very private.\nThe food was amazing. We would watch the fishermen bring the fresh fish in daily, and of course order it for lunch/dinner. I am not usually a fan of spring rolls, but do yourself a favour..they are delish!\nBreakfast every morning was HUGE!\nPerfect boiled eggs with a rye bread.\nAnd I could go on for days about the fruit...\nOk, I'll stop now. \nWe loved every second of our stay, we cannot fault one thing.\nSee you next year Wayan :)",

Wayan and her family looked after us in their beautiful villas and although we could only stay for three nights we we\u2019re privileged to witness their temple\u2019s birthday just next door. Thanks to Gede for taking Don fishing in the deep water and the restaurant\u2019s chef for making a couple of meals with the delicious Mahi-mahi. We\u2019ll definitely be back for a longer stay next time",

The villa Tejakula was amazing...everything was so beautiful, the villa was amazing.. we were lucky to have the villa to ourselves for a couple of days...we loved the outside living area and the honesty bar!!.. if you took anything out of fridge you just wrote down what you\u2019d taken...we spent our days around the beautiful pool and relaxing in the afternoon having a massage at the spa...it was so beautiful having a massage and just listening to the waves.. ( thank you Iluh) what really made our stay so amazing was the staff...Wayan and Budi are the most amazing hosts... Budi chatted with us every day at breakfast...he told of his childhood and of his life in Bali ( We left feeling part of his family) but also not forgetting the other staff ..many thanks to Darma who was the mist amazing and attentive waiter... also the lovely young lady who also served us,\nand also to ketut and Made  for looking after our Villa .... and to the chefs and also to the staff who\nLooked after all the gardens. We truly had an amazing time here... and I really wanted to write this review... but in my heart \u2763 I wanted really to keep the place a secret... as I want to return in the future... and hope it\u2019s not fully booked!! But also want to share with everyone what a wonderful time we had staying at this property with the most beautiful people... until the next time \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95",

Spectacular view onto the ocean, lovely designed villas with own pool, great restaurant with amazing food. The highlight was to get a Mahi Mahi fish prepared which we caught by ourselves during a boat trip just a few hours before. Do strongly recommend the boat trip including swimming, snorkeling and fishing. Great experience! Very close to paradise \ud83d\ude04",

The food was very nice, I\u2018d say you served me the best chicken curry I had on the island! \nThe Villa was just stunning and there is really nothing to add about your service, it was just perfect! Ketut and his companions even climbed to the ceiling in my room to find a mysterious animal that kept me awake the first night, which, when we detected it, turned out to be a pair of socks :D We all had a very good laugh about that! We will surely recommend you and hopefully come back one day to meet you again.\nKind regards \nJenni & Nadja",

Everything you need - even great music - is provided, spacious and tastefully decorated villas and bathrooms; wonderful food in the restaurant, we tried almost everything on the menue! The restaurant is set overlooking the ocean. Very helpful and friendly staff! Also the massage parlour is very nice. All in all a wonderful facility, we would travel to Bali again just to be able to stay at the villas again!",

Situated in a quiet corner of NE Bali, far removed from the chaos and overcrowding of the South, this beautiful complex of private villas with gorgeous 10m lap pools is just the place to unwind. Rooms are beautiful, gardens immaculate and the setting on a small volcanic sand beach with lively snorkelling out front is serene. The food, especially the breakfast, is great and the staff friendly, kind and attentive. The place is clearly a labour of love for the owners. Dont come here if you want evening entertainment, late nights at the bar, TV and lightening fast internet. Do come here if you just want to switch off for a while. Just lovely.",

When we arrived late I did notice that there was someone in the villa next to us. The next morning after breakfast when we came back they were gone.\nWe had the place to ourselves for.our entire stay.\nBed & bathroom were great. Bed big & comfy. Bathroom beautiful & functional with two sinks.\nWifi worked & was good.\nLocation was right on the water so the views were just magic.\nBreakfast was included & delicious.\nStaff were sweet & friendly without being in your business too much.\nGot 3 massages each while we were there. \nVery reasonably priced for a hotel spa.\n\nCons\nEverybody else is going to know about it now & we may never get the place to ourselves again.",

We spent a week relaxing in clean comfortable quiet surroundings.  We have stayed in many four and five star hotels and I can honestly say that this was my favourite place so far.  We had our own pool too and the privacy of the Villa was perfect.  Wayan and Budi were great and helped with any requests we had.  We moved south after our stay to a very fancy 5 star hotel and just wanted to go back to the Villas Tejakula.  We choose this place specifically as they dont allow small children and we were so happy with our choice.  I cant rate this place highly enough and we will definitely go back if we are in Bali again.",

Location is very secluded and quiet but there is still access to many activities. There is a beautiful coral reef just a few meters from the black sand beach, and not many places can you sit on the beach and see the sunrise and sunset over the ocean.\nThe staff was amazing and made us feel like family, the food was excellent, and we got massages everyday, some of the best massages we\u2019ve ever had. \nWe ran every morning through the village and saw the local market as well as ran to the Les Waterfall.",

Each villa has a private room and bathroom and a shared pool and outdoor/indoor lounge area. The pools are shared between 2 to 3 rooms so it is very private. We had professional massages everyday we stayed here. We loved the city because it is not packed like many other tourist towns in Bali. We went fishing on a Bali boat. Snorkeled around the coral reefs and hiked to a spiritual waterfall. The town is only 1 hour from Mt. Batur and there are many things to do in the area. I recommend adding this hotel to your travel itinerary on your next trip to Bali. The volcano has been erupting but Tejakula is 40 km away so it should be far enough away to stay safe. The erupting volcano did not disrupt our trip at all but we got to see smoke coming out which is pretty. ",

A complete contrast to the bustle of Ubud, you'll relax instantly and be wowed by the stunning villas, with their private pools in beautifully landscaped courtyards, with a large comfortable bed, semi-outdoor showers, and attention to detail everywhere you look. Choose from the menu of massages from the in-house spa (hot stones, traditional Balinese and more) and enjoy your massage with the ocean waves in your ear, or dine overlooking the ocean and enjoy the very reasonably priced and delicious food at Warung Kelapa A La Carte Restaurant and Bar. We highly recommend the Romantic Dinner for Two which you can book in advance (we enjoyed the local seafood and the ribs...and the chefs special pizza). We will be back and recommend to anyone.",

The Villas were perfect for a relaxing stay in a different part of Bali. We drove around the area and were reassured that The Villas were clearly the best location to stay in that region. The ocean and garden setting is beautiful; the villa was modern, stylish and pleasing (we didn't even notice the absence of TV!); there were interesting things to do (eg, snorkelling); the food was wonderfully prepared and was moderately and reasonably priced; and the management and staff were just a delight. Every one of them took time to chat to us and become friends and make suggestions on things we could do. We highly recommend a stay at The Villas.",

When we weren\u2019t resting by the sea we were snorkeling or the ladies were having a massage. Our hosts, Budi and Wayan made us feel very welcome.

              "text": "WOW!!! Such a stunning hideaway of 4 private villas, directly on the north shore of Bali. So peaceful, tranquil and the perfect place to experience the luxury hosted by the friendly and hospitable Balinese locals. Wayan, Budi and the entire team are incredibly detail-oriented.\n\nWe were lucky and had the entire 2-room villa to ourselves. Total privacy in our own exclusive villa with luxurious pool!! Heaven on Earth!\n\nThe food at their restaurant... absolutely delicious - every single meal. The Balinese breakfast was gorgeous! All fresh produce, carefully prepared. We did not ever feel ill (NO \u201cBali Belly\u201d). And the bar... generous drinks with NO substituted spirits!!\n\nThe massages at their very own day spa are to die for!! And so affordable to have one every day :)\n\nDo yourself a favour and book here!! Even if for a few nights - you will be totally amazed and wonder why you didn\u2019t book more nights.\n\nIf staying locally, come and enjoy a massage or facial, breakfast, lunch, dinner or just cocktails while sitting by the lapping ocean-front. All food, spirits & service are TOP quality.\n\nTravellers tip: Please don\u2019t let Mt Agung scare you away. It is far away and enough to be very safe. Besides, on the very rare occasion.... there\u2019s no better place to be \u201cstuck\u201d for a few extra days - haha!!",

So good to be away from the busyness of tourists and meet again the true Balinese spirit. Really great to have a villa for our child and a villa for the adults in a safe secure shared walled-garden compound and large clean private pool with the addition of our own bathrooms and a shared open walled lounge, dining kitchen. Fresh water daily and room serviced each day, fresh food deliciously prepared and no illnesses. Can run/walk a nearby 5km hill loop with sea views, Great doing Yoga with Geda by the beach every morning. Iluh gave the best massages and spa care.",

Greeted by Budi and Wayan, shown to a spacious room, with a shared pool and lounge area, it was clear that everything was well maintained, chicly appointed, and that the entire Tejakula team was in sync to have you enjoy your time there. Great snorkeling off the house reef, incredibly delicious food served by Darma (who also mixes a tasty cocktail!), and cooked by Made- everything was local, fresh, delicious and beautifully presented. It was such a great respite from the hustle of South Bali- I hope I get the chance to return!",

The rooms are large, well appointed and beautifully decorated in the Balinese style. The bathrooms are beautiful and very big and the in-house restaurant Warung Kelapa, is excellent. The managers, Budi and Wayan and their staff are wonderful, ready to attend to the guests\u2019 every need. I would highly recommend this place for a quiet holiday reading, relaxing, swimming, doing some snorkelling and perhaps hiring a car with a driver and going a little further afield to explore the real Bali.

It is an area of Bali that seems to be less visited by tourists which is part of its charm.\nThe Villas are located right on the waterfront with access for swimming and snorkeling and are surrounded by tropical gardens.\nThe accommodation is first class with large rooms and a pool to each of the 5 villas.\nBudi and Wayan manage a first class operation together with attentive and caring staff who look after your every need.\nThe meals at the resort restaurant, Warung Kelapa, are excellent and cover a good range of traditional Balinese,Javanese and European food.\nThis is a place to sit and relax and take a day trip out two, snorkel, have a lazy swim in the sea or your pool, but not a place for partying. You will need to go elsewhere in Bali for that.",

Beautiful rooms with access to fridge and pool.  The fridge was always stocked with beer and wine to buy. The setting right on the water was so serene.  The snorkeling in front of The Villa's was absolutely great.  There is a dive shop next door for those into scuba.  We mainly stayed at the property for meals and rest. The food is wonderful at the restaurant which also has a bar.  Prices were very reasonable.  Close by are excursions to waterfalls, snorkeling and local crafts. Do your shopping in Ubud.  The staff was always there to take care of any needs that might arise.   If you should need help with transportation or excursions, the owners will take care of everything.  I will return to the Villa's in Tejakula.  I highly recommend this property for rest and relaxation.",

The food is very reasonably priced and delicious. Breakfast was included each day. We enjoyed the traditional Balinese breakfast twice because it was so good. There's a diving center next door that we used twice. We would love to come back. This would be a wonderful place to come with our family (children and grandchild)",

              "text": "The Villas Tejakula is a hidden oasis in Bali's north, offering a stunning outlook to the ocean and beautiful tropical gardens. I stayed in a two bedroom villa with my husband, which offered us a private pool and ample space for two people. Each villa is beautifully constructed with high ceilings and lovely craftsmanship. The staff and owners are friendly and accommodating, making your stay carefree.  The thoughtful additions of an outdoor shower, a fridge and a private supply of drinking water make The Villas Tejakula stand out. The drive to The Villa Tejakula from Ubud offered us the opportunity to see Kintamani and incredible views of Mount Batur and Mount Agung.  Definitely recommend The Villas Tejakula as as base for exploring northern Bali.",

              "text": "Where to begin? We had very high expectations of The Villas Tejakula after reading all the wonderful reviews here. Our expectations were exceeded ten-fold. Our stay at Villas Tejakula was better than we could have imagined. From the staff, to the food, to the villas themselves - everything was impeccable. \n\nThe staff were extremely friendly, went out of their way to be helpful, and we were struck not only by their professionalism but also their dedication and pride in their work. The Villas Tejakula should be commended for bringing together such a fine group of people. \n\nThe food was fantastic! The menu was varied, well-priced and, most importantly, absolutely delicious. We never tempted to go anywhere else. The staff, again, were wonderful. We loved seeing Weda, Darma (his cocktails are fabulous!) and Gede each day. \n\nThe villas are gorgeous. Each bedroom is beautifully appointed, the bathroom is exquisite, and the outdoor seating area was a lovely place to relax. Having a pool to share between two villas is a great touch. \n\nFinally, as many of the previous reviewers have noted, Budi and Wayan are fantastic. They are consummate hosts. They take care of their guests as if their guests are being welcomed into their own home. We were so grateful for their warmth, their suggestions on what we could do each day - and finally, on our last day, being sent off with a hearty breakfast despite our early start. \n\nTwo more quick points: firstly, the Spa is well worth a visit - Iluh\u2019s facials in particular are sublime - and secondly, it is worth noting that Mt Agung is approximately 50 km away from Tejakula. It is therefore well out of range of danger in the event of an eruption!",

              "text": "We were so happy that we made a wise choice to stay in this lovely villa for a short four-day trip to Bali to de-stress ourselves. It is located in Tedjakula, the north part of Bali island, suitable for people who seek experiences different from the touristy part of Bali. \n\n       Each villa has two beautiful, spotless, spacious rooms, with a shared living room/kitchen area and a nice little private pool. We had the luxury to have the whole villa to ourselves as managers Wayan and Budi purposefully give every guest as much privacy as possible during the time the villas are not fully occupied. There is a gorgeous garden outside the villas, facing the sea and black rocky beach, peaceful and idyllic. \n\n        The food and drinks are fresh and nice with reasonable prices. We liked best was the freshly grilled tuna wrapped in a banana leaf. And we enjoyed the massage, too, which helped relieve my back pain. \n\n      All the staff are so nice to us the whole time. They do their best to meet our every request and we enjoyed chatting with each of them. We were so impressed by their spontaneous, hearty smiles, which open a window for us to explore more about the local cultures and the religious faith. \n\n       Budi helped us arrange a couple of tours to a few places of interest in the north, and what we like most is the Water Palace and the Buddhist Monastery. Staying in Tedjekula, though 3-4 hours drive from airport, allowed us to have a glimpse of the fascinating, authentic Balinese cultures and local life, so it is totally worth for us. \n\n        All the best Villas Tedjakula! Hope that one day we will go back.",

The beach is very small and made of black volcanic rocks, but the reef is very nice and full of fishes (perfect for snorkling or diving from the nearby center). The hotel is located in a non touristic are of Bali, so it's far from caos, while it's easy to organise in the surroundings great walks in the forest/waterfalls, bike tours and visit to unspoiled - though with volcanic black send - beaches.",

PICTURES DO  NOT DO JUSTICE.\n\nEach villa (there are 4 separate), has 2 bedrooms and each a private pool. The grounds are lush, the restaurant has such a great variety too choose from and the cocktails are a must.\n\nLocated on the grounds is its own private day spa, during my stay I had to try a different massage each day. \n\nThe staff will go above and beyond too make you feel at home and nothing is to hard food them. \n\nThis is a stunning night g tranquil oasis on the sea, I'm so glad I didn't let Mt Agung keep me away, we were not affected at all. \n\nI will be back here to stay without a doubt.",

Without a doubt, the Villas Tejakula was my favorite location and I look forward to going back.  It was a combination of stunning accommodations, attentive and professional staff, as well as a breathtaking location that made for the perfect stay.  On my travels I stayed at a number of places throughout the island, including the forests above Ubud to the sun drenched beaches of the southern part of Bali.  The north part of the island really has it all.  The calm ocean waters, good snorkeing, a slower pace of life and much fewer tourists make this an ideal landing spot for couples and families alike.  The service, staff, accommodations and location for the villas is ideal. I look forward to my return,",

You shouldn't be at all worried about visiting while the volcano it rumbling (it's about as far from Agung as Ubud is). The staff are wonderful and the villas are very private with their own pool. When I'm along the north coast next, I'll definitely be staying for more than one night (and I'll bring friends).",

Banana pancakes are soooo good!!\nFood in the restaurant was of a very high standard and excellent value.\nWe ordered a whole tuna ..... cooked in banana leaves on the BBQ and the rest served as sashimi. Unbelievably good! \n\nIt is a three hour drive from the airport but dfinitely worth the trip!\nCocktails and beautiful sunsets! \nExcellent massage listening to the roar of the ocean!\nHighly recommended!!!",

The outdoor living area was great for chilling after a day at the pool and snorkeling in the sea.\n\nThere is a beautiful coral reef just 20 meters away from the resort's shore. We went snorkeling everyday and saw lots of different kind of colourful fish. We also did a boat trip to have a look at the coastline and saw lots of dolphins. We went swimming and it was amazing to see and hear the dolphins around you.\n\nAll the staff at the Villas Tejakula are extremely nice and friendly! A big thank you to all! The service at the restaurant was great and we had very relaxing massages at the spa. The managers are friendly and will help you in organizing all the activities you want. \n\nThis is a peaceful and beautiful small resort, which we definitely wish to return to one day! I have to say, this is one of best places we have ever stayed at! We were so happy to spend our holiday here. Thank you once again for an amazing stay! ",

Comfortable rooms, great private pool,  and helpful and friendly staff make this a place to relax and get away from the crowds in the south or anywhere else for that matter. \n Budi and Wayan visited with us multiple times each day to make sure all was well. All the staff were eager to please us. We were treated like family. \nThere is a large breakfast and the menu for lunch and dinner is extensive with reasonable prices. Drinks too are reasonably priced. My wife had great massages each day. \nOne thing that stands out to me is the communication. We had booked many months prior to our November stay. I sent a few queries that were all answered immediately. The hotel also made an effort to send regular updates on the Mt. Agung situation. \nWe hope the volcano gets done with its latest fit of anger to allow tourism to get back to normal and for this gem of a place to flourish.\nThe six days there were great and I could easily relax there for weeks. \n\n",

As you are aware we are still waiting to see if our Volcano has finished with its \"anger\" or not, but we do hope so.  \nMeanwhile we are blessed with wonderful weather and all of our guests are enjoying their experience with us as you obviously did taking the opportunity to enjoy our wonderful massages with Iluh, the ocean has been calm with great snorkeling and diving opportunities and as usual Made, Gede and Kadek are tantalising everyone's tastebuds with their beautifully fresh dishes.   Dharma or course, is famous for his smile and his great Cocktails.    All this making you wish you were back ? - well we hope it will be soon as you are missed by your new Bali family.\nThank you for taking the time to share your experience with other travellers and we look forward to welcoming you back again soon when I can assure you we will do our utmost to make your stay even better !\nBest wishes for 2018\nWayan, Budi and the Staff at The Villas Tejakula",

This is of course largely down to the staff, who are so relaxed and friendly that you cannot help but relax as well.\nThe breakfasts are massive (same menu as Villa Saraswati in Ubud) --- we just love the banana pancakes with honey. One day we all had the Balinese breakfast --- I didn't think I could eat that much that early in the day.....\nSpecial thanks to all the staff for making it such an enjoyable stay --- to Wayan and Budy, and especially to the ever-cheerful Darma.\nHope to see you all again sometime.",

Eat by the water and go back in your villa for a private pool dive after. \n\nThe staff there are the sweetest! Wayan and Budy the owners, but also all the rest. One of the girls from the kitchen insisted that i borrowed her scooter, because i wanted some late night chocolate from the city.\n\nThe food is great! I havent got a dish there i didnt like, and everything is very tasty. Try the balineese beeakfast (order the day before)\n\nJust outside you can snorkle, borrow the gear from the villas and dive in. We saw multiple collored fish, a porcupine fish and even a sea turtle. Watch out for the current though.\n\nGood to know:\n\nThis is not a tourist area, so people dont want to rip you off, they are actually just helpfull when they ask if you need any help.\n\nWalk a bit down by the water and you will find local fishermen, happy to tell their story.\n\nGo to Les Waterfall before lunch and have the chocolate smoothie at Gedes on the way down.",

The Les Waterfall that is nearby is also another popular short excursion as is the early morning walk to the local market just 15 minutes away.   There are also the wonderful Spa treatments and the opportunity to just relax and let your cares drift away.\nThank you for sharing your experience and we hope to welcome you back again soon.\nBest wishes,\nWayan, Budi & All the Staff at\nThe Villas Tejakula",

We were not disappointed having selected The Villa\u2019s for its tranquil location away from the bustle of the south. \n\nWe spent three days and wished we had longer, we enjoyed the local market, the old capital, and a local Dive site.   \n\nThe accommodation is well presented and private.  The food, service and hospitality were amazing.  We look forward to returning in the future. \n\nThe staff were very sociable and attentive.   Gardens very well presented and maintained.   The private pool was amazing with cool breeze from the sea. \n\nThe drive from the airport was great as you get to take in Bali and head over the Mountain range down into Tejakula.  \n\nWould highly recommend, five stars.",

Darma your 'Hello' brought a smile on my face every time! \n\nMade, Kadek and Gede thank you so much for preparing me those wonderful dishes three times a day. I won't forget my spicy Nasi Goreng for breakfast. One of my favourites! Oh, and of course the spring rolls! Those were the best I have ever had! \n\nKetut and Made, thank you for always being there whenever I needed something. SUSKSMA!!\n\nIluh, your massages are a true gift. I have never felt better after after being treated by your magic hands! \n\nSri, you even made my laundry smell like heaven. \n\nDana, all the gardens look absolutely perfect, fresh and colorful. Made me feel so happy! Thank you! \n\nGede, I have never had the pleasure meeting you, but it felt great to know that you were my guardian angel at night! \n\nAnd of course Wayan and Budi for creating this little piece of heaven on this gorgeous island and for creating such a wonderful, loving and caring team! \n\nLots of love for all of you and I hope to see you all again in the very near future!\n\nErwin",

We didn't feel the need to venture far as the service and food was not only delicious but also had such good variety that we felt really spoilt. We in particular enjoyed the cocktails - best in Bali I reckon! I highly recommend venturing over the north of Bali and stay at The Villas Tejakula - Bali at its best!!!!",

The place is very secluded n there is no TV but have wifi for ur contact to the outside world \ud83d\ude05 but i really found peacefulness here. Many things we did enjoy in this villa snorkeling, drinking beer near the beach while reading on my iPad, hearing the waves crashing n at night time we can see so many stars. We stayed for 3 nights and one of those night happen to be my birthday so the staff made surprise happy birthday notes on my bed with flowers and during dinner brought me Bday cake. We enjoy this place and would recommend to anyone wants to enjoy the sound of silence at Villa Tejakula.",

Our accommodation was perfect in every way and totally spotless.  The bed was comfy and the adjoining dining/lounge room shared with another Villa was enjoyed by us and our Aussie neighbours. The pool was delightful and spent many hours in it.  The staff were very helpful and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable.  The breakfast was amazing and dinner had many options for us to choose from.  Seating for our meals had beautiful views out to the sea and the Villas well maintained grounds.  Thank you so very much for making our stay the most memorable in Bali.",

              "text": "We've spent the last couple months in Bali, including a 9 day trip around the coasts and North Bali. We've probably stayed in about 15 different hotels. This one is, by far, the most overrated one we've encountered.\n\nFirst of all, you should realize there is no beach at this beach resort. It is on the water, but the sea comes up to a bulkhead  so no sand. Also, there is no community pool, just a small one that is shared by each set of two villas.\n\nThere is no reception desk, so if you have a problem, you just have to find someone or wait; or our case, we waited for about two hours for someone to help us figure out the room safe.\n\nWe also saw a dead rat in the little road in front of the villas. To be fair, rats are a problem in Bali, and we've seen them at one other 5 star hotel. \n\nThe rooms are decent with nice bathrooms; not an amazing room by Bali standards, but nice enough. But no TV, which is kind of strange because, given no beach and really no local attractions, there is nothing to do here.\n\nThe Internet wasn't working on the morning we were there and the solution they proposed did not work either. We were told this is because of local infrastructure issues, but we didn't have similar problems at other Bali locations, even in the jungle. \n\nThey were out of the one thing I was looking forward to at dinner; the cheese plate, and they wouldn't let us breakfast in a nice seating area near the ocean just because, well, that's their policy and why trouble the staff?\n\nBut worst of all, when we finally lost our tempers, they put us on the phone with the English speaking owner, who is based, somewhere, but clearly not at the hotel. Instead of trying to fix our problems, she just wanted to argue. She seemed very surprised that anyone would complain.\n\nThe manager later offered a partial refund, which never actually came. And given the hotel, that's what I expected.",

You have proven me right and my staff are traumatised by your short visit.\nGiven your angry, abusive, foul mouthed behaviour during the 22 hours you spent at The Villas Tejakula (8 spent sleeping) and the fact that regardless of how much we did to try and satisfy you, this review with so many lies by you has come as no surprise.   \nOur Manager came in 15 minutes to open the safe, but waited for over an hour for you to finish your meal to accompany her to the room with the Master Key.  You had no difficulty in placing items therein and entering your code to lock it \u2013 the difficulty was  you did not remember your code.\nUpon arrival we explained our problems with the Internet due to the changeover to Fibre Optic and that we had purchased modems for guests to stay in touch.    You claimed it did not work with your IPhone, but they are compatible with all types of mobile devices and our other guests have appreciated that we have made every effort to overcome a problem outside of our control.\nFor those of you who are scratching their heads and saying \"What is his problem\" then we look forward to welcoming you soon and rest assured that 99% of our guests wish they had booked for longer and leave as our new friends.  \nThe Owners & Management\nThe Villas Tejakula \n\n",

              "text": "My wife and I came here on our honeymoon.  We first visited Taiwan to experience the \"city life\" that Asia had to offer and thought the relaxing atmosphere of Bali, which we have never been to, would be a good way to escape and disconnect for a few days.  \n\nIn short, the stay was amazing.  We'll sum up some of our thoughts below:\n\n- Wayan was responsive from the start, replying to emails within 24 hours and answering any major questions we had.  Definitely made a great first impression.  \n\n- If you can, rent a private villa.  There are four in total that can house four people each.  The additional privacy is worth it (you get your own pool, common lounge area with tables, sofas, and a fridge, and even a second bedroom and bathroom - not necessarily useful, but there was a childlike excitement when we could literally choose our bed each night).  You can swim and lounge around during any part of the day, and the additional freedom really helps in the honeymoon experience.\n\n- The food here is quite good.  This isn't your standard five star restaurant in a five star hotel downtown.  Nevertheless, we loved the staff's friendliness and the freshness of the ingredients and the dishes.  Definitely try the coconut pancake, spring rolls, pancake of the day during breakfast, and the balinese breakfast (needs 24 hour notice).  It's the perfect place to have a few drinks while listening to the oceans or watching the sunset.\n\n- Wifi can be spotty at times.  It's understandable given the circumstances.  Again, our goal was to escape so not having a reliable way to always check email (home or work) was a nice touch).\n\n- Definitely come in with a plan as to what you want to do.  For some, the reality that there is no structure here may be unsettling.  We caught up on books, played cards, watched movies, and got some extra sleep.  In terms of outdoor activities, we signed up for a sunrise hike (woke up at 2:30 am for a 90 min drive - understand the villa is quite far from many places, but the staff packed us sandwiches for the road!), went snorkeling right off the shore, got two massages, and were even invited to a Balinese wedding of one of the staff members.  That was a very special experience, and we very much appreciate the staff extending us an invitation to their special day.   \n\n- Staff are amazingly friendly, like family.",

              "text": "Will get the negatives out of the way upfront as they are few.    First, it takes 3 to 4 hours by car to get here from the Denpasar airport.     Second, there is no beach to lay on or common swimming pool to lay around.    Third, there are very few activities in the Villas or in the vicinity.    With the negatives out of the way, I can say with gusto that the Villas at Tejakula are a solid 5 star for those who want to go to feel old Bali, enjoy good food and service, lay around your private pool, snorkel 20 meters from the shore, or even take in some basic scuba.     Eight villa/ bedroom rooms share four pools, common living and kitchenette, in a four courtyard set up.   All high-end and lots of small details considered for your comfort.      We booked two rooms for our family so had total privacy.       The menu is both Balinese and international.     The food delivery is slow because they start from scratch, including the special order items that require 24 hour notice [Balinese breakfast, pork ribs, Balinese tuna, etc\u2026.]   A leisurely meal is fundamental to a good vacation...my view.       The advantage of not having a beach is that the sound of crashing waves constantly flow over all parts of the compact resort.    No common pool also keeps the unwanted decibels down.       The on-site massage is of good quality, requires an advance notice and must be completed by 5pm.      \n\n\u2019ve made over 15 trips to Bali in the past 25 years and can say that the Villas of Tejakula help me recall the days when you got to meet the real Balinese.    First is the village.    Tejakula has no tourist attractions.  When you wander about, the people want to engage with you because they are interested to meet you, not because they want to sell you something.    Second is the Villas staff.    They almost exclusively come from the local village.     They are genuine and open, led by Wayan and Budi, the couple who manages the business.   You can see clear evidence of good training of all staff and good management by Wayan and Budi.   \n\nWhile we spent some fulfilling days slothing between our private pool/reading books to the restaurants, and back, we did also get in some adventure.     Across the road is a scuba diving shop run by Kristina, a German.    We did shore dives in front of the Villas, which were just OK in terms of sights, but were very convenient.    We also went to the Les Waterfall, which is a moderate  walk, and has quite refreshing/cool water.    It took us 1.5 hours full turn to see Les Waterfalls, about 4km from the Villas. \n\nWe self-drove from the Densapar airport and broke up the long drives by stopping at Tirta Gangga [recommend lunch inside the park] and rice paddy views on the way out, and through Kintamani/Mt Batur on the way back.",

The villas are beautiful, large, clean, well-equipped and safe.  We treated ourselves to massages and read and swam and felt so much better on leaving.  The restaurant offered a range of freshly prepared food and we were more than happy to eat here ( the local wines and beer were pleasing too).  As this is a small establishment you get to know the staff quickly and we found them all to be pleasant and helpful.  The only issue we had was the long car drive as we aren't great overland, but forgotten it already...",

              "text": "For years we've been avoiding Bali due to its \"tourist\" reputation. And suddenly WOW we found Villas Tejakula ! having just 3 nights to spend there at the end of longer SEA holidays we've decided to take \"Bali in the pill \" and travel 4 hours one way from the airport along the fantastic scenic slopes of Mt. Batur volcano. And we loved it !\nThe place is small but great, offering all luxuries you need for few days.Gorgeous villa with private pool (not very big but it adequate ). Tranquility, remoteness, a good touch of real life north Bali village ... and sea trip at dawn in traditional boat to spot dolphins. No other boats ( except local fishermen ) within the horizon.\nGreat food in their restaurant by the seaside, maybe too much tourist focused but always tasty and prepared with a lot of expertise. \nAnd last but not least.... the people. Strangely, there were always fresh ice cubes in the fridge together with cooled glasses and bear, window blinders down at night, bed turned down twice a day..... and we never saw a men. What we saw were friendliness, smiles and competence.\nWe strongly recommend the place so much different from Nusa Dua beaches.",

It was exactly what we were looking for: a luxury stay where it was easy to jump in the water and snorkel. The nearby protected reefs are full of amazing fish and coral.

The pool is the perfect size with great shared lounge arrangements. The villas are very private while close (less than 50 metres) to the beach and bar/restaurant. \n\nSnorkelling is great, about 30 metres off the beach while the villas provide a perfect stepping off point for exploring both the north and east of Bali along with the mountainous areas of central Bali. \n\nThe absolute highlight of the Villas Tejakula, however, is the amazingly friendly service of Budi, Wayan and their team.

              "text": "...The Villas Tejakula come pretty darn close. Relatively new, the Villas have been tastefully constructed by Robyn and Dean, the owners of the equally good Villa Saraswati in Ubud. The Villas Tejakula are situated in beautiful, manicured gardens right on the shore line: shoreline is appropriate as there is no beach as such with much of this area having black lava shingle. Does it really matter that much not having a beach when your own private pool is so inviting? Not in my or my partner's eyes, no. \n\nThe bedroom and bathroom are done to the highest standard, good fittings, large comfortable bed, huge shower, double vanity basins etc. and the daily maintenance spot on. \n\nThe breakfasts were good, standard Balinese but the fruit platter included mangosteen which I love and had not been served elsewhere. Nice touch. We ate dinner twice at the resort's restaurant and enjoyed both occasions, food good, staff friendly and efficient.\n\nSo why are Villas Tejakula not quite perfect? It's a struggle to find anything to really quibble about other than its location perhaps: even though signposted it is still not the easiest place to find. This, in the overall scheme of things, is a minor quibble I do not hesitate in giving it 5 stars overall.",

              "text": "After staying in these jaw-dropping Villas just over a year ago, I knew I couldn't pass up a repeat trip when introducing Bali to my step-father. (after 1 day, he was already planning his repeat trip later this year!). Out of all the places I have ever stayed, this one is off the charts. I wish there was a higher rating than \"Excellent\" as these Villas as \"Perfection\". \n\nThe snorkelling was absolutely amazing with the suns rays shining through into the warm tropical waters providing maximum visibility to hundreds of types of fish. The snorkeling gear being provided by the Villas and the entry point to this underwater haven just metres from where you eat breakfast each morning. \n\nSince my last visit the kitchen has expanded, the seasonal fruit changed (try the mangosteen and dragonfruit- amazing!), and a spa has been built. These little additions just help reinforce why this place is so truly spectacular. The staff have remarkable attention to detail and will do their utmost to make your holiday memorable and special. From organising (and tailoring) tours (see the Dolphins at sunrise - simply wow), to adapting the complimentary breakfast to your dietary needs, to hiring a scooter, recommending local attractions and simply being attentive and always abundantly courteous, the staff are that extra something on top of an already aesthetically and practically beautiful place.\n\nThe Villas are spacious, open, private, green, absolutely clean and perfectly furnished. \n\nIf you're coming to Bali - Tejakula is a must and the Villas Tejakula is your gateway to a relatively unexplored area of Bali.",

              "text": "My boyfriend and I had originally planned to stay only 2 nights with The Villas Tejakula on our Bali round trip. We were welcomed as soon as we arrived and the friendly staff gave us a tour of our apartment, pool and the surrounding areas. Our apartment was very spacious with a large bathroom just off the bedroom. There isn't a bath but it didn't matter. Since the other apartment hadn't been booked, we had full reign of the shared pool and kitchen area. There's only 6 apartments so it's so quiet.\n\nWe hired a scooter and went to local waterfalls and morning markets of the back of staff suggestions - it was well worth it. We then hired snorkelling gear and were able to see fish straight of the water's edge. We also did a fishing tour which was very fun and had couples massages before we left. Their on site restaurant cooked such fresh and flavoursome food, we loved the breakfasts!\n\nWe actually ended up staying an extra night because we enjoyed it so much! Beautiful part of Bali with amazing staff who were very attentive. All in all, a perfect holiday, we just wish we could have stayed longer. Would recommend The Villas Tejakula to anyone looking for peace and quiet in a beautiful part of the world.",

The beach fronts the lovely property.\nBudi has fastidiously overseen the construction and fitout and the finish quality is superb \u2013 up with any comparable resort we have stayed in.\nThe Villas can also be booked as a single room with shared pool access.\nWayan presides over the delightful and intimate Restaurant, Warung Kepala \u2013 only six tables so service is perfect. Chef, Made, is highly experienced in big hotel kitchens \u2013 menu and food is fantastic.\nSpa treatments are most relaxing in the Villas own Kubu Spa facility \u2013the traditional Balinese massage is a must!\nBudi is a very knowledgeable Tour Guide and showed us much of the spectacular Mountain scenery, temples and local markets in the area.\nScuba diving and snorkelling are right there, five steps in front of the Villas \u2013 great coral and a kaleidoscope of sealife. A scuba diving facility is right next door to Villas Tejakula.\nWe were made extremely welcome by Budi and Wayan, and their ever smiling staff. They invited us to their Hindu Prayer ceremony at the local village \u2013 a highlight of our stay.\nBudi can arrange for your pick up and return from Dempasar area \u2013 that spectacular run up through Ubud was most enjoyable and an adventure in itself.\nIn the future we plan to spend 2-3 days in Seminyak ( friends, shopping, hustle and bustle) then up to the VillasTejukula for a relaxing week enjoying the \u2018real\u2019 Bali. The perfect mix!!\nWe will be booking early \u2013 before this secret gem is discovered.",

              "text": "This Collection of Luxurious Pool Villas, surrounded by tropical gardens, trees and temple will ensure a good nights sleep as you listen to the gentle lapping of the waves along the shoreline. These luxurious villas have a massive central kitchen, dining entertaining area fronting the lap pool. Either side of the kitchen you will find amazing ensuite bathrooms with rain showers that lead to exquisitely furnished King bedrooms.... the first day I slept in, as in addition the the Devine curtains, there are beautiful outdoor blinds that are lowered by the staff at night to ensure you are not disturbed by the sun rising in the east. Every two bed roomed pool villa has enticing gardens and outdoor rain showers. Each villa has their own entrance and small temple where the staff will quietly appear and place beautiful offerings each day. Steps lead to a traditional entrance giving the villas the height to have a low wall at the front ensuring stunning views of the ocean from the garden, bedrooms and kitchen. The green lawns and beautiful pathways lead you to the ocean seating area, via the garden to the resorts own spa and Warung that has such delicious food at great prices. Try snorkelling and do not be fooled by the black sand and smooth black pebbles they are the perfect background to show the fish and coral in crystal clear water. We enjoyed a day on the water in the Villas private boat launched for your pleasure from the garden area to the great excitement of local children and families enjoying the cool ocean breeze further along the shoreline. Sit In the Warung and catch up with friends at home on the fabulous free WiFi, whilst sipping on Bali coffee or perhaps a Gin and tonic.... as you watch the gentle waves roll in and colourful fishing boats glide by. A few other dive boats arrive and pick up moorings but you are spoilt, just walk down the steps and float across the smooth black peppbles using goggles and snorkel available at the Villas Warung..... shower by the seaside before heading up to enjoy your delicious complementary breakfast... Pictures and words cannot describe this paradise. Be entertained as colourfully dressed smiling local families arrive at the temple next door or watch their beautiful processions go by and be delighted by their sense of theatre and fun as they make every feast and celebration one to remember. These Luxury Villas are amazingly priced for the all the little extra inclusions provided.  The staff cater to your every need and include you in the village functions by invitation, even providing the customary costumes.",

There are four individual villas in the complex, each with separate amenities including swimming pools, and each displaying a fine appreciation for detail and an architectural simplicity and style that sits well with their surrounds. My villa was well appointed with high quality fittings and features and included a well fitted out kitchen and living area, large bedrooms with enormous en-suite bathrooms and most things needed for a relaxing and peaceful break.  The villas are only 20 meters from the shore where sea life is in abundance,  and certainly within easy reach for both the novice and experienced alike. \n\nThe Villas Tejakula would not suit those looking for bars or restaurants, but would certainly suit those who want a quite destination with a difference with well designed and considered accommodation.",

Bereits bei der Ankunft wurden wir herzlichst empfangen und Budi zeigte uns unsere Villa. Wir hatten eine 2-Bedroomvilla gebucht und f\u00fchlten uns sofort wie zuhause. Jeder der vier Villenkomplexe beinhaltet zwei identische Schlafzimmer und Badezimmer, alles sehr sauber und mit allem ausgestattet was das Herz begehrt. Der gemeinschaftliche Wohnbereich ist offen und gro\u00dfz\u00fcgig gestaltet, mit gro\u00dfem K\u00fchlschrank, Wasserkocher, Essbereich und gem\u00fctlicher Sitzecke. Der K\u00fchlschrank wird t\u00e4glich mit kostenlosen Wasser und Bier/Softdrinks (gegen ein geringes Entgelt) gef\u00fcllt. Im Aussenbereich liegt der wirklich gro\u00dfe Pool, mit Liegest\u00fchlen und Sonnenschutz. \nDie Ruhe, die Privatsph\u00e4re und die famili\u00e4re Betreuung haben uns komplett \u00fcberzeugt.\n \nZum Kulinarischen: Das im Unterkunftspreis enthaltene Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck (frische S\u00e4fte, Obstteller, Eierspeisen, Toast und Marmelade) ist sehr lecker. Gegen sehr kleines Geld kann auch jederzeit noch Zus\u00e4tzliches bestellt werden.\n\nFr\u00fchst\u00fcck mit Blick aufs Meer, ohne Massentourismus, einfach unbezahlbar.\n\nF\u00fcr Lunch und Dinner k\u00f6nnen wir es nur jedem ans Herz legen - geht in den zum Resort geh\u00f6renden Warung Kelapa! Das Essen ist phantastisch, es gibt viele balinesische K\u00f6stlichkeiten, die in dieser originalen Form in keinem der Touristenzentren geboten werden. Im Oktober war wenig los und jeden Abend wurde uns eine balinesische Spezialit\u00e4t f\u00fcr den n\u00e4chsten Tag empfohlen - und jedes Abendessen war ein echtes Highlight. Auf keinen Fall den Kokosnuss-Pancake verpassen, er ist die S\u00fcnde wert!\n\nWayan und Budi, die Betreiber des Resorts k\u00fcmmern sich mit Herzblut um ihre G\u00e4ste! Jederzeit zu einem Plausch bereit, sie geben Tipps und Helfen auch immer weiter. Sei es, dass einen eine Erk\u00e4ltung erwischt und oder man spezielle Getr\u00e4nkew\u00fcnsche hat, alles wird m\u00f6glich gemacht. Auch Ausfl\u00fcge in die wundersch\u00f6ne Umgebung kann man mit Budi buchen. \n\nSelbstverst\u00e4ndlich gibt es auch ein SPA in der Anlage und Iluh leistet dort hervorragende Arbeit! Bereits nach der ersten Massage waren meine Nackenschmerzen fast verschwunden. Iluh k\u00fcmmert sich auch um den Fr\u00fchst\u00fccksservice und auch sie hat immer ein offenes Ohr f\u00fcr Fragen und vermittelt einem das Gef\u00fchl bei Freunden zu sein.\n\nLeider konnten wir aufgrund einer Erk\u00e4ltung meines Mannes das Hausriff nicht erkunden, aber das werden wir n\u00e4chstes Jahr nachholen.\nWir sitzen bereits jetzt vor der Planung f\u00fcr Oktober 2020 und \u201eThe Villas Tejakula\u201c wird auf alle F\u00e4lle f\u00fcr einige Tage wieder unser Zuhause sein.\n\n",

Wayan und Budi sind tolle und herzliche Gastgeber, mit einem sehr freundlichen und hilfsbereiten Team. Die Ausflugtipps sind klasse und top organisiert. Ob Abenteuer und Natur an den Wasserf\u00e4llen mit Klippenspr\u00fcngen oder Schnorcheltour zur Tulamben, Ubud oder Lovina Beach - alles wird m\u00f6glich gemacht auf flexible und unkomplizierte Weise.\nEs ist eine perfekte Mischung aus Unternehmungsm\u00f6glichkeiten und der Ruhe und dem Charme der Villas.\nDer benachbarte Tempel tr\u00e4gt ebenfalls zum Charme bei und hat uns in keinster Weise gest\u00f6rt, im Gegenteil.\nUnd zu den H\u00e4hnen in der Nachbarschaft: Ja, sie kr\u00e4hen am Morgen, aber erstens nicht sehr lang und zweitens l\u00e4sst sich dennoch bestens weiterschlummern.\nEine klare Empfehlung und nochmal ein herzliches Dankesch\u00f6n an Wayan, Budi und das ganze Team.",

              "text": "Wie \u00fcberall ersichtlich liegt die Anlage recht abgelegen im Norden Balis. Wir haben uns bewusst f\u00fcr diese Gegend entschieden. \n\nDie Pflanzen und Tiere (V\u00f6gel baden im Pool, Haie und Delphine im Meer) haben wir sehr bewusst genossen und fanden es toll. \n\nSehr sauber und sehr diskretes Personal. Ausserhalb ist es sehr dreckig. Die Menschen auf Bali lassen ihren Plastikm\u00fcll \u00fcberall liegen oder sie verbrennen ihn. Daher stinkt es abends sehr in der Anlage.\n\nDie Gastgeber sind auch nett und erf\u00fcllen alle W\u00fcnsche. \n\nUns war die Art aller Menschen auf Bali manchmal zu neugierig. Aber das kann auch an uns liegen. Man muss offen f\u00fcr andere Kulturen sein. Ich bin nicht so der Typ, der sich f\u00fcr seib Leben und seine Tagesgestalltung rechtfertigen m\u00f6chte.\n\nNeben dem Hotel leben sehr viele H\u00e4hne.  Leider wecken diese die G\u00e4ste ab 4 Uhr morgens. Das nervt irgendwann sehr.\n\nNebenan ist ein Tempel auch dieser macht L\u00e4rm. Also komplett still ist es nicht, daf\u00fcr hat man durch die Mauern viel Privatsph\u00e4re. \n\nWir hatten aufgrund der Homepage die Hoffnung viel Schnorcheln zu k\u00f6nnen. Das ging aufgrund des Wetters nur selten. \nInsgesamt hat uns die Unterwasserwelt entt\u00e4uscht. Aber das ist nicht Problem des Hotels.\n\nEinstieg ins Meer recht schwierig. \n\nDie Ausfl\u00fcge sind super.\n\nMan muss sich bewusst sein, dass man nirgends hinkommt ohne Fahrer.\n\nDas Restaurant war nicht so unser Geschmack . Wir waren oft nebenan im Hotel. Die Karte ist gr\u00f6\u00dfer und es schmeckt besser.\n\nMein Kritikpunkt: es heisst, dass Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck inklusive ist. Es ist ein Toast und Obst inklusive. \nM\u00f6chte man ein Ei oder andere Dinge als Toast und Marmelade muss man zahlen. \nDas finde ich nicht so ganz in Ordnung (Werbung sagt was anderes)\n\nAlso durchaus eine Reise wert, aber nach einer Woche hat man sich durch die Karte gegessen und ist ausgeruht genug. \n",

              "text": "Wer Trubel, Souvenir-Shops und Massagesalons an jeder Ecke sucht, ist in dieser Ecke von Bali falsch. (Ein Spa f\u00fcr Massagen ist aber direkt im Ressort zu finden). Daf\u00fcr bietet dieses wundersch\u00f6n und liebevoll gestaltete Ressort die M\u00f6glichkeit, ein St\u00fcck weit authentisches Bali kennenzulernen und die Seele baumeln zu lassen. Die Villen sind balinesisch eingerichtet und laden mit eigenem (gro\u00dfen) Pool wundervoll zum Entspannen ein. Direkt vor der T\u00fcr ist das Meer mit zwei sch\u00f6nen Hausriffs, wer tauchen gehen will, findet direkt nebenan eine deutsche Tauchschule. Wir sind zum Essen bis auf eine Ausnahme im hauseigenen Warung Kelapa geblieben, das wirklich leckeres Essen und charmantes Personal zu bieten hat (siehe gesonderte Bewertung zu Warung Kelapa). Wayan und Budi, denen die Villen geh\u00f6ren, und ihr Team sind herzlich, gastfreundlich, geben (wenn gew\u00fcnscht) Tipps f\u00fcr Ausfl\u00fcge, die man im Hotel buchen kann, und k\u00fcmmern sich toll, man ist wirklich in guten H\u00e4nden dort. Wir haben zwei Tagesausfl\u00fcge gemacht, da wir keinen Roller hatten und fu\u00dfl\u00e4ufig nicht viel erreichbar ist (auch zu ATMs muss man fahren oder man tauscht Bargeld direkt bei Wayan und Budi), und k\u00f6nnen auch die Ausfl\u00fcge sehr empfehlen. Noch ein Tipp, wenn ihr euch f\u00fcr Umweltthemen interessiert: Nicht weit entfernt ist LINI (findet ihr bei AirBnB), die bedrohte Fischarten (u.a. auch diverse Arten von Clownfischen) nachz\u00fcchten und sich um den Aufbau neuer Korallenriffe k\u00fcmmern (man darf sogar selbst beim Bauen an Land helfen). Wir haben uns in Tejakula sehr wohl gef\u00fchlt und kommen gerne wieder!",

Wayan und Budi k\u00fcmmerten sich sehr pers\u00f6nlich um uns. Das gesamte Personal ist sehr motiviert und freundlich. F\u00fcr unsere Ausfl\u00fcge nutzten wir das Auto mit Fahrer Gede vom Hotel. Mit  Gede konnten wir sehr individuell viel erkunden und haben viel interessantes kennen gelernt.\nDie Hotelanlage liegt direkt am Meer, ist \u00fcberschaubar . Der Garten ist mit viel Liebe angelegt und in sehr gutem Zustand.\nDa leider das Meer etwas unruhig, war konnte ich mit Gede auch nach Amed zum Schorcheln fahren - mit sehr sch\u00f6nen Korallen.\nBei ruhiger See sind die Korallen vor dem Hotel sehr sehr eindrucksvoll.\nWir f\u00fchlten uns sehr gut aufgenommen - wie zu Hause - ein gro\u00dfes Danke an Wayan mit Budi und der gesamten Crew!!!",

Unter anderem \"The Villas\", weil es so sch\u00f6n weit oben im Norden war und mit ausgezeichneten Bewertungen aufwartete. Und ich kann es bereits jetzt vorweg nehmen: Die Bewertungen haben nicht gelogen!\n\nThe Villas ist ein einfacher traumhafter, kleiner Spot direkt an der K\u00fcste. Sobald man \u00fcber die kleine Stra\u00dfe angekommen ist, merkt man sofort, dass es sich hier nicht um ein 08/15-Hotel handelt, sondern das es einen ganz besonderen Flair hat. Dabei kommen die Anspr\u00fcche an eine gute Unterkunft mit entsprechenden Extras nicht zu kurz, aber halt ganz anders als man es sonst gewohnt ist. Die herzliche Art der Mitarbeiter, die sp\u00fcrbare Freude mit der sie ihrer Arbeit nachgehen sowie die einfach himmlische Ruhe l\u00e4sst einen einfach wunderbar runterfahren und sich erholen.\n\nF\u00fcr jeden, der auf Bali auch etwas entspannen will und mit Ruhe keinerlei Probleme hat, sollte hier auf jeden Fall vorbeischauen. Absolut empfehlenswert - und das mit allen Extras, die man braucht!!!",

Auch der Garten, wo sich das zum Hotel geh\u00f6rende Restaurant 'Warung Kelapa' befindet, ist pardiesisch sch\u00f6n und die Speisen sind soooooo lecker! Das T\u00fcpfchen auf dem i bildet das intakte und zum Gl\u00fcck gesch\u00fctzte Hausriff!!! Wir haben Stunden mit schnorcheln verbracht! Speziell hervorheben muss man aber auch das Team um Wayan und Budi! Alle sind jederzeit freundlich und hilfsbereit! Man wird von Wayan und Budi liebevoll umsorgt und daher fiel es uns nicht leicht, uns von ihnen und dem wunderbaren Fleckchen wieder zu trennen! Nochmal herzlichen Dank dem 'The Villas Tejakula'-Team und bis bald!!:)",

              "text": "The Villas Tejakula ist in der Preiskategorie 100-140 Euro einfach unschlagbar.\nEs liegt in Norden Balis und das ganze Team macht einen tollen Job.\nDie bereitgestellten Villen sind wirklich der Hammer.\nWir waren zu zweit in einer Villa untergebracht und f\u00fchlten uns wie im Paradies.\nDazu lade ich gleich ein paar Bilder hoch, damit man vesteht, was ich meine...\nNeben den paradisischen Bedingungen, blieben auch seitens des Services keine W\u00fcnsche offen.\nSo bietet das Team ein Servicesorglospaket an. Unter anderem kann man die W\u00e4sche waschen lassen, w\u00e4hrend des Fr\u00fchst\u00fccks werden die Betten neu gemacht und es scheint auf alles eine L\u00f6sung gefunden werden zu k\u00f6nnen.\nAuch zahlreiche Tagestouren zu Wasserf\u00e4llen, Delfinen und Tempeln stehen im Auswahlprogramm.\nSelbst im Worst Case Fall war dem G\u00e4stebuch zu entnehmen, dass das Hotel einen Arzt und Medikamente f\u00fcr eine junge Frau besorgt hatte.\n\nIch gebe f\u00fcr The Villas Tejakula 5 Sterne, weil es einfach eine herausragende Anlage mit herausragendem Service ist. Hier w\u00fcrde man bspw.sogar (nach Absprache) von einem anderen Hotel f\u00fcr eine kleine Geb\u00fchr abgeholt werden (einfach auf der Hoteleigenen Seite anfragen und dann buchen).\n\nkonstruktive Kritik:\nBucht f\u00fcr die erste Massage zun\u00e4chst eine sanfte Massage. Ich hatte mir eine harte Massage gew\u00fcnscht und diese auch bekommen. Das hatte ich falsch eingesch\u00e4tzt und hatte ein paar Tage Probleme mit dem R\u00fccken. Dies war jedoch eine falsche Einsch\u00e4tzung von meiner Seite.\n\nDas Essen ist hervorragend. Habe mich die ganze Karte hoch und runter gegessen. Es war immer toll und g\u00fcnstig. Auch das Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck war reichlich und super lecker.\nEs klingt wie ein schlechter Scherz... aber das einzigste, was ich monieren kann, ist dass der Toast zu sehr getoastet wurde. Ansonsten wirklich alles super.\n\nAls an einem Tag das Wlan ausgefallen ist, haben wir zeitnah einen mobilen Hotspot zugereicht bekommen, damit wir nicht auf Internet verzichten mussten. Das so schnell mit kleineren Problemen eine L\u00f6sung gefunden werden konnte, hat uns schon sehr imponiert.\n\nZusammengefasst ist The Villas Tejakula wirklich ein echtes Juwel, was ich sicherlich nochmals eine Woche buchen werde, wenn ich nochmals in Bali bin.",

              "text": "Wir haben Anfang M\u00e4rz 2018 einen wundervollen Urlaub in den Villas Tejukula verbracht und k\u00f6nnen alle ausgezeichneten Bewertungen voll und ganz best\u00e4tigen. Wir hatten uns f\u00fcr unseren 2,5 w\u00f6chigen Baliurlaub gegen eine Rundreise entschieden und haben stattdessen vom Hotel aus die Umgebung erkundet. Vor allem aber konnten wir in diesem luxuri\u00f6sen Kleinod genau das tun, was wir uns gew\u00fcnscht hatten \u2013 fernab von allem Trubel einfach die Seele baumeln lassen.\n\nDie Villas Tejakula liegen in Nordbali (in Penuktukan), welches im Gegensatz zum S\u00fcden nicht vom Tourismus gepr\u00e4gt ist. Am Meer nach links schlie\u00dfen sich zwei weitere, \u00e4hnlich kleine Hotels an, ebenso wenn man ca. f\u00fcnf Minuten nach rechts geht. Ansonsten ist die Umgebung vor allem landwirtschaftlich gepr\u00e4gt, touristische Infrastruktur sucht man vergeblich.\n\nWir haben aber, vor allem wegen des exzellenten Angebots im eigenen Hotel, nichts vermisst. Aufgrund der abgeschiedenen Lage haben wir daf\u00fcr aber einen authentischen Einblick in das Leben vor Ort bekommen. So konnten wir z.B. \u2013 angemessen eingekleidet vom Hotel \u2013 an einer Hindu-Zeremonie zu Vollmond im Ort teilnehmen, bei der wir sogar eine Mitarbeiterin des Hotels trafen, die uns alles genau erkl\u00e4rte. Die Bewohner der umliegenden D\u00f6rfer sind uns jederzeit sehr freundlich begegnet und haben uns das Gef\u00fchl gegeben, Teil der Gemeinschaft zu sein. Individuelle Tagesausfl\u00fcge k\u00f6nnen mit dem hoteleigenen Kleinbus unternommen werden (ca. 50\u20ac pro Tag inkl. Fahrer).\n\nWir hatten ansonsten ein wenig Bedenken, dass die eingeschr\u00e4nkte Restaurantauswahl die Mahlzeiten eint\u00f6nig oder teuer macht, aber das war beides nicht der Fall. Im Gegenteil, das Essen im hoteleigenen \u201eWarung Kelapa\u201c war so gut und preiswert (ca. 3-6 Euro f\u00fcr ein Hauptgericht, Wasser gratis), dass wir von \u201eGado Gado\u201c, Fisch usw. gar nicht genug bekommen konnten! Auch als Vegetarier l\u00e4sst es sich sehr gut aushalten. Das Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck ist mit Obst und M\u00fcsli, Toast und Eiern, Pancake, Saft und Kaffee/Tee sehr lecker und ausgiebig. Der Blick vom Restaurant in den wundersch\u00f6nen Garten und auf\u2018s Meer ist herrlich. Ebenfalls sehr genossen haben wir Iluhs hervorragende Massagen im hauseigenen Spa (ca. 16 Euro pro Stunde).\n\nEin Sturm hat in den Neunzigern einiges an Land abgetragen, weshalb eine Steinmauer zum K\u00fcstenschutz angelegt wurde. Man kann auf der Mauer ganz gut spazieren und direkt vom Hotel ins Wasser gehen, wo steiniger Untergrund ist (daher Badeschuhe empfehlenswert). Der fehlende Sandstrand ist nat\u00fcrlich ein Manko, wurde aus unserer Sicht aber vom direkt vor der Haust\u00fcr befindlichen Riff wettgemacht; au\u00dferdem l\u00e4sst es sich auch auf den Liegen im Garten mit Blick auf\u2019s Meer sehr gut aushalten. Wir waren fast t\u00e4glich schnorcheln und haben dabei viele tropische Fische sowie eine Schildkr\u00f6te gesehen. Das Riff ist in sehr gutem Zustand und es kommen sogar Tagestouren aus anderen Regionen extra angereist. Direkt nebenan im \u201eTeluk Karang\u201c Hotel gibt es eine Tauchschule unter deutscher Leitung, in der wir einen sehr empfehlenswerten Schnupperkurs gemacht haben.\n\nDas Hotel selbst ist au\u00dferordentlich geschmackvoll und mit einer unglaublichen Liebe f\u00fcr\u2019s Detail eingerichtet (z.B. Pool-Nudeln, Taschenlampe, Sarongs, Regenschirm im Zimmer verf\u00fcgbar). In der Villa entfalten insbesondere die handgearbeiteten balinesischen M\u00f6bel, der gro\u00dfe offene Wohnbereich mit eigener Stereo-Anlage und die Frangipani-B\u00e4ume einen ganz besonderen Charme; einen privaten Pool von dieser Gr\u00f6\u00dfe haben wir als reinen Luxus empfunden.\n\nHerausragend an den Villas Tejakula ist aber vor allem auch das Team um Wayan und Budi, das zu jeder Zeit auf freundschaftliche Art und Weise darum bem\u00fcht war, unseren Aufenthalt so angenehm wie nur m\u00f6glich zu gestalten. Auch hier machen viele kleine Dinge den Unterschied zum perfekten Urlaub \u2013 z.B. wurde unsere Villa IMMER w\u00e4hrend wir beim Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck waren gereinigt, um uns ein Maximum an Privatsph\u00e4re zu gew\u00e4hren. Vom G\u00e4rtner bis zum Restaurantbetrieb hat dabei alle Mitarbeiter eine unaufdringliche Professionalit\u00e4t ausgezeichnet, wie sie in manchem F\u00fcnf-Sterne-Hotels ihresgleichen sucht.\n\nEs wird f\u00fcr uns immer ein unvergesslicher Urlaub bleiben!",

Toll!!!!!\nBei unserer Ankunft eine herzliche Aufnahme durch Budi, der ein wenig traurig ist, weil durch den Vulkan G\u00e4ste ihre Buchungen stornieren!!!\nEr freut sich einfach auf jeden Gast und steckt viel Herzblut in seine Arbeit!!!\nWir sind positiv \u00fcberrascht von den tollen Villen, mit dem riesigen Wohnbereich mit K\u00fcchenzeile und der duftenden Bepflanzung rund um den Pool der Villa!!! Alles perfekt sauber!!!\nDie Villen sind toll eingerichtet und haben sch\u00f6ne B\u00e4der!\nEs gibt eine kleine Spa Villa f\u00fcr Massagen!\nEin wundervolles Restaurant liegt gegen\u00fcber! \nDort bekommen wir jeden Morgen ein tolles Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck mit den besten \u201eBANANA-Pancakes!!! \nDer Service ist einfach super und f\u00fcr jeden Spa\u00df zu haben. Als wir aus Pina Colada\nMango-Colada machen wollen, sorgt das f\u00fcr viel Heiterkeit!!!! Und Wede hat es sofort beim ersten Mal perfekt hinbekommen!!!! Versteckte Talente;-) ! Das Abendessen ist ebenfalls super( mehr dazu in der Bewertung zum Restaurant).\nDer Strand ist ein schwarzer Sandstrand mit vielen gro\u00dfen Steinen!!\nBadeschuhe sind empfehlenswert. Man kann toll Schnorcheln und sieht bereits im flachen Wasser viele Fische!!!\nBudi und Wayan sind immer wieder da und fragen nach dem Befinden oder Pl\u00e4nen f\u00fcr den Tag!!!!!! Das macht das ganze so famili\u00e4r!!!\nWir haben die Woche absolut genossen. \nUnbedingt mal fr\u00fch aufstehen und auf den morgendlichen Markt gehen!!\nDie Einheimischen freuen sich sehr \u00fcber fremde neugierige Besucher. \n\u00dcberhaupt sind die Bewohner rings herum toll. Freundlich und l\u00e4chelnd und nicht so \u00fcberdr\u00fcssig der Touristen. Es sind hier eben nicht so viele!!\nDer Abschied fiel uns schwer! Wir haben tolle Menschen getroffen, der G\u00e4rtner der ganz ruhig und immer l\u00e4chelnd einen tollen Job macht. Ketut, der stets bem\u00fcht ist den G\u00e4sten Die balinesische Sprache n\u00e4her zu bringen und Darma, der im Restaurant f\u00fcr viel Spa\u00df sorgt!!!!!\nMir bleibt hier nur die Daumen zu dr\u00fccken, da\u00df bald wieder ganz viele Menschen nach Bali fahren!!!! Und wenn ich einen Wunsch frei habe dann baut doch noch einen Steg ins Meer ;-)",

              "text": "Wir verbrachten mit unserer zehnj\u00e4hrigen Tochter zweieinhalb Wochen in einer der Villen; Ankunft und Abreise h\u00e4tten unterschiedlicher kaum sein k\u00f6nnen:\nNach 26 Stunden Hinweg nonstop waren wir so geschlaucht und m\u00fcde, dass zuerst gar keine Begeisterung aufkam und wir schon sicher waren, eine so weite Reise nicht wieder machen zu wollen. Bei der Verabschiedung dagegen hatten wir Tr\u00e4nen in den Augen, weil wir unsere Gastgeber so sehr ins Herz geschlossen und uns zudem wunderbar erholt hatten. \nDie Anlage  ist mit 4 Villen (Belegung je maximal 4 Personen) klein und sehr ruhig; dadurch entwickelte sich mit der Zeit auch zu den sehr herzlichen Angestellten ein geradezu freundschaftlich-famili\u00e4res Verh\u00e4ltnis. Dharma, der uns auch einige balinesische W\u00f6rter beibrachte, ist der sympathischste Kellner, den wir je kennengelernt haben. An seine aufrichtig-freundliche Art werden wir noch lange gerne zur\u00fcckdenken. Aber auch Wayan und Buddy, die Verwalter der Villen, die uns Ausfl\u00fcge zu verlassenen Tempeln, eine Raftingtour, den Besuch einer Zeremonie mit anschlie\u00dfender Legongtanz-Auff\u00fchrung etc. erm\u00f6glichten, haben und uns durch ihre Fr\u00f6hlichkeit und Unbeschwertheit immer wieder begeistert. \nWir waren sehr froh, unseren Urlaub hier im abgeschiedenen Norden der Insel verbracht zu haben. Bei unseren Ausfl\u00fcgen Richtung S\u00fcden bzw. Inselmitte haben uns doch manchmal die Urlaubermassen an einigen Sehensw\u00fcrdigkeiten gest\u00f6rt. Dagegen war es um Tejakula und anderen abgelegenen Orten so, wie wohl ganz Bali noch vor 30 Jahren gewesen sein soll: Nur wenig Tourismus, Kinder begr\u00fc\u00dfen einen fr\u00f6hlich, die Menschen durchweg freundlich und  zuvorkommend, offen und aufgeschlossen (aber niemals aufdringlich). Einmal zog eine prachtvolle religi\u00f6se Prozession direkt an der Anlage vorbei, und wie selbstverst\u00e4ndlich waren wir willkommen mitzugehen, alles anzuschauen und auch die Hintergr\u00fcnde erkl\u00e4rt zu bekommen.\nFazit: Wir werden immer ein St\u00fcck Bali in unseren Herzen tragen und den wundersch\u00f6nen Urlaub sicherlich nie vergessen.\nHier noch ein paar Tipps nach unseren Erfahrungen:\nStop-Over auf Hin und R\u00fcckreise einplanen (Unseren R\u00fcckweg mit Stop in Singapur fanden wir wesentlich angenehmer als den Hinweg nonstop)\nL\u00e4ngeren Aufenthalt in den Villas Tejakula einplanen (Das wirklich herausragende an unserem Urlaub hier fanden wir nicht die sicherlich sehr sch\u00f6ne Anlage, sondern die M\u00f6glichkeit, den sehr herzlichen Menschen und ihrer Kultur n\u00e4her zu kommen, was einfach eine Weile braucht).\nNicht zu hohe Erwartungen bzgl. Schnorcheln haben (Wir hatten zwar jeden Tag Sonnenschein und keinen Tropfen Regen, aber auch fast immer Wind am Meer, der dann f\u00fcr Wellen und eingeschr\u00e4nkte Sicht gesorgt hat. An den ruhigen Tagen gab es ein sch\u00f6ne Unterwasserwelt zu sehen, allerdings hat auch hier die Korallenbleiche durch El Nino starke Spuren hinterlassen )\nNicht so sehr nach den Top-Sehensw\u00fcrdigkeiten der Reisef\u00fchrer gehen (Die Menschenmengen beeintr\u00e4chtigen z.B. die Atmosph\u00e4re der Tempelanlagen; ein weniger bekannter, abseits gelegener Tempel  in wundersch\u00f6ner Landschaft hat uns durch seine friedliche Stille viel mehr in seinen Bann gezogen. Budi kennt solche Orte!)",

              "text": "Wir waren insgesamt drei Wochen in den 'Villas Tejakula' und waren schlichtweg begeistert. Es ist nicht einfach, mit zwei Kindern, die auch noch gleichaltig sind, ein Hotel zu finden, in dem alle verschiedenen Bed\u00fcrfnisse der einzelnen Familienmitgliedern erf\u00fcllt werden k\u00f6nnen -- wir haben es hinbekommen! \n\nWir wurden von einem netten Fahrer vom Flughafen abgeholt, der uns schon auf der dreist\u00fcndigen Fahrt zu den Villas die ersten Infos \u00fcber Bali bereitwillig erkl\u00e4rte. Wir kamen sehr sp\u00e4t abends in den Villas an, so dass die K\u00fcche schon geschlossen hatte. Im K\u00fchlschrank unserer Villa stand -- wie mit der Managerin Wayan vorher per Whatsapp ausgemacht -- ein Teller mit frischen Sandwiches und kalten Getr\u00e4nken. W\u00e4hrend unsere beiden Kids (11 Jahre alt) bei noch 25\u00b0 Au\u00dfentemperatur (um 22 Uhr!) gleich in den beleuchteten Pool unserer sehr sch\u00f6n gestalteten Villa sprangen, konnten wir unseren Hunger stillen. \n\nWir verbrachten insgesamt 19 N\u00e4chte in den Villas Tejakula, und ein Tag war sch\u00f6ner als der andere. Die kleine Anlage (f\u00fcr maximal 24 G\u00e4ste) ist mit viel Liebe zum Detail angelegt, mit gro\u00dfen Kokospalmen, Bougainvillien und Lotusb\u00e4umen. Wir hatten eine von insgesamt vier Villen, die jede mit einem eigenen wundersch\u00f6nen Pool sowie mit jeweils zwei Schlafzimmern nebst B\u00e4dern sowie einem offenen Aufenthaltsraum ausgestattet sind. Die komplette Anlage -- die Villen, das zum Resort geh\u00f6rende Restaurant Warung Kelapa, und auch der kleine Massagebereich -- sind blitzblank und wundersch\u00f6n angelegt. Das Managerehepaar Wayan und Budi, zusammen mit den sehr professionell und gleichzeitig sehr warmherzig auftretenden einheimischen Servicekr\u00e4ften, schafften es wieder und wieder, uns jeden Wunsch von den Lippen abzulesen. Ob es um extra Sprites f\u00fcr unsere Kids in unserem Villenk\u00fchlschrank ging, eine besondere Zutat beim Essen, eine kurzfristige Reservierung einer Massage -- alles wurde m\u00f6glich gemacht! \n\nWir konnten direkt bei Wayan und Budi auch mehrmals einen Van samt Fahrer mieten, der uns dann den ganzen Tag umhergefahren hat. Ob nach Ubud mit seinem Markt, zu malerisch gelegenen Reisterrassen, oder einem Hindutempel -- wir konnten so zu angemessenen Tagespreisen ganz entspannt und komfortabel die Insel erkunden.\n\nDas Essen im kleinen aber feinen resorteigenen Restaurant 'Warung Kelapa' war sehr gut. Man sitzt direkt am Meer auf einer kleinen Terrasse, genie\u00dft einen ganzen Thunfisch auf Bananenbl\u00e4ttern mit frischen Gem\u00fcse und Reis, und schaut aufs Wasser hinaus. So stellt man sich das Paradies vor! \n\nWir haben uns mehrere Male im kleine Spabereich massieren lassen. Die balinesische Massage ist ein Traum, und sogar unsere Kids kamen in den Genu\u00df einer Behandlung.\n\nWir sind mit einem weinenden und einem lachenden Auge von den Villas Tejakula weggefahren -- traurig, da\u00df unser Aufenthalt zu Ende war, und freudig, weil wir wissen, da\u00df wir sicherlich wieder dorthin zur\u00fcckkehren werden.",

Wir hatten gro\u00dfes Gl\u00fcck, da die andere Villa w\u00e4hrend unseres Aufenthaltes nicht belegt war, hatten wir die Pool komplett f\u00fcr uns alleine. \nDer Bereich, der einem zur Verf\u00fcgung steht ist sehr h\u00fcbsch und gepflegt. Auch die Villa war sehr sauber und nett eingerichtet. Es fehlt an absolut nichts. Wir haben noch nie einen so entspannten Urlaub erlebt. \nDas Bad und die tolle offene Dusche sind ein echtes Highlight. \n\nDie beiden Gastgeber Budi und Wayan sowie alle Mitarbeiter sind absolut freundlich und zuvorkommend. Man f\u00fchlt sich willkommen aber niemals bel\u00e4stigt. Es herrscht eine sehr herzliche und authentische Atmosph\u00e4re.\n\nSehr gut gefallen hat uns auch das hoteleigene Restaurat Warung Kelapa. Alle Speisen die wir probiert haben, schmeckten hervorragend. Urspr\u00fcnglich hatten wir vor, auch hin und wieder au\u00dferhalb zu essen, aber da das Restaurant so toll war, a\u00dfen wir schlie\u00dflich jeden Tag dort.\nAlle Speisen, auch das Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck, werden stets frisch zubereitet. Selten waren wir so zufrieden mit einem Restaurant. Die Preise sind f\u00fcr europ\u00e4ische Verh\u00e4ltnisse g\u00fcnstig.\nMan sitzt zum Essen direkt am Meer. Hier befinden sich auch einige Liegen, die man alternativ zu dem privaten Poolbereich nutzen kann. \n\nInsgesamt ist die Anlage zwar sehr klein aber sehr durchdacht. Es fehlt wirklich an nichts und die beiden Gastgeber sind absolut hilfsbereit und sehr bem\u00fcht, dass die G\u00e4ste stets zufrieden sind. \nWir haben hier wirklich einen unserer sch\u00f6nsten und entspanntesten Urlaube erlebt. \n\nLiebe Gr\u00fc\u00dfe von Peter und Julia \n\n",

Mais si vous r\u00e9servez qu'une chambre vous devrez partager la villa avec quelqu'un d'autre. Mais les villas sont extr\u00eamement spacieuses, propres, fonctionnelles avec deux chambres, s\u00e9jour ext\u00e9rieur et une grande piscine de 10 m\u00e8tres sur 3. Nous nous sommes r\u00e9gal\u00e9 \u00e0 tous les repas que ce soit au petit d\u00e9jeuner, au d\u00eener ou au souper. Le staff est vraiment genial, serviable et tr\u00e8s amical. Ils organisent des petits tours priv\u00e9s \u00e0 votre guise. Je n'ai vraiment rien \u00e0 reprocher. Aucun d\u00e9faut. Merci pour tout. ",

L'area comune con bar, ristorante e SPA d\u00e0 direttamente sul mare, di fronte ci sono le quattro unit\u00e0 o ville. Abbiamo avuto la fortuna di avere una villa intera a disposizione, ed \u00e8 stato magnifico. Hai una piccola piscina con patio, cucina e living a tua disposizione, pi\u00f9 la camera e un bagno splendidi. Tutto \u00e8 pensato con grande cura e gusto, fin nei minimi particolari, sia strutturalmente che nell'organizzazione. \u00c8 un luogo di pace e armonia, per chi cerca quiete e bellezza. \u00c8 possibile comunque fare gite con autista personale, infatti abbiamo fatto dei giri splendidi in auto, e uno in barca sulla barriera corallina vicina al resort. Forse infatti l'unico problema \u00e8 l'accesso al mare, non semplice, e i ciottoli e fondale lavico, che non danno visibilit\u00e0 all'acqua. \nVorrei dire anche un grande grazie ai due proprietari Budi e Wayan, di una gentilezza e disponibilit\u00e0 enorme, ci hanno fatto sentire a casa. La cuoca Made prepara cibi deliziosi, avremmo voluto portarla via con noi!! Il cibo \u00e8 ottimo, curato e abbondante, sempre! Tutto il personale \u00e8 gentile, disponibile, professionale. La massaggiatrice Iluh \u00e8 strepitosa, ma direi proprio tutti, Ketut che scherzava con noi e insegnava il balinese base, Weda, Gede, Made, Darma, e tutti gli altri, non ultimo il nostro paziente autista! Grazie di cuore a tutti!",

Safe) ausgestattet. Ein TV- oder Radioger\u00e4t sind nicht, WLAN ist vorhanden. Das vom Zimmer abgetrennte Bad ist wunderbar hell und ger\u00e4umig, verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber eine Dusche, zwei Waschbecken mit Spiegeln und Toilette und ist sehr sauber. \nVor dem Zimmer befindet sich eine ringsum begr\u00fcnte Terrasse  mit einem etwa 10 m langem \u2013 sehr sauberen \u2013 Pool. Wenn beide Zimmer der Villa vermietet sind teilen sich zwei Parteien der Pool, was in der Regel aber kein Problem darstellt \u2013 beide Seiten verf\u00fcgen \u00fcber Sitzgelegenheiten und Sonnenliegen, sowie Trockenst\u00e4nder f\u00fcr die Pool-Badehandt\u00fccher. Im hinteren Bereich (jenen Bereich den wir bewohnen) w\u00e4re es sch\u00f6n wenn noch ein zus\u00e4tzlicher Sonnenschirm aufgestellt wird.\nEbenfalls von beiden Parteien gemeinsam nutzbar gestaltet sich der gro\u00dfe Ruhebereich \u2013 gegen\u00fcber des Pools, ausgestattet mit gem\u00fctlichen Sitzgarnituren, Gasherd, K\u00fchlschrank und Utensilien zum Kaffee- und Teekochen.\n\nDirekt zur Anlage dazu geh\u00f6ren der kleine Spa-Bereich \u201eDi Kubu Spa\u201c und das Warung \u201eKelepa\u201c im balinesischen Stil umrahmt von einem liebevoll, park\u00e4hnlich angelegtem, sehr gepflegtem Gel\u00e4nde. Neben dem Spa befindet sich noch ein gem\u00fctlicher Pavillon in dem man gem\u00fctlich relaxen kann. Im Warung Kelapa, mit kleiner Bar, schattigen Pl\u00e4tzen unter Dach oder im Freien mit wunderbarem Blick auf den Ind.Ozean kann man genussvoll fr\u00fchst\u00fccken, einen Snack zu sich nehmen oder das Abendessen genie\u00dfen \u2013 alles in wundervoller Naturatmosph\u00e4re. \n\nDas stets freundliche und immer hilfreiche Personal bem\u00fcht sich permanent darum allen W\u00fcnschen der G\u00e4ste gerecht zu werden. Regelm\u00e4\u00dfig unterhalten wir uns ein bisschen mit den Managern Wayane und Budi (beide verstehen und sprechen ein wenig deutsch) und sind gleichzeitig auch die Besitzer der Anlage und ebenfalls jederzeit Ansprechpartner f\u00fcr die W\u00fcnsche ihrer G\u00e4ste; beispielsweise f\u00fcr die Organisation von Ausflugsfahrten, Schnorchel- und Tauchg\u00e4nge oder Bootsfahrten.\nZusammenfassend w\u00e4re zu sagen, dass es ein wirklich sch\u00f6ner Aufenthalt in den Villas Tejakula f\u00fcr uns war und wir gern irgendwann wieder einmal zu einem Plausch mit Wayane und Budi zur\u00fcckkehren w\u00fcrden. \n\nVielen Dank f\u00fcr alles an Euch Wayane und Budi sowie an das gesamte Personal und alles Gute f\u00fcr die Zukunft.\n\nMatur sukseme !",

              "text": "Die Villas Tejakula sind sehr abgelegen, in einer Ecke wo nichts los ist. F\u00fcr Taucher aufgrund der Tauchbasis im Nachbarhotel interessant. Strand ist nicht da. Badeschuhe sind notwendig.\nAnsonsten kann man sich nur erholen und auch einen digital detox betreiben.\nTV gibt es nicht, WLAN unzuverl\u00e4ssig und sehr langsam, oft gar nicht vorhanden. \n\nDie Anlage ist sehr h\u00fcbsch und in einem gut gepflegten Zustand. \nWir hatten zwei Zimmer, also einen Pool alleine f\u00fcr uns. Das ist prima.\nPool und Haus sind von einer Mauer umgeben, so dass man eine gute Privatssph\u00e4re h\u00e4tte, wenn nicht dauern ungefragt Mitarbeiter kommen w\u00fcrden. \nWir bastelten uns ein DND Schild. Das hat sehr geholfen. Danach hatten wir \"Privacy\". \n\nDas Restaurant ist landestypisch und nicht konstant in der Qualit\u00e4t. Weder besonders gut, noch besonders schlecht. F\u00fcr Europ\u00e4er eher preiswert.\nWir a\u00dfen auch in der Nachbaranlage, dort ist das Restaurant genauso gut (oder schlecht). Aber man hatte etwas Abwechslung. \nEin englisches Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck wird serviert und ist schnell eint\u00f6nig. Erstaunlicherweise gab es wenig reifes Obst.  \nDie Mitarbeiter sind alle ausgesprochen freundlich, aber wir hatten immer den Eindruck, wir w\u00fcrden Verwandte besuchen und nicht zahlende G\u00e4ste im Hotel sein. \nZur Ankunft gab es einen Anpfiff, warum wir zwei Stunden sp\u00e4ter als angesagt - 17 statt 15 Uhr, angekommen sind. Der Chef stiert unangenehm in Dekolltees. Man will immer wissen, was man plant und was man machte ...  Wir f\u00fchlten uns etwas \u00fcberwacht. Alles etwas eng. \nDer Spa-Bereich ist nicht dolle. Da ist die Nachbar-Anlage deutlich besser gewesen, wenn auch etwas teurer.\nEin Problem ist die mangelde Schallisolierung des Zimemrs. Morgens um 5 Uhr h\u00f6rten man via Lautsprecher religi\u00f6se Zeremonien. Danach dann die Putzer oder Nachbarvilla. Und die wilden H\u00e4hne. Ich war immer m\u00fcde dort, weil ich dauern geweckt wurde.\nDie Hygienestandards sollten erh\u00f6ht werden. Handt\u00fccher, die auf dem Boden liegen, werden nicht ersetzt, sondern wieder aufgeh\u00e4ngt. Der liebenswerte Kellner f\u00e4sst das Besteck grunds\u00e4tzlich an der Klinge oder den Zinken an. Auch mit der linken Hand. \nAlle Mitarbeiter scheinen angelernt zu sein. Was sie nicht k\u00f6nnen, ersetzen sie mit Freundlichkeit. \n\nInsgesamt verbrachten wir trotzdem sechs angenehme Tage dort. \n\nWir w\u00fcrden aber nicht noch einmal dort hingehen. Aber in erster Linie, weil die Ecke insgesamt \u00f6de ist, es keinen Strand gibt und keine anderen Restaurants, wo man mal nett essen gehen k\u00f6nnte. Oder gar eine Bar! Und man trotzdem wenig Schlaf bekommt.",

                     "text": "Dear gourmet030,\nIt was disappointing to read your review as it is such a contrast to most that we receive.   I feel that you may not have researched this area of Bali before deciding to travel to the north coast.   We are not in a busy tourist area and therefore there are not shopping areas and lots of restaurants nearby, but this is what we believe is one of our greatest assets - and most guests agree.    \nWe are also NOT a nudist resort and our staff did their best to allow you privacy in the Villa once they realised your preference, but with any accommodation, the rooms have to be cleaned daily (which we tried to do while you were at Breakfast) and the Pool and Gardens also have to be tended.    This was all done with the minimum of inconvenience to you but you were still unhappy.\nWe did have some serious problems with our WiFi while you were with us and most guests were understanding that the problem was not of our making.  This has now been fixed and our connection is excellent in all rooms, the restaurant and down to the beachfront. \nWe have a beautiful beachfront restaurant which you only ate at once and which prepares many different dishes from fresh local ingredients and once again our reviews are a testament to the quality.   White tablecloths - we do not have - you are in Bali and we offer you a Balinese experience but I do not think you were looking for this type of experience.\nTowels that you left on the floor were replaced, but they were not left folded on the bed as when you first arrived, but clean towels were hung on the towel rails in the bathroom.\nWe do not pretend to be anything that we are not, our beach is black sand which comes and goes and we also have black pebbles.   The snorkeling directly in front of our Villas and only 20 metres from shore is outstanding and enjoyed by all of our guests.    Our staff all work extremely hard to ensure that our guests have personalised but unobtrusive attention and in most cases they are rewarded with reviews that acknowledge their efforts. \nWayan Parniti \nManager\n",

(offenbar aufgrund der Regenzeit). Wir haben es sehr genossen, vom liebenswerten Personal schon beim Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck verw\u00f6hnt zu werden. Danke Wayan f\u00fcr dein wunderbares Lachen - das wird uns oft an die drei Tage und N\u00e4chte, die wir bei Euch verbracht haben, erinnern. Auch der Ausflug zu den Delphinen nach Lovina war gut organisiert und wir haben auch viele Delphine gesehen! Das Einzige, was vielleicht zu erw\u00e4hnen w\u00e4re, ist der Zugang zum Meer, der hier nur schwer m\u00f6glich ist (Schuhe erforderlich). Ansonsten perfekte Anlage, ganz tolle K\u00fcche im hoteleigenen Warung Kelapa - auf Wunsch Garnelen etc. war alles vorhanden oder wurde besorgt. Die einzelnen Villen sind gro\u00dfz\u00fcgig gestaltet, vorallem das Badezimmer, der Pool sowieso ein Traum. Unbedingt eine Massage bei Koman buchen, sie ist gro\u00dfartig!",

Nirgendwo auf Bali haben wir uns so wohl gef\u00fchlt, wir haben gleich verl\u00e4ngert.\nDer Service war top, super freundlich, die Zimmer super sch\u00f6n, mit klasse Detaill\u00f6sungen. Wer Erholung sucht ist hier absolut richtig! Die Manager Wayan und Budi sind ein perfektes Team, super freundlich und hilfsbereit, Ihre Angestellten helfen in ihrer \u00fcbers freundlichen Art wo immer es geht.\nDer Strand ist Kies / Stein = Wasser kristallklar. Schuhe empfohlen, da das Riff gleich vor Ort beginnt = super schnorcheln / tauchen. \nDas Essen im angeschlossenen Restaurant unbedingt probieren , einfach klasse!",

Die Unterkunft war wundersch\u00f6n, extrem sauber und bis ins Detail abgestimmt. Der Service war selbst nach europ\u00e4isch gemessenem Standard auf einem wahnisnnig hohen Niveau! Das Essen war top! Jedes Gericht wurde frisch auf Bestellung zubereitet und alles war wahnsinnig lecker. Wir haben uns so wohl und willkommen gef\u00fchlt wie bei alten Freunden und so umsorgt wie bei Gro\u00dfmutter zu Besuch. \n\nWie oft haben wir diesen Satz geh\u00f6rt: \"Warum geht ihr in den Norden, da ist doch nix!?\" Ja- und das ist einfach wunderbar! Wer auf Party und Action steht (warum geht man daf\u00fcr nach Bali??) ist im Norden sicherlich falsch, wer dagegen die Kultur und Menschen kennenlernen m\u00f6chte, fernab von den Touristenmassen und auf Ruhe und Entspannung aus ist - warum geht ihr in den S\u00fcden?? Nach Tejakula war unser Aufenthalt in Seminyak ein wahrer Kulturschock!\n\nTejakula war definitiv das Highlight unserer Bali-Reise, wir tr\u00e4umen noch immer davon! Wir kommen auf jeden Fall wieder!!!",

Bei voller Belegung teilen sich die beiden Villenh\u00e4lften den Swimmingpool und den offenen Aufenthaltsbereich.\n\nDie Manager Wayane und Budi sind sehr freundlich, und helfen wo sie k\u00f6nnen. Ihre Angestellten vermitteln einem das Gef\u00fchl, Teile einer gro\u00dfen Familie zu sein. Ganz unaufdringlich und gewissenhaft k\u00fcmmern sie sich den ganzen Tag um das Wohl der G\u00e4ste. Alles wird st\u00e4ndig sehr sauber gehalten. Die Sonnenblenden werden zum Beispiel je nach Sonnenstand von einem Angestellten positioniert. Das Restaurant ist sehr sehr gut.\nIm Ort gibt es ausser dem t\u00e4glichen Markt nicht viel zu besichtigen. Daf\u00fcr kann man aber wunderbare Ausfl\u00fcge direkt \u00fcber den eigenen Fahrer buchen. Er zeigt einem die besten Pl\u00e4tze, und es l\u00e4sst sich ein sehr individuelles Programm zusammenstellen. Direkt von der Anlage ist ein  Riff zum Tauchen und Schnorcheln.\nWir haben uns sehr wohl gef\u00fchlt, und w\u00fcrden jederzeit wieder in \"The Villas\" buchen.\n\nWir hatten danach noch einen Aufenthalt in einer auch ausgezeichnet/sehr gut bewerteten Unterkunft im S\u00fcden der Insel. Dagegen ist auch nichts einzuw\u00e4nden, jedoch wurde uns da noch mal deutlich, dass der Aufenthalt in Tejakula wirklich ein echter Traum war.",

Ausgestattet mit allen Annehmlichkeiten, u. a. einem Musik USB Stick, der den Alltag vergessen l\u00e4\u00dft und ganz langsam aber sicher das Urlaubsfeeling durchdringen l\u00e4sst. Wir waren mit 4 Personen f\u00fcr 2 Wochen zu Gast und haben uns rundum wohl gef\u00fchlt.  Alles top sauber und gepflegt. W\u00fcnsche wurden gerne erf\u00fcllt. Mit ausgeliehenen  Mopeds erkundeten wir die Umgebung, was nat\u00fcrlich auch mit einem PKW und Fahrer m\u00f6glich gewesen w\u00e4re. Wer einfach nur Erholung und Ruhe sucht, wird hier f\u00fcndig und auch eine entspannende Massage mit Meeresrauschen und Dschungelger\u00e4uchen verw\u00f6hnt aufs Sch\u00f6nste.",

Alles ist hier sehr pers\u00f6nlich und Wayan und ihr Team k\u00fcmmern sich sehr liebevoll und professionell um ihre G\u00e4ste.\nDie Villen und Pools sind traumhaft und absolut empfehlenswert. Jeden Tag wird mehrmals nachgeschaut ob alles in Ordnung ist ohne das man sich als Gast in seiner Privatsph\u00e4re gest\u00f6rt f\u00fchlt. Auch das Restaurant k\u00f6nnen wir nur w\u00e4rmsten empfehlen. Wir haben letztendlich jeden Tag im Restaurant auch zu Abend gegessen.\nEbenfalls erw\u00e4hnenswert ist der kleine Spa im Hotel. Wir hatten jeden Tag unsere Massagen welche letztendlich auch recht g\u00fcnstig waren.\n\nFazit: dieses kleine Hotel ist f\u00fcr jeden Reisenden geeignet der Wert legt auf: Stiel, Privatsph\u00e4re, leckeres Essen, Ruhe, professionelle Betreuung mit \"Human Touch\" (Vielen Dank an Wayan und ihr Team!).\nWenn wir wieder nach Bali reisen werden wir auf jeden Fall wieder ein paar Tage hier verbringen.",

Jeweils zwei Villen teilen sich einen Pool und einen \u00fcberdachten Bereich mit K\u00fcche und Sitzgelegenheiten. Wir hatten Gl\u00fcck, die zweite Villa war nicht belegt, so hatten wir einen wundervollen \"Privatpool\". Das zur Anlage geh\u00f6rende Restaurant \"Warung Kelapa\" bietet einen Blick auf's Meer. Es gibt keinen Strand, aber direkt vor dem Ufer ein sehr sch\u00f6nes Riff (und ein Zweites keine Hundert Meter entfernt), das Wasser war kristallklar, ideal zum Schnorcheln. Die Manager und das gesamte Personal sind \u00e4u\u00dferst nett und hilfsbereit. Eine klare Empfehlung f\u00fcr alle, die es ruhiger m\u00f6gen.",

              "text": "Die kleine balinesische Anlage umfasst 4 Doppelvillen in sehr ruhiger Lage weit ab von den Touristenstr\u00f6men im S\u00fcden. Wer also Ruhe und Entspannung sucht, ist hier bestens aufgehoben. Wir waren hier f\u00fcr 3 N\u00e4chte und wollen keine davon missen. Wayan und Buti, die Manager der Anlage empfingen uns sehr herzlich. Es folgte ein Rundgang mit allen Informationen, die man braucht. Sonderw\u00fcnsche wurden stets erf\u00fcllt. Mein Geburtstag fiel genau auf diesen Aufenthalt. Wayan hatte dies sofort im Reisepass erkannt. So bekam ich nach einer wundersch\u00f6nen Delphintour am Morgen (\u00fcbrigens in einem alten Fischerboot) ein Geburtstagsst\u00e4ndchen von Wayan und allen staffs sowohl auf Englisch wie auch auf Balinesisch gesungen. Wayan hatte sogar den Fr\u00fchst\u00fcckstisch mit einer kleinen \"Happy birthday Torte\" sowie einem Blumenstrauss geschm\u00fcckt. Das Restaurant Warung Kelapa bot alle kulinarischen K\u00f6stlichkeiten. Wir genossen vor allem die Indonesische K\u00fcche. Es war eine Freude. Das Spa in einer kleinen balinesischen H\u00fctte l\u00e4\u00dft keine W\u00fcnsche offen. Damit wir zu zweit gleichzeitig massiert werden konnten, wurde eigens ein zweiter Masseur organisiert. Alle staffs waren sehr freundlich und haben uns alle unsere W\u00fcnsche erf\u00fcllt. \nAuf diesem Wege nochmals herzlichen Dank an Euch alle f\u00fcr diese wunderbaren Tage.\nWir kommen gerne wieder...",

Von der Begr\u00fcssung bis zur Verabschiedung haben die Inhaber Wayan und Budi sowie der ganze Staff uns einen wundersch\u00f6nen Aufenthalt bereitet. Herzlichen Dank! Haben bisher selten eine so sch\u00f6ne, gepflegte und saubere Unterkunft gesehen. Warung Kelapa (geh\u00f6rt zum Hotel) direkt am Meer serviert sehr gutes und frisches Essen. Massage war ebenfalls top! K\u00f6nnen einen Aufenthalt in The Villas Tejakula sehr empfehlen. Wir waren mit Sicherheit nicht das letzte Mal auf Besuch!",

Wir waren von der Location und den Menschen \u00fcberweltigt und sprachlos. Kein Hotel hat uns so geflasht. wir wurden in der kleinen Anlage (8 Villen) aufgenommen, wie bei Freunden und haben uns sofort wohl gef\u00fchlt. Wir haben die Zeit in der sehr geschmacksvoll und mit Liebe zum Detail eingerichteten Villa sehr genossen. Alles hat gepasst und die immer freundlichen Mitarbeiter haben uns die W\u00fcnsche von Augen abgelesen. Wir haben die Zeit hier zur Entspannung am privaten Pool und mit Massagen (werden vor Ort angeboten) genutzt. \nWer einen wei\u00dfen Sandstrand sucht, wird hier nicht gl\u00fccklich. Aber die gesamte ruhige und gepflegte Anlage und auch die vor Ort angebotenen Ausfl\u00fcge, lassen fast keine W\u00fcnsche offen. Und auch Schnorcheln oder Tauchen vor Ort ist m\u00f6glich.  \nEs war einfach herlich! Wir w\u00fcrden diesen Ort sofort wieder buchen. Und dann f\u00fcr l\u00e4nger. ",

Ein paar Meter zu Fu\u00df zum Strand, ein paar Meter geschwommen, und man befindet sich \u00fcber einem wundersch\u00f6nen Korallenriff welches zum Schnorcheln und Tauchen ideal geeignet ist (eine Tauchschule unter deutscher Leitung befindet sich im direkt neben den Villas). Erholung pur. Hervorzuheben ist die Leistung des Service-Teams: extrem freundlich und hilfsbereit, und das Management - Wayan und Budi - sind extrem bem\u00fcht das sich die G\u00e4ste 100% wohlf\u00fchlen. F\u00fcr Reisende, die abends ausgehen wollen und auf Nightlife Wert legen, so wie beispielsweise in Ubud, ist diese Location absolut nicht geeignet.",

Personalen \u00e4r fantastisk och hotellets egna Spa \u00e4r ett m\u00e5ste. B\u00e4sta massagen vi f\u00e5tt p\u00e5 Bali och det till rimligt pris (ca 200 000). Tyv\u00e4rr h\u00f6ga v\u00e5gor s\u00e5 vi har i huvudsak varit h\u00e4nvisade till den pool vi delat med grannen, poolen var dock ren och fin\u00a0 En dag n\u00e4r v\u00e5gorna var l\u00e4gre kunde vi\u00a0 snorkla vilket var fint. Stranden var vacker men stenig och det kan\u00a0 vara sv\u00e5rt att g\u00e5 i samt komma upp ur vattnet. Rekommenderas att sitta vid stranden och se soluppg\u00e5ngen, magiskt.\u00a0 Hela hotellet \u00e4r mycket\u00a0 rent, snyggt och v\u00e4ldigt smakfullt. Allt genomt\u00e4nkt f\u00f6r att man ska uppn\u00e5 harmoni. Trevlig och god mat serveras i restaurangen som ligger i anslutning. Ett litet minus \u00e4r att jag som g\u00e4st f\u00f6rv\u00e4ntar mig en riktig h\u00e5rf\u00f6n, inte en ynka liten resef\u00f6n. Rekommenderar hotellet till alla som beh\u00f6ver stressa av och komma ner i varv. ",

Wayan og Budi var s\u00e5 s\u00f8de og hj\u00e6lpsomme og alt personalet var ganske sk\u00f8nne. Havde vi fundet dette sted tidligere, var vi blevet meget l\u00e6ngere. Alting fungerede, wifi var god, maden dejlig og atmosf\u00e6ren super hyggelig. Alt i alt en fantastisk oplevelse!",
