We had the entire 5 villa property, my husband and I had the 2 villa area and our guest enjoyed the front 3.  The villas are wonderfully laid out for optimum privacy but also provide generous common areas.  The staff did a fantastic job and the chef made amazing meals for us everyday.  This was a very relaxing vacation, it was so beautiful no one really wanted to leave and explore.  Highly recommend!",

It\u2019s a great location \u2013 next to a famous surfing beach with shops and restaurants in walking distance.  If you need to go further the staff will take you by motorcycle or arrange transport.

I found the grounds and accommodations to be well above any expectation.  Rooms were spacious, well appointed, and air-conditioned, with wonderful bathing facilities au-naturale. This gated estate also features multiple pools which are fresh water and heated perfectly for a swim at any hour of the day or night. A private entrance also will lead one directly onto the beach, and world renown Finns is only a five minute stroll.\n\nBut what really sets of Villa Teresa is their wonderful staff of 14, which includes an executive chef and sous chef. We found all meals here to be comparable or better than any restaurant we visited. Breakfast, lunch or dinner.  You want beer, wine, or hard liquor, it its not in house, the staff will retrieve it for you within minutes. Same with any food item.  Lobster for dinner?  Your wish is their command.  All prepared wonderfully.\n\nMultiple massage areas on property with proper tables and dressing rooms, and they have their own massage therapists on call. 90 minute massages are about $20.  Best massages I can remember.\n\nAlso available for hire is Tiger, your own personal driver with air conditioned car.  He will take you anywhere you want to go, which for us included an overnight to Ubud. He will also meet you at the airport baggage claim, which is a very good idea.\n\nThe chefs and wait staff treated us like family and will also make any reservations for you at local restaurants or salons.  The amazing \"Gold Dust\" salon for facials is only several minutes from the Villa.\n\nCanggu is quickly becoming a hot spot, and new establishments are opening every month.  Amazing Tugu Hotel is only several minutes, as is the superb Como Hotel, owned by the wealthiest man in Singapore. The staff will rush you via the in house scooter fleet to Echo Beach Club for lunch is you wish, literally around the corner. And trendy Seminyak is not far away at all for a day of shopping. \n\nNo reason to stay in an expensive hotel.  Villa Teresa touches all the bases.",

              "text": "There for our 10th wedding anniversary with friends and family for a week. \n\nIf you like upmarket authentic high end Balinese accommodation, this is the place for you. You know the style, thatched roof, beautifully appointed bedrooms, awesome outdoor bathrooms with tubs, 5 seperate villas, two pools, immaculate gardens and great air conditioning. Nothing to fault. At all. \n\nCouple this with discreet staff that you only notice when you need them (how do they do that?), a world class chef on call (Wayan), expertly managed by your friend and mine (Made) and ably supported by Nyoman who is your go to serving guy come butler,  come waiter, come more than able barman (although I did have to teach him the ins and outs of an Old Fashioned, hardly a typical Balinese cocktail to be fair. Keep up the good work mate!) in addition to scooter transport, local knowledge and all round great guy he\u2019s an expert of his craft. When he wasn\u2019t around (does he ever sleep?) the smiling Neeta was on board to care for your every whim. \n\nSeriously, this team is long standing and has it down to a fine art. \n\nIf you get sick of lazing by the pools head on up to arguably the perfect on site watchtower commanding the best view of Canggu beach. Sunset cocktails anyone? Or perhaps a few cold Bintang\u2019s for a chilled afternoon relax while taking it all in? Bliss. \n\nA short walk to Finns Beach Club for those wanting to ramp it up a little, or a slightly longer walk in the opposite direction past a revamped Old Mans along the beach to La Brisa on the legendary Echo Beach (sing it with me now). Awesome surf views from a breezy tree top vantage point. A must see. Great vibe. \n\nAll in all folks... don\u2019t hesitate. You won\u2019t be disappointed. We weren\u2019t.",

It is on a huge block right next to the beach.  Perfect location to walk along the beach to get to Old Man's, Echo Beach and Finn's Beach Club.  Absolutely recommend this place and would love to come back someday.  Staff were very helpful and such a cool place to stay in Bali.  \n\nThank you Yuli and all the staff at Villa Teresa.",

Before we reached, we had no idea that this villa would be so stunningly beautiful, so well located within walking distance to the beach and to restaurants. We did not realize the personal service and care we would get, with a chef and an entire staff waiting on us. This is an estate, with private pool, massage areas, totally private rooms, superb staff. They take care of you every step of the way: Madhe, Nyoman, Neeta, Pushpa, our wonderful chef who cooked lobster and shrimp and even samosas and spanakopita for us. I miss our friendly Nita smiling and offering us morning cappuccino and tea, Nyoman taking our egg orders, the entire staff that waits patiently in the kitchen while you are done eating late at night, or who quickly cleans your room while you are at breakfast. I don't know all your names, but you are truly wonderful. Even the sweet lady who comes and does the daily offerings of prayer, you have all stayed in our hearts and memories. Thanks for a wonderful stay and vacation, for planning our daily trips and getting us pleasant taxi rides, for arranging our massages without leaving the villa. We are overwhelmed, and highly highly recommend this stunning villa. Bali at its very best.\n\nGo with your family, or your friends,  and cherish each moment you have here. Enjoy the sunsets from the lookout tower, go into town, or visit the beach. Or like us, choose to spend a few days in the enclosed estate because it is such a unique and relaxing place. If you choose to visit the temples, go early, because traffic builds up. For meals, seafood, balinese food, and the chicken-veggie samosas were superb (best Nasi Goreng I've had). You even have access to the Echo Beach Club, but we were content to stay where we were. Most likely, so will you.",

I have stayed in some very nice places around the world but never in a villa, so the concept of a chef and butlers was all new to me.  Everything was great including the food, sunsets and the facilities in general.  I loved the Balinese ambiance of the rooms and the grounds.  It was so beautiful and peaceful.  The staff made me feel like a king with their attitude and willingness to cater to my every whim.  It is not really wheel chair accessible which should be considered for those who have this requirement.  The Balinese people are a friendly, warm and courteous and whom I thoroughly enjoyed.  I would like to go back sometime.",

As before, my thanks go out to the staff and the manager.\n\nHere\u2019s a few comments and thoughts:\n\nThis was our third time to the villa, and it seems like each time we go, the Canggu area is getting more and more busy with more spas, boutique restaurants, resorts and gourmet cafes. With progress comes visitors, and they were in no short supply. One area about a mile north, called Echo Beach, has a group of pubs that, by sunset time, are already at \u201cstanding-room only\u201d capacity! I couldn\u2019t believe the crowds. While that was not my cup of tea, i do like the increasing choice of restaurants for those days we don't eat at the villa \u2014 which is not many, as the food at the villa is one of the highlights for us. As there is no real town center, all the shops and eateries stretch along the vast tangle of country-like roads.\n\nI should note that, in spite of the aforementioned increase in activity in Canggu area itself, there are still very few shops or cafes in the immediate area of the villa, and while that makes this area of Canggu beach much less busy, many of these restaurants and cafes are a 10 minute walk or more.\n\nStarting with our last visit, we have tried to so some exploring for some interesting spots on the island. On this last trip, one of their recommended drivers, a jovial fellow named Tiger, took us on a fabulous one-night trip to a hotel high on a mountaintop area near a village called Munduk. It overlooks the north coast of an area called Singaraja. I will try to attach some photos. There appeared to be several choices for hotels [all with their own restaurants]. I highly recommend an outing to Munduk, and I think you could also do this on a day trip with lunch around Munduk.\n\nFor these day trips, it might be helpful if the manager could prepare a list of such outings and include an estimate of the driving times, possible restaurants or possible overnight lodging.\n\nFor me personally, the 3 big highlights [as on our previous trips]: the staff, the food and the ambiance [e.g. the pools, the layout] of this huge villa. The staff always  seem to anticipate what i need before i need it! ... and overall, I simply feel welcome and comfortable.",

              "text": "Stayed here for 2 weeks, my husband and I rented it alone this 6 ps villa to get some well-deserved rest having a very busy business life. \nThis place looks like heaven on earth, really beautiful! Wonderful gardens, lily ponds, flowers and you can hear the sea, The beach itself is not suited to lie on: it is soiled and there are no sunbeds, but it is nice to have a walk or surf. The staff is extremely nice and very helpful, perfect! The house is open and very nice to lay down and read and rest. The sleeping bungalows are nice, however I am not a fan of the open bathrooms and toilets: it is extremely hot: I kept my toiletries in the sleeping room and the mosquitos, bees and flies are buzzing around and I didn't felt quite comfortable to visit the toilet at night. But these all are minor things, don\u2019t come to Bali if you are afraid of bugs, this place is like the garden of Eden.\n\nHowever... the villa is extremely noisy.. Or better said: the villa right next to it \u2013 literally 3 cm - caused enormous trouble during our stay. If you have bad luck, like we did, a group of some very noisy all day drinking Australians sitting on their patio from 9 am till sometimes 4 am (!) yelling, screaming, laughing, playing their music extremely loud.. well.. then you have to say goodbye to your rest!\nUnfortunately we had to complain daily about it and the manager and the staff of our villa tried to stop it. They called and talked several times to the staff and manager, security even intervened several times at night, our manager sometimes had to stay till 1 am to assure to keep the music off, but the next door villa is not really cooperative into getting a (permanent) solution. They couldn't / didn\u2019t control their guests. \nAfter a few days and nights I was so stressed out and disappointed that I even wanted to move into another hotel. Finally, two days before our holiday ended the Australians checked out, they tried to book some more days, but the villa manager denied.. halluleja. However, the same day other guests, a family, checked in and.. they also played their music loud... ;-( I was astonished that the staff of the villa didn't control it. So our villa had to call again, next morning 9 am however I woke up again by the loud music.\nI was so fed up with it! We made a tour our last day, had no energy to deal with this matter anymore... \n\nThe main problem is how the villas are situated next to each other and how it is constructed. The patio of the next door villa is situated next to our garden, pool and sleeping bungalows and it is all open. So every time your neighbors play their music I believe you can hear it even better than they are. You can hear it all over the place. The roofs of our sleeping villas are thin: we could hear literally every word our neighbors spoke. Also there is a beach club nearby which had some party nights you can hear when lying in your bed. But compared to the noise of our neighbors it was a childsplay. \n\nPlease note: I HATE to write this review: it means our holiday didn't gave me the well-deserved rest I really needed and expected from this luxury 11.000 dollar villa we booked. And the staff is really wonderful! \n\nBUT I like to be honest to future guests and I really wish the person who rented it had told us!\nMy husband spent weeks to search something very nice as we are always looking for a quiet place to rest; he even called with the booking company and explicit ask if it is a quiet place, and she assured it was. \nBut it isn\u2019t. And of course some of these things can happen. On the first time: loud music till 1.30 am we thought it was a party, and well, everyone has their holiday and for one night not a big deal. But everyday there was something.. \nMy main issue is: the staff and manager and owner KNOW about these problems! It happens all the time. The owner himself is bothered by the noisy of the other villa and calls them about the noise. And that is my main problem: I, as a guest, had to fight to get some rest\u2026 every day. But as the owner of this villa you must try to assure your guests which you get a lot of money from are getting their rest! Get a permanent solution of this reoccurring problem! Close this patio: make arrangements with this villa; no load sound speakers.. whatever\u2026 but now you made your problem our problem and this not fair! Therefore, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this villa if you like the sounds of nature, birds, the ocean instead of the neighbors music all day. If you don\u2019t mind and you are a relaxed easy sleeper: then go: if you do: please stay away. \nI would never go back, I really was happy to leave and get some rest at home.. finally! \nThis is the only reason for my 3* review, otherwise it would be 5* I was astonished that I seam to be the first guest mentioning the noise, However, I notice a lot of reviews from Hawa\u00ef, the place were the owner comes from. I assume, not sure ofcourse, that friends and family stay here as well, they don't complain obviously. Last thing: I am honest and told the manager already that I couldn't recommend it to others. So.. this is my review, sorry guys! I hope it leads to solving this problem.",

Then off to Villa Teresa where guests are greeted by a professional and attentive (yet unobtrusive staff) offering a platter of freshly cut fruit and squeezed juice.\n\nThe pictures depicting Villa Teresa do not do justice to the actual premises.  The property is aestetically pleasing, well designed (pools, open air massage areas, viewing tower, etc.), clean and impeccably maintained.  Moreover, although the property is next to a flowing stream and public beach, it is private and secure (even from its other guests).\n\nVilla Teresa's staff is at the ready to provide quality meals throughout the day, which often requires a quick run to the local market to pick up fresh ingredients (lobster, fish, etc.).  There are also great restaurants, coffee shops (Villa Terasa also has a first class coffee machine) and even a nice ice cream place in the area.\n\nVilla Teresa is very good about recommending places to eat, visit and get pampered.  In fact, it arranged to have its driver take us to several fine restaurants as well as a mountain hideaway for an overnight stay.    Its staff can also take you by moped to get a manicure/pedicure!\n\nIt was hard leaving Villa Teresa, where its guest are made to truly feel special.  I plan to visit it again.",

Various extremely beautiful flowers and trees are grown everywhere in the gardens. Birds are singing all day. My family felt as if in paradise. In the near vicinity there are lots of good and cheap restaurants and bars. \nThe staff  is extremely polite and provides excellent services. Tasty meals are cooked and served for the guests.  Very, very clean and tidy- everywhere on the grounds of the Villa! I would like to  recommend  strongly Villa Teresa to everyone visiting Bali. Many thanks to all the staff!

The chef was wonderful in meeting all our needs and request for food from adults to children at any time of the day. They made my children feel very welcome and safe.

From the amazing grounds, clean, large pool and plenty of sunbathing options, the spacious and very private rooms everything was better than we anticipated. \n\nBut the real gem of Teresa is the staff. Nita, Nyomen & Wayan in particular went out of their way to make sure our stay was relaxing and fabulous we were a group of 6, celebrating my 50th. The staff decorated the villa as a surprise to me and cooked a traditional Balinese feast. The food Wayan prepared was the best we have experienced in Villa life.  Breakfasts were a leisurely deal, and then we would work out our lunch and dinner preferences. Pizzas or spring rolls by the pool in the afternoon? No problem. Nothing was ever too much trouble.\n\nMade arranged scooters for us, We had massages and treatments in house, all billed to our rooms, we ate and drank like kings and yet when the final bill arrived we were delighted with how little we had spent. Meals are billed at cost price only and so whilst it might cost a little more per night to stay here, on balance its probably more economical than staying cheap and eating out.\n\nThe staff (we called them the ninjas) were so discreet - they made things happen but we very rarely saw them. Our rooms were cool, clean and very comfortable. Our laundry was done, pool towels folded and sun beds rearranged for us.\n\nWe loved Villa Teresa and have recommended it to all our friends who are travelling to Bali.",

The location to the beach, shops, restaurants was perfect. The staff were very attentive and considerate regarding our space. The balance was spot on for privacy and service. \nThe food and beverage logistics were fuss free. The staff were happy to go the bottle shop at any time, even  at midnight after we had over indulged.\nThe grounds were immaculately presented and the sunset tower was a big hit for afternoon drinks and morning coffee surf checks.\nI have stayed in several villas in the area for various events, but Villa Teresa is like a second home.",

We enjoyed the lengthy and spacious sandy beach (Echo Beach).  The viewing tower with its spiraling staircase rewarded us with with a picturesque view of the shoreline.  Away from the hustle and bustle of the popular beach access road, hidden behind a driveway and gate; the villa creates a Shangrila atmosphere.  The name Villa Teresa, which means hidden paradise describes it perfectly.  It is close to everything anyone would want to do: spas, yoga, shopping, great restaurants and coffee shops, interesting and different kinds of nightclubs, and surfing.\n\nThe properties amenities include use of the nearby Canggu Club.  We took advantage of the fitness center and pool.  It's just a short motor bike ride away.  The villa staff take you over on the back of their bike.\n\nThe food served at the Villa is delicious.  We enjoyed and looked forward to the fresh fruit and juices served daily.  There were lots of healthy choices, a nice variety of food served; the chefs were creative, and the presentation beautiful.\n\nThe staff at the villa is outstanding.  They are very helpful and accommodating.  They genuinely care about the comfort of their guests, and pamper them.\n\nWe recommend Villa Teresa because of its location, home cooked meals, cleanliness, and excellent service and amenities.",

If you have ever seen the Movie \"Cacoon\" this is  to what we relate our stay. We felt about 10 years younger after our week of good food cooked by your own chef and massages every day where our therapists came to us at the villa  so no stress of driving anywhere and lovely friendly welcoming staff. owever if you do want to drive somewhere the villa can organize a great driver to take you where ever you wish.\n Villa Teresa has the most relaxing atmosphere situated right on the beach so you can either laze around the pool inside the villa or have a dip in the ocean and go for lovely walks along the beach.\nWe loved the lookout bar in the corner of the villa where we sipped on Gin and Tonics every afternoon and watched the beautiful sunsets. It wasn't just a holiday it was a like a week of anti aging medicine!!! Highly recommend if your looking to recharge or just be totally pampered.",

My friend and i ventured out to some restaurants both nearby in Canggu and a bit further in Seminyak, but back at the villa, chef Wayan never failed to surprise with awesome meals.  They have their own espresso machine, but in the mornings [before breakfast] we went for an early coffee at a nearby bakery, called Monsieur Spoon, as it proved to be quite the center of action and fresh croissants. Locally, Dandelion Restaurant was a great find, and in Kebokan/Seminyak, my favorite was a rib place called \"Hog Wild in Bali\u201d.\n\nThe three things that struck me about Bali island, also struck me about the villa: the natural beauty, the friendly, smiling people and the exotic atmosphere.\n\nI wish i could have spent 2 weeks rather than one, but there\u2019s my excuse to come back!  The layout of the walkways, courtyards, pools, fish ponds, towers and lush abundance of plants and trees was a real stress-melter; I felt like the need to \u201cthink\u201d had been removed from life.  The service matched the food and and exotic setting -- 6-star.  The setting is intimate, and private too, as each bedroom is set in it\u2019s own building.\n\nEvery evening, we were on station for a \"sundowner\" drink at what amounts to your own personal bar and viewing station overlooking the waves and beach.\n\nI guess it's not surprising that others have discovered the Canggu area as we saw hordes of young westerners taking in the beaches, surf and nightlife.  In fact, just 15 minutes along the beach, there is a group of bars and restaurants with standing-room-only crowds taking in late afternoon happy-hours.  While not my style, it\u2019s a good example of the nearby beach life and of the varied things to do.  I was happy that the villa was well separated from all this!\n\nMy only advice is, don\u2019t try to do too much outside, as its just so nice to relax in the expanse of this villa; plus it gives you time for a daily massage.   I can honestly say that i wish i had had more meals, massages and margaritas [the 3 M\u2019s] at the villa and less outings!",

We had awesome massages every day and the food cooked by the chefs was delicious every meal. I highly recommend staying at Villa Teresa with family or a group of friends. The location to other beach side villages such as Echo Beach and Batu Balong was perfect. Will definitely go back there one day. ",

It's open air Bali-style buildings are absolutely beautiful.  Lots of room in the main living area to relax and eat the delicious chef-prepared meals.  There is also a huge TV loft, if you need a tv-fix.  The property has 5 guest rooms and can be sectioned off into a 2 bedroom and a 3 bedroom area, each with it's own common living areas and pools.  We stayed in the 3 bedroom section.  Each bedroom is it's own building with big comfortable beds and sitting areas.  The bathrooms are open air and gorgeous.  The pool is wonderful and if you prefer the beach, it's only steps away.  The staff will cater to your every wish whether you need a car for a day trip or giving you a ride on a scooter to a local watering hole or arranging for a masseuse to come to the villa for a relaxing massage.  Or you can walk the beach and find great food & drink along the way.  Villa Teresa is a perfect vacation get-away.",

Each room is self contained and stands in the very large and impressive grounds. Accommodation is of a good standard, comfortable beds and excellent air con - the bathrooms are outside, which may not be to everyone's taste.\nThe staff are fantastic, always attentive, friendly and reliable they were able to arrange restaurant bookings, taxi, in house massage etc without any trouble. \nFood is taken care of by the on-site chef, who kept us very well fed during our trip.\nThe management were flexible - allowing us to use all of the villa for 3 days, and then just the 3 bed villa for 3 days - they were also flexible on late check out.\n\nI can't really find any faults of note - if I was to be ultra critical, the wifi doesn't reach the pool area, and was sometimes a bit patchy.",

              "text": "My family and I stayed in Villa Teresa for four days.  It was flawless.  We were overwhelmed by the beauty of the property, the above and beyond attentiveness of the wonderful staff, and the attention to detail.  Every space was filled with tasteful, well-decorated Balinese touches.  The food was outstanding - truly restaurant quality at every meal.  We also traveled with an eight-month old infant and the staff exceeded every expectation with regard to keeping our baby  (and therefore, us) happy.  This included holding her and entertaining her during mealtimes.  Some members of our party had never traveled in Asia before and they were especially delighted with the staff.  They were impressed with how genuine and sincere the staff came across.  Although the entire staff was a delight, I would like to single out Ayu and Rossy for their helpfulness.  The property has a fantastic indoor/outdoor design and we loved the blend of modern amenities (satellite TV, wi-fi) and more traditional Balinese feel.  The grounds were always kept immaculate and the staff was extremely discrete.  We also had a special occasion to celebrate during our stay and I worked with the management to make special arrangements.  The results exceeded my expectations.  Finally, I think that staying at Villa Teresa is a good value.  The three bedroom villa section, where we stayed, was huge.  There seemed to be endless comfortable spots to lounge and relax.  The costs of the food and beverages are simply the retail costs of the drinks and/or ingredients.  \n\nThanks to all at Villa Teresa for helping to create lifelong memories for my family stay in Bali.",

              "text": "Villa Teresa definitely lived up to all the positive reviews. We booked the entire compound for 10 adults, 2 toddlers and 1 infant. The physical surroundings were really tranquil--just a minute's stroll to the beach, situated by a river, away from the bustling commercialism of the touristy areas like Kuta and Seminyak. Every corner of the villa was beautiful--we really could not believe all of it was exclusively ours for the 5 days we were in Bali.\n\nThe gorgeous architecture and landscaping aside, I think the real gems are the people who took care of us the entire time we were there, even with our endless requests!! They always served with a smile, and one of the ladies Rossy even cradled my baby to sleep as we ate our lunch! We were amazed at how much effort went into maintaining the villa and catering to our needs; yet the staff was never intrusive.\n\nWe ordered from the Villa menu for most meals, and the cost is pretty reasonable--the Chef would do his grocery shopping at a local supermarket (fancy bumping into him there ourselves!)  and Made the Villa Manager presented the receipts to us at checkout. We only had to pay for the groceries, NO SURCHARGE involved!\n\nIn-villa massages are available from a very affordable USD$12 onwards, and the villa compound is dotted with breezy and comfortable poolside massage verandahs. I really wanted to try the massages but had no time!! If only we had 1 day more...\n\nAll of us had a truly wonderful time at Villa Teresa, babies included. After being so thoroughly pampered, we're really not sure if we wanna go for hotel chains anymore :P",

The three bedroom villa was enormous, with 3 separate sleeping pavilions with outdoor bathrooms, 3 bale-bale in differnet locations around the grounds, a huge upstairs sitting area with balcony and a semi outdoors dining and sitting room downstairs. The pool was also huge and surrounded by lotus ponds and comfy loungers.\n\nBut overshadowing the standard of the villa presentation was the quality of the staff who worked tirelessly to make our stay so special. They were, without exception, all wonderful to deal with, thoughtful and discreet. \n\nThank you to everyone at Villa Teresa who made our first visit to Bali so memorable.",

Villa was conveniently located with a 1-2\nMin walk onto the beach. Only issue being so close was the audible music from the nearby clubs. Thank goodness we had our ear plugs with us. \nWe would definitely return if not for the extremely hard beds they provided. Pillows given were also too high and we had to ask for a change. \nThe dining room and sitting room area was open concept which meant no air -con availability . We had to ask for standing fans to be brought out as the weather was boiling hot. \n\nI wish they would consider changing their beds as that is the only issue we have for not returning again. Having a good sleep and rest during a holiday is of utmost importance to us. \n\nThank you so much for the wonderful staff . They were lovely and very helpful. Hospitality at its best for sure.",

The pictures of the grounds don't do it justice, it needs to be seen in person. The staff is fantastic, they are there for you when ever needed, but discreet and hidden when you don't need them. The chef created world class meals, cocktail service in the tower overlooking the beach at sunset, butler service to fulfill your every need. Massages in the afternoon, I could go on and on about how relaxing and fabulous our stay was, highly recommend Villa Terasa.",

Everyone took such good care of us and we felt like we were family. The location was also ideal as we were walking distance from the beach as well as some of the shops nearby.

Villa Teresa is a gorgeous and meticulously cared for establishment--everywhere you look there are stunningly exquisite details and thoughtful touches that make the villa an astoundingly beautiful place.  From the gardens to the pools, the tower overlooking the beach, and each of the rooms, Villa Teresa provides luxurious comfort in an idyllic tropical setting.  Each of our rooms was exceptionally comfortable, private and quiet, and was fabulously appointed right down to the totally enclosed open-air bathroom complete with soaking tub, stone pillared shower and bubbling water fountain.  However, it is important to say that is was the staff who made our experience at Villa Teresa beyond exceptional--they were always quietly present to anticipate and address our every whim.  They were unfailingly kind, humble and sincere in their desire to care for each of us and meet our personal needs.  Each meal, personally ordered each day, was astoundingly delicious and served family style in the open-air dining area where we would linger, sharing the stories of our day and making plans for the next.  Being in Canggu was the perfect base for travels to see the other various places on the island we visited, from Ubud to Munduk.  I would without fail highly recommend Villa Teresa to anyone looking for a unique and highly satisfying island experience when staying on Bali.  I can't wait to return!",

We ventured into Villa Teresa and I think this response from my mate sums it up \"so this is the resort - in what section is our villa?\" Only to be told that this is in fact the villa that we are staying in. \n\nFrom the time we were welcomed through the front door the staff we affectionately called ninjas were there to cater for our every need.  Simple things from filtered ice in eskys to keep our drinks icy cold beside the pool right through to a secret/surprise Indonesian feast for my wife's 50th. Complex tasks like finding helium in Canggu and finding components for cocktails late at night were always approached with that Balinese can do attitude.\n\nIf you've ever considered a villa for a small get away for 6-10 people through to  them managing a major event you would be hard pressed to find a better team than the staff who have been recruited here over the years - a true test of the owners standards.\n\nWhilst recently surfing in the area 12 months later I took a detour down their driveway only to be greeted with the same smiles that I got when I first met them but it was now complimented with a hug and several glasses of icy cold water.\n\nI consider the staff there, several of whom are now on my Facebook page, to be friends.",

The private villa was a dream, with a heavenly bed and outdoor shower where delightful. Great massages and dips in the private pool.\n\nSpacious and a true place to stay each year for many weeks at a time. You will need at 3 weeks to fully embrace the villa experience and all of the wonderful sights close by. Make sure you make time to ask for Tiger to help you find your way around Bali. There is a nice place to work out a short ride away. Every meal is prepared by the chef fresh and yummy or the tummy. \n\nThank you!!!! Jan, Nugrata and the entire staff!",

The villa is stunning with each \"room\" (like it's own villa within the villa) private, homey and luxurious all at the same time.  The food the chef prepared was wonderful.  We just let him cook whatever he wanted for dinner.  I'm picky for what I eat in the morning, and every morning, they had exactly what I wanted, along with fresh cut up local fruit.  The location is perfect too, as it is close to Seminyak and other popular places, but in its own oasis.  Easy to walk along the beach to Echo Beach with its fun outdoor restaurants and bars. Beautiful spots within the villa with massage tables (masseuse comes to the villa) where you can hear the ocean while relaxing.  Can't say enough about Villa Teresa and my amazing experience.",

Beautiful grounds and our private room  (each room is in a private building separated by about 40 yards) had an outside shower in its own private garden. The gardens and landscaping are magnificently Balinese.  The bedroom bungalows all have air conditioning.  \nWow, we enjoyed massages every other day on lanais set around the pool at a fraction of the cost in the U.S.  You can let them know what you would like to eat each day and the chef will prepare your food and you only pay for the cost of the ingredients.  We also had a great driver (a must in Bali) that took us wherever we wanted to go.  The villa is in a great location for surfing and shopping.  Included in the cost is your option to use the Canggu Club complimentary.  They have a gym, pool, tennis courts and restaurant.  This is a great place to stay in Bali and I would highly recommend it!",

Our villa was just gorgeous, inside & out. Traditional in style with an outdoor bathroom, sunken stone bath tub, open air shower & four post bed with mosquito nets just reinforced why we choose to go back to Bali time & time again. Pure luxury! The staff were fantastic & the food very good, especially the banquet & cocktail bar on the wedding night. You have a choice of 2 pools both of which are huge. The way they have designed the villa complex is just gorgeous. We didn't want to leave!",

I was nervous after booking as I did it all over the internet.  The Villa exceeded my expectations, I find this very rarely happens.  From the moment we arrived the whole experience was amazing the staff were friendly nothing was a problem and the Villa itself was absolutely stunning and well maintained.  It was a real escape from the hustle and bustle of Bali.  It was so close to the beach and the food was excellent, we just picked each night what we wanted the chef to make, they did two sittings one for adults and one for kids.  The price of the food was very reasonable.  \n\nI would not hesitate to recommend this to friends or to book again",

              "text": "Just returned home from our second stay at Villa Teresa and I have to say it was as good as last year. Villa Teresa is situated right on the beach at Canggu just a ten minute stroll along the sand to Echo Beach. Villa Teresa is a place where you can get away from it all, unwind spend your day by the pool with a good book, and soak up the tropical surrounds. Teresa is far enough away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta and Legian, but it is only a 20 minute taxi ride into Seminyak. You have the option of eating in at Teresa or going out elsewhere for your meals, but the chef (Wayan) serves up mouth watering meals from Balinese, Chinese, Indonesian or Western menus. There is staff on hand 24 hours a day, a big thank you to Made and in particular to Rossy who took care of our very need. My wife developed a throat infection during our stay and required medical intervention, with in 5 minutes of mentioning this Rossy she had a doctors appointment booked and a taxi ready to take us to the doctors appointment. \nThe rooms at Villa Teresa a well separated from each other and each room is decorated in a different them, with huge king size beds and at night the only noise you hear is gentle sounds of the waves rolling in.\nThe villa can be divided into two separate villas or if there is enough of you, hire out the enitre villa (sleeps max of 10). \nI highly recommend that you investigate VillaTeresa for your next quiet get away with a couple of close friends as we have, Sept 2012 and Sept 2013.",

              "text": "We had our wedding here and stayed for 3 nights with our immediate families. This villa was an absolute dream, and really lived up to expectations - gorgeous and a true dream getaway!!!\n\nThere's not much I can add here which other reviewers have already said! However, I must point out that for those of you who may be concerned about ethical/responsible tourism and giving back to the local community, this villa is NOT Balinese-owned, unlike what one reviewer claimed. Perhaps that was the case back then, I can't be sure, but certainly when we were staying there, the villa staff informed us that the villa was owned by Europeans.\n\nA few things I noticed which might be important to others:\n\n1. The 'bedrooms' are actually little mini-villas of their own scattered within the compound. So basically each bedroom is an independent, stand-alone unit separate from the others, and not connected via the indoors. I had been expecting one or two big two-storey buildings housing several rooms within it, as that would have been cosier and easier for communication. Not really a negative point, just something to bear in mind as I wasn't expecting it.\n\n2. The villa doesn't quite open onto the beach, and you won't get a beach view from the ground floor. It's separated from the (public) beach by a high wall for maximum privacy, and you access the beach by going through a small, narrow, low door (watch your head!) in the wall. Once outside the wall your view will still be blocked by fishing huts which are literally right outside the villa, and you have to carefully pick your way to the beach via a short footpath that may be somewhat littered with refuse and rubbish (I think mainly from the fishermen) - be careful if you're walking barefoot.\n\n3. It would be good if the toilets could be equipped with hose sprays, bidets or buckets for Asian-style washing and hygiene - which is also in keeping with local Balinese practice. Toilet paper alone isn't enough! Also, in one of the rooms the sliding wooden door separating the bedroom from the bathroom badly needed repairing as it would often get stuck when you tried to pull or push it.\n\nThis isn't really meant as criticisms, just points to bear in mind considering the amount of money you'll be paying to stay here. Apart from these minor points, thumbs up all around - would definitely return if only we could afford it again!",

Let me tell you, the website pictures don't do this place any justice.  They are nice, but the real thing is outstanding.  I have been to Bali a few times and stayed in several villas.  This one was by far the best.  If I come back, I would stay here as my \"home base\" vs. moving around like we have the other times.  It is right on the beach in Canggu (actually through a little gate and about 1 minute walk).  Each bedroom is in a separate building.  All have outdoor bathrooms and air cond. bedrooms.  If you take the whole complex, you have 2 pools.  There are numberous bale balongs and massage areas.  There were 8 of us, but you would never have known it.  The grounds are impressive.  Everywhere you look you see something new- lots of statues, plants & flowers, ponds, and old wooden gates/doors.\n\nThe service was also outstanding.  They did wonderful things for us.  The chef was super nice and accommodating.  We ate there the whole time.  Made (the manager) was great as were all of the staff, so friendly.  Always there, yet unobtrusive.  You should definately have them book the evening entertainment (gamalon and dance), it was a highlight of the trip!!!\n\nI just can't say enough about this wonderful place.  It is about 45 minutes to Ubud, and 1 hour to the Bukit peninsula.  Very convenient to many of the cultural things to do in the area.\n\nVery much looking forward to a return trip to Villa Teresa",

              "text": "We recently stayed in Villa Teresa with a total of two families (4 adults, 3 kids).  We rented the 3 BR villa with one extra bed, and found it to be ideal for our group.  The villa is spacious and very comfortable.  Each of the sleeping accommodations is in a stand alone building, which made for nice spaces for people to retreat to when they wanted privacy.  Yet, the shared living spaces were also pleasant and well used by our group.\n\nThe \"master\" villa is a bit larger than the other two villas, but you don't need to feel like you've drawn the short stick if you stay in one of the others.  They are all very nice, with bathrooms straight out of a dream.  The showers are outdoors, which I personally loved, but if you are squeamish about bugs and frogs and lizards, you should perhaps stay elsewhere.  To me, it added to the overall experience in a positive way, even when I was surprised by a frog hopping through the bathroom.  :-)\n\nWhen we planned the trip, we originally had thought we would take some of our meals in Seminyak at restaurants.  As it turned out, we ate every meal at the Villa.  Chef is excellent, and the meals are a real value.  There is no need to dine out when you get restaurant quality meals in the comfort and privacy of the villa.  You are spoiled beyond belief really.\n\nWe ventured outside the villa a couple of times for tours and shopping, driven at all times by the very able and friendly Ketut.  He makes driving seem simple (no easy feat on the congested roads of Bali) and we felt 100% safe with him at all times.  His English was quite good, and there were no communication barriers at all.  \n\nAll of the staff were friendly and helpful, but never intrusive or in your way.  They managed to maintain a discreet distance, but they were always there when you needed them.\n\nTo give you some idea of cost, I thought I would report on the relative size of our dining and other expenses.  Inclusive of two day driving service ($110 dollars US), rental of one extra bed ($150 US for our time there), the total cost of food, laundry, and beverages (lots of Bintangs!), we spend about $900 US for the 5 days.  If you take out the car and the extra bed, it was about $650 or so.  Considering that there were 7 of us, I think that is a real bargain, as it works out to about $20 per person per day for food and drink.  We did eat mainly \"local\" foods, which are by far cheaper than imported western food.  Be aware that you pay more for laundry than you would if you took it to one of the many places available in the villages nearby, however, it is still ridiculously cheap.  It cost me about $10 to have about 30 pieces of laundry washed, pressed, folded and returned to me smelling heavenly.  They even pressed my sport socks!\n\nIf we ever return to Bali, you can be sure that Villa Teresa will be on our list of places to stay.  You will not be sorry if you select this villa.",

              "text": "We have stayed in many villas around the world and always prefer them to staying in hotels. We also own our own villa in Phuket that we rent out to the holiday market so it is always interesting to see how others operate and run thier own villas and staff. We had stayed in Bali for 2 weeks and spent our first week at Chimeria Villas in Seminyak and decided that Villa Teresa was perfect for our second week. Situated directly on the beach in a remote village the villa is a good 20 minutes out of the way of the happening areas of Bali. This did not bother us at all as we had a full time driver with us for the 2 week period and we loved driving through the countryside to get to the villa. Even though it was only 2 of us we rented the larger 3 bedroom villa and took the advice of other trip advisors. The grounds and gardens are about 4 times the size of the 2 bedroom villa so is the pool and general space. The staff as everywhere in Bali were excellent. They were friendly, discreet and happy. The food was excellent and the menu was vast and everything that we ordered was very good. We actually hosted a friends birthday dinner whilst we stayed at the villa and had 10 friends over for dinner. Many of them own thier own villas in Bali and some of them have several homes across Asia thus we were nervous to host and impress them. The chef did an excellent job and we served a 5 course dinner that everyone truly enjoyed. the cost of the meal was around 150 euro and included lobster, duck and so on as you only pay for thecost of the food... On two occassions we had massages in the garden Bali massage huts and the treatments were excellent....  Just a few small points the villa could be a little cleaner, we had checked in and the upstairs lounge room was messy with oily floors, footprints and dirty windows. One request and the staff soon sorted it out. Again in the walk in wardrobe on the top shelves was dust and we had to wipe them before unpacking our bags. The villa also has no phone and a mobile phone supplied from the villa would have been good. As when you were by the pool or in the master bedroom suite and wanted a drink or attention you had to get up and go and find the staff. Also the swimming pool has black tiles and when we arrived the water was not clear at all. You could not see the bottom of the pool and when we got in it there was green algae on the walls and steps. We informed the manager and staff soon arrived and gave it a shock chlorine treatment and by the following  afternoon we could swim in it. They luckily offered us to use the pool at the two bedroom villa as it was free so we could still swim.. Maybe these small things are not noticed by other people but owning our own villa I really look for details... Overall the villa was much enjoyed and very relaxing, the staff were great and our guests enjoyed the party and we will likely return and use it again.",

              "text": "My girlfriend and I plus her parents came to Bali for a brief holiday in the last week of June and we chose to stay at Villa Teresa. The villa is actually split into 2 villas - one with 3 bedrooms and another with 2 bedrooms. We decided to stay in the 3 bedroom villa even though there were only 4 of us and we only required 2 bedrooms - the owner was happy to oblige by locking the third bedroom. This turned out to be a brilliant decision as the 3 bedroom villa was a lot bigger than the 2-bedroom villa and, in my humble opinion, better value for money than the 2-bedroom villa. \nWe stayed at this villa for 6 nights and we enjoyed every minute of our stay there. The villa is beautiful and well maintained - it is built in a open architecture which made it a very relaxing and chilled out place to stay. It really makes the most out of the Balinese tropical weather. \nThings I liked the best about Villa Teresa:\n(1). the staff. They are an incredibly genuine group of people who are always looking for ways to make your stay in Bali as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. Whilst each individual member of staff was amazing, special mention has to be made for Putu (please forgive me if I spelt the name incorrectly) the car driver - he is a very helpful, street-wise and knowledgeable person who obviously loves his country and culture very much. It was an absolute pleasure meeting him and having many conversations about various topics. He is also a very hard working, honest and sincere man. Also, the chef cooked a lot of delicious meals for us .. unfortunately, I think he was leaving the villa for another job at the end of June 2010. I also want to make special mention of the girls there that worked tirelessly to make us feel comfortable (thanks Rossy for putting up with our numerous requests) and also Made the Villa manager.\n(2). the layout/architecture of the place - very comfortable and a lot of room so that everyone can find some space for themselves if they wish to, even if there were 3 couples there or more. A lot of chillout areas where you can read a book or have a nap in peace. The master bedroom is fantastic whilst the Balinese bedroom is comfortable though not exactly spectacular..again, the design of the place makes good use of the available space and the tropical surroundings. Huge swimming pool in the villa makes it such a pleasure to go swimming!\n(3). location - right on the beach and next to a river. Also its in sleepy Canggu which is a great alternative if you do not want to be in the middle of the action as it is close enough to places like seminyak that it does not take much effort or costs to get there. \n(4). the staff - I cannot say enough about the people that work at Villa Teresa. They are awesome!\nThings I liked the least about Villa Teresa - there isn't much I did not like about Villa Teresa but if I HAVE to find something to fault about it, I would say that I could have done with a better shower in my room. My girlfriend and I stayed in the Balinese bedroom (not the master bedroom) and the outdoor shower lacked power - at times, the water seemed to trickle out of the shower head and if there was a slight wind the water could get blown in a different direction away from you. I only mention this because I like showers with a powerful jet - this is not a big deal and not a 'game changer'.\n\nWe had a fantastic holiday in Bali staying at Villa Teresa and I would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone going to Bali for a chilled out holiday. I will most definitely consider staying here again the next time I visit Bali.",

              "text": "ABSOLUTE PERFECTION part of a just back report I wrote upon arriving home:\n\nVILLA TERESA:\nWow wow and wow after a warm welcome we were ushered into the main living area for cool watermelon juice, cold towels and fruit. It's like we have hit an oasis! Nugrata the villa owner and Made the manager then showed us through the rooms and oh my god we are actually squealing in delight! The website shows VERY accurate photos which is unusual for most websites, in fact we thought the photos on the site although amazing still did not do the place justice- it was simply stunning. I must add we stayed in the 3 bedroom villa. We also had a look through the 2 bedroom which is lovely with a very decent pool and one of the biggest beds I have ever seen but the three bedroom is like a mini resort- but the best part IT\"S ALL YOURS!\nSo I was lucky enough to get the master bedroom and it was absolutely massive. By massive I mean huge 4 poster bed with large couch, small couch, flat screen, patio with daybed, a dressing room with his and hers robes-including safe, his and hers vanities an indoor and out door shower and the most romantic deep bath I have ever seen. The other two rooms were very similar just a little smaller and all had freezing air con and attention to detail such us these fabulous reading lights, chocolates on the pillow and lollies in the bathroom! The soap was also to die for and I have stocked up on it for home!\nThe grounds were simply amazing-massive pool 15mx5m quite deep with a bale, the massage pavillion had two massage tables and another very secluded relaxation bale while another gazebo had the third massage table and a lounge/daybed with large coffee table. 6 sun lounges a few extra daybeds plus our own cigar room with sunset deck and dining room with main living room downstairs. Needless to say it was more than enough room for three couples.\nTo top it off a river ran beside it and a quaint door opened up to the fishing huts-just 20 meters to the beach. Quiet beach-no hawkers but good waves. The boys delighted in surfing morning and evening and we loved walking along watching the locals. \nOur first few days we spent visiting The Beach House at Echo Beach for dinner, shopping in Seminyak/Legian and enjoying having people who genuinely wanted to know if we had had a nice day. The girls made the BEST fruit cocktails and we had brought along some vodka to make them even better, while the villa staff had bought us cases of Bintang all of which were served poolside whenever requested.\nAs this is a Villa not a resort there are no food and drinks kept on hand, I knew this before we left so pre ordered lots of fresh fruit, beer, potato chips and our first meal so we were very well prepared. \nI must also add Chef as we called him (never asked his name!) did a brilliant job keeping us full and happy. We even ordered duck spring rolls which were not on the provided menu and they were so good we had them a few times!\nAs first timers to Bali cuisine it was so much fun to try out all of Chefs creations and the girls were just so helpful excited if we liked one of their staple dishes. One night we had a seafood feast-to give you an idea it was $30aud a head and included 3 lobsters, a large fish, crispy duck and at least a dozen of the biggest flame grilled prawns I have ever seen. This was washed down with mixed veg, rice and two amazing sauces. We started with duck spring rolls and all had dessert and this price also included breakfast the next day! While not the cheapest way to eat your way through Bali it was simply amazing and such fresh good quality food we couldn't believe how well priced it was.\nWe also did Babi Guling one night (yes the whole pig (I have the receipt for him!) and invited some friends to join us at the Villa which was all no problem to the wonderful staff- I think we just hit perfection!\nUs girls did an early morning yoga session with a very dedicated instructor-very funny moves, the boys thought it was quite hilarious. One afternoon all six of us had a massage at the same time! I actually had a spa treatment everyday-the Villa organised it through  a local spa-we paid the ladies direct so very reasonable prices and the massage and scrubs were very good.\nWe tried out \"The Living Room\" on the one night we could tear ourselves from the villa. Wow it was a beautiful setting and the food was outstanding, pricey by Bali standards but so well worth it.\nThe Villa also organised a white water rafting trip through Mega Rafting. i had priced round earlier but wanted safety not cheap. We paid a group discount rate of $56us and had seriously one of the best days of our lives with two of the funniest rafting guides you could possibly imagine. Highly recommended. What was not recommended was the amount of steps to be negotiated before and after the rafting!\n\nIn summary the location was perfect-who doesn't love being right on the beach with NO hawkers. I actually couldn't tear myself away from the HUGE pool though.\nRight next to Hotel Tugu and walking distance to The Beach House at Echo Beach.\nBy staying here you are helping out the local community, this place is BALINESE OWNED. The girls you will want to take home-they are gorgeous and just so eager to serve. Made really helped us and was a great host. We are all dreaming of the day we will get back to this paradise.\nThis was one of the NO HANG ON this was the best place I have ever stayed at.\nWe travelled round Bali a bit after our stay here and our standard line became \"It's good but it's no Teresa\".\nPerfect. Do yourself a favour and GO!",

              "text": "We stayed earlier this month in the 3 bedroom villa the front. The place is huge and makes the best of Balinese indoor-outdoor living, with the main dining/living space open on all sides to incredibly lush gardens, a private courtyard and ponds full of tropical fish. Each bedroom is in a separate compound with private terraces indoor/outdoor bathrooms (that are bigger than my entire apartment in Melbourne!) with a private bath and rainwater showers set in the manicured gardens. The Villa is quiet - it is bordered by a small river on one side and has the beach in front (on the other side of a wall). The beach is great for surfing/body-surfing and you won't see any tourists (or hardly any locals) around. It is safe to swim - we didn't encounter any rips - but if you're not game you've got an enormous pool within the villa. We loved the location because it was away from the touristy areas but some may find it too far from Kuta/Jimbaran etc. It is about 20 minutes cab from Seminyak.\nWe found our 10 days incredibly relaxing and the hospitality was unparalled to anywhere else I have stayed in the world. The staff and service is discreet - always around when you need them but out of sight and you don't feel like you're being monitored or bothered. They serve breakfast on your time - whenever you wake up, whether it be at 7am or 11am. The food was brilliant - anything from indonesian dishes to lobster for lunch and they bring the receipts so you can check the cost of everything. It is definitely cheaper than eating out. We are especially going to miss Puspa and her big smile. They clean the rooms and do turndown service very quickly - often we would go for breakfast and come back to a clean room. They can book restaurants etc for you, even fetch immodium from the chemist when one of our friends developed the dreaded bali belly. Nothing is too much trouble. Massages are organised in-villa and they only need 10 minutes notice.\n\nWe checked out the two-bedroom villa - it is about one-quarter the size of the 3 bedroom villa but it has views of the ocean from upstairs and is also beautiful. We want to hire out the entire 5 bedrooms next time.\n\nWe thought that the price, in low season was very reasonable - although at the time we stayed we were helped along by a strong Aussie dollar. It is double the size of the villas we looked at in Seminyak.\n\nThe only problem is, we don't want too many people to know about it!",

Es f\u00e4ngt schon am Flughafen an: Unser Fahrer musste lange - bei str\u00f6menden Regen - warten, bis unser Flugzeug endlich landete. Mit guter Laune hat er uns und unser Gep\u00e4ck trotzdem riesigen Pf\u00fctzen trocken ins Auto gebracht. Um Mitternacht sind wir in der Villa Teresa angekommen. Mit Charme hat man uns das Abendessen serviert. Der Koch, die Angestellten - alle  hatten auf uns gewartet. \n\nAm n\u00e4chsten Morgen konnten wir dann endlich die wundersch\u00f6ne Villa in Augenschein nehmen. Die Homepage der Villa verspricht nicht zu viel. Alles ist wie es auf den Fotos scheint. Das Personal bemerkt man nicht, aber wenn man etwas m\u00f6chte, sind sie jederzeit bereit, alles zu organisieren. \n\nDie Villa ist ca. 10 Strandminuten vom Echo-Beach entfernt. Ideal um dort ein Mittagessen einzunehmen und den Surfern zuzuschauen. Derzeit wird allerdings ein gr\u00f6sserer Hotelkomplex gebaut, es bleibt zu hoffen, dass der sch\u00f6ne Strandabschnitt erhalten bleibt. \n\nZu erw\u00e4hnen bleibt noch, dass wir von dem Spa-Angebot Gebrauch gemacht haben. Das Preis-/Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis ist optimal. Die Masseurinnen kamen vom ausserhalb und wussten was sie taten. In der tollen Umgebung der Villa ein Genuss.",
