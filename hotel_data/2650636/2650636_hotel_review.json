It can be a distressing time falling ill whilst, and I thankyou for acknowledging our staff for their assistance. \r\n\r\nFor our in-villa service menu and mini bar prices we try and remain competitive to the local market and we recommend to anyone to try the BBQ if they get the chance. It is a great way to enjoy the outdoor area of the larger villas or terrace in the 1 Bedroom and celebrate an occasion or just being on holiday.\r\n\r\nThankyou again for your review and we hope to welcome you back at O Villas again soon.",

This Villa was not cheap but was very disappointing compared to the previous reviews & photos. Under no circumstances should it be rated a 4.5 star. I can not fault the wonderful staff who were so obliging and friendly, the Villa itself is in need of an update and a very good clean. Bathrooms & floors were dirty and towels need replacing although laundered, stained and yellow. There were dirty walls and fixtures and gaps and broken parts in most rooms.",

The WiFi was fast and TV screen huge. The location was great..being just minutes from shops, great restaurants like Kultur, Basil and Cartel coffee...the lane leading to the property was quiet and clean. It was peaceful and tranquil to relax by the pool surrounded by well manicured plants and trees while cooling off in the pool. Highly recommended and we can\u2019t wait to return.",

The hygiene is spotty at best, with white towels having several stains, the water in the swimming pool being unclean and the general upkeep of the entire place shoddy.  In our Villa (#2), the airconditioning did not work well and even the ceiling fan wouldn't switch on (despite asking the Management Office to look into it).  The battery in the in-room safe died on us, with our things in it (including my laptop).  Shockingly, the management team did not have a key to open the safe and hence they had to saw it open, damaging my laptop in the process!!!\n\nEven the trees in the courtyard need maintenance, as I had a huge coconut tree branch fall off the tree literally 5 metres from where I was sitting.  If it had hit me, I would have been seriously injured or worse.\n\nThe only redeeming feature of this villa is the staff, who try their best to make the best of your stay.  However, friendly and helpful staff is not a point of difference in a place like Bali, where most places have wonderful people.\n\nTherefore - look elsewhere.",

On arrival we couldn\u2019t believe the space we had (almost a bit too much for 2 couples / 2 small children) and the quality of the rooms and pool. Breakfast was amazing and Yanti and her team even hels and rocked my 4 month old so we could eat quietly and in peace, they were so lovely and accommodating. Tommy, Ketut and all the staff were great with picking us up/ dropping off almost daily (my 3 year old loved then and being allowed in the front!) and were also great with organising tips and things like takeaways for evenings in. We can\u2019t wait to return, thank you all so much for a fabulous stay. ",

So easy when there is a group of you. Especially the bacon and eggs......Also would highly recommend the Chefs BBQ for an evening in! So good! \nThanks again for such a relaxing time at O\u2019Villas, hopefully see you in the not too distant future. \nSare and Alex",

Breakfast is made fresh for you each morning (just order the day before)...the fruit is good quality nice for Bali. And it\u2019s affordable we booked via Hotels.com but all the groups list them. We loved that it\u2019s far enough from eat street and the crowds that you don\u2019t hear the dance music reverberating all night long ..,,yet close enough that you can go misbehave if you want to!!!",

              "text": "We had a fantastic time at O Villas, with 3 of us.  I would definitely stay there again, and there was plenty of room for at least 5 more people.  The living space is huge and offers a full indoor open plan kitchen,  lounge and dining room.  Breakfast was included in our room rate and prepared in our villa every morning at whatever time we chose.  We also ate in for dinner a couple of times and the food was good.  All the staff were extremely friendly and efficient and made our stay like a home away from home.  The on-site driving service was great (complimentary in Seminyak) and let us avoid trying to negotiate with taxi drivers.  We also arranged for a day tour around the island with one of their drivers and he took us to much better sites (less touristy and far less busy) than the previous year I was in Bali and took another tour through a different hotel.  The driver was also a very good driver (as were all the other drivers) and we felt safe at all times. Thoroughly recommended.",

We really appreciated all their hard work and the trouble they went to to make our holiday a special one. The lounge/kitchen part of the villa was large and comfortable - plenty of room for 6 people - with doors we could shut. The bedrooms also big with huge bathrooms. The pool was an excellent size and the whole place was very private. Being away from the main shopping area was a bonus as it was quiet and peaceful and the villa drivers dropped us wherever we wanted to go - all the drivers were excellent and very nice people. The breakfasts were excellent, good variety, staff pleasant and very professional, it was a lovely start to the day. We also ordered from the inhouse menu and from restaurants around Seminak, food consistently good - would highly recommend the Happy Chappy Chinese restaurant -  fantastic meal at reasonable price. We hired one of the villa vans to take us to Ubud - $70 for the whole day, excellent value and a great day trip.  There is a huge variety of spa treatments in Seminak and many places within walking distance of the villa. All in all we felt very spoiled and would return to the villa next time. Thanks Tommy, Katuk, and all the O Villa staff!",

The free breakfast was so delicious - pancakes, eggs benedict, fruit and pastries. The staff were so lovely, personable and it was nice to get an insight into their lives in Indonesia. Thank you so so much O Villas team (special mention to Tommy & Kadak who were the best). We'll be back for sure. ",

              "text": "This is our 5th visit to Bali having stayed in different accommodation around Seminyak  each time. O Villa falls right in the middle as far as expense goes but was the BEST for us in regards to proximity, size and staff. The villa itself was great, 4 large bedrooms with everything you'd expect. The main lounge, dining and kitchen area was large and very comfortable. The addition of a big screen and projector was great for our family. Unlike some villas, the lounge area was enclosed which we find much more enjoyable, it did have big sliding doors if you prefer an open feel. The things we loved most and the reasons we will re book this villa for next year were the location and the staff. The villa is removed enough that it is quiet and relaxed, but is only a short walk into eat street one way and Potato Head, Kudeta the other. It was also a 15 minute (depending on time of day) scooter ride to Batu Balong for a surf and less to Canggu Club featuring Bounce, bowling, kids club and a small water park. The villa provided us with platinum passes to the Canggu Club which gave us free entry to the water park and discounts to all other facilities. The staff were absolutely outstanding, Putu, Bayu and Yanti were  the main people that made sure we were well looked after. Every morning we were greated with a lovely breakfast and friendly smile, nothing was too much trouble Bayu even looked after our boys Angus and Henry for a short time so we could enjoy a nice meal without kids. They were always looking for ways to make our stay easier and more enjoyable.",

              "text": "Stayed in one bedroom villa.  It was large, the aircon worked, so all was well.  Had a reasonably nice time, but do agree with others regarding cleanliness and need to update furnishings.  There were marks around the toilet the first morning till the last. Cleaning didn't seem to be a priority, except for changing the linen every single day, which I found very odd as I have never come across this before.  I would have been quite happy for every 2nd or third day.  Towels were not in good condition, stained and some were torn. \n\nThe staff were lovely and very accommodating, and able to take us wherever we wanted.  I did find it odd that on two occasions we were advised that the computer was offline/broken and could we pay in cash.  Normally not a problem, but on the last day paying $100AUD in cash to stay in the room till close to our boarding time meant a trip to the ATM and being charged fees from the bank in Oz, that was annoying, would have been much easier to pay by credit.  \n\nThe three/four bedroom units had large pools, looked like they were nicely furnished, with one bedroom downstairs, which would be ideal with family with older relatives.\nThere is no reception and no main pool. \n\nThe view from the villa isn't nice, you overlook a large power box and lines.The road to the villa is very narrow and not in good repair.  You do feel a bit isolated, and for that reason I would not stay here again.\n\nIf you don't like stairs, well, it's 20 up/down and the pool is downstairs, which wasn't that good in the heat of the day!!\n\nBreakfast was very good, and one night we ordered room service and again, food was very nice and plentiful.\n\nThank you to the staff, they were all lovely, every single one of them.",

              "text": "We stayed in the 1-bedroom villa for four nights on this trip back to Bali. We must have been spoilt at our previous pool villa which we did not pay that much more for because OVillas fell quite far below what we were expecting.\n\nSadly, the villa we stayed in is in dire need of a good scrubbing of all surfaces, replacement of all soft furnishings (including the day curtains which had huge holes in them and the discoloured towels), discoloured walls, and much more. While it is spacious within the villa with a good-sized living room, bedroom, walk-in wardrobe and huge toilet, the pool is really too small. It took two strokes to get to the other side (length-wise) and every morning, we'd see leaves and white particles (from the surrounding vegetation) floating in the pool. \n\nOne day the television did not work, and another morning there was no water. Our breakfast box we ordered for 6:15 am (we were told this would not be a bother at all) arrived at 6:55 am. We were given a lovely bowl of complimentary fruit, but no knives or plates were available to cut them. On the night we wanted to drink our beer, we found there was no bottle opener. While we could have asked the staff to cut fruit for us or deliver a bottle opener to us, we were also wondering if these should not be basic amenities the room should provide? As we brushed aside these inconvenience, we did feel a a little more than let down. \n\nOVillas is located quite far in from the main road. We are pretty self-sufficient people and walked in and out to the beach and other parts of Seminyak without using the in-house transport. It was not difficult to find food and mini-marts less than 100 m out, although I'd highly recommend having a torchlight handy if you're walking back after dinner. \n\nAs mentioned in previous reviews, the staff are the redeeming factor here. We came home to a turned-down bed and air-con turned on every night (except the last night), and the staff were eager to find out our daily plans to see how they could assist us. So thank you to Putu, Ketut and Bayu for being so attentive and accommodating.",

This Villa is quite remote with very few cafes, restaurants and bars nearby you would need to walk a kilometre to find but Road is narrow and busy. O Villas market themselves as luxury Villas but our 1 bedroom apartment with tiny pool we thought was far from luxurious. It looks quite dirty and tired from outside and needs a coat of paint and gerni to remove mould and dirt. Inside is ok I wouldn't call it a 1 bedroom just glass wall and door separating bedroom from lounge room. Kitchenette no not really sorry no oven or hot plates inside or even a sink these are outside which is quite inconvenient on hot nights with mozzies. Staff are fantastic and make the place and free shuttle around town is great we just prefer the freedom to walk to dinner and drinks. ",

The kitchen and lounge is huge!!! The mini bar, which is a large stainless steel fridge was great, the beers, soft drink etc was cheaper to buy than anywhere you could get it...... A big pool that is well maintained, a outdoor shower and toilet which is convenient after swimming..... Like I said, it's hard to leave...... The most outstanding point of this Villa is the customer service and staff.... They add a real person touch, helping us with everything and anything we needed... The breakfast each morning was my favourite time of the day, the food was magnificent! The breakfast crew catered for everything we needed.. Even organised Vegemite for me! They were so polite and courteous and were happy to answer any questions I had about Bali and their culture..... They weren't just the staff, I become really good friends with them... The customer service was world class!   I would recommend O Villas Seminyak to anyone, particularly to family's... Its located in a quiet section in Seminyak and it's so peaceful...... If you want a great holiday stay here, you won't regret it..... Thank you to everyone at O Villas Seminyak!! I can't wait to come back! Amazing!!      Tim \ud83d\udc4d",

A huge THANK YOU must go out to all the staff at O Villas, all our needs were met above and beyond our expectations, smiling, friendly staff that would do anything to make your stay enjoyable, from cooking our breakfast in our villa every morning, (the breakfasts were delicious!!) to taking us anywhere we needed to go during the day or night- we were simply amazed! \nWe will definitely be booking there again next time we visit Bali without a second thought. Again another Thank you to the amazing staff, you made our holiday, and so glad to make some new friends along the way! ",

The pool the bedrooms the lounge and dinning areas were spotless and the pool so relaxing. The complementary taxi was a very nice touch. They also made a cake and decoarated the dinning area for Ronans birthday. Well done to all the fantastic staff. We will return from England and our daughter will return from Australia.

Once we arrived at the villa at 10pm, they provided us with a minty beverage which was unexpected to say hello. Our butler also gave us a tour of the whole villa. The size of the villa, bedrooms and pool were larger than anticipated as well! They also provide free transportation around Seminyak which also came in handy for us and saved us plenty of money. \n\nEvery morning the staff would cook us breakfast at our preferred time and of our choice from a selected menu, which consisted of both Indonesian and European cuisine. This also included a wide range of seasonal fruits and pastries with a selection of spreads.\n\nThe villa would be cleaned every morning whilst we were out so that there was no interruption during our stay. They also provided service at all times when necessary of a phone call away - helping out with the projector to watch movies and so much more. \n\nFree wifi was given, a private pool, beach towels, poolside beds and gazebo, full equipped kitchen with cutlery, crockery and glassware. Tea, coffee and filtered water was also provided on a daily basis for free. The fridge was filled with drinks that are charged a lot cheaper than purchasing it outside of the villa - including Bintangs!!! \n\nThe staff are extremely friendly, welcoming, easy to joke around with and helpful! They know how to look after you and are the true meaning of hospitality! \n\nSpecial thanks to Bayu, Tommy, Kadek, Chef Kadek, Yanti and Agus!!! You were the cherry on top of our holiday in Bali! Thank you so much! Lots of love from the Teoh Family from New Zealand! \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddff ",

They were even able to provide a pool fence at the very lasy minute.\nNo request was ever too much trouble for the staff...   The service of the staff was absolutely impeccable and they always went above and beyond for us as a family. Yanti even helped feed my babies breakfast!! \ud83d\ude0a\nThank you so much for making our stay so memorable and so easy whilst travelling with little children! We cannot wait to come back next year. ",

The staff are extremely friendly and helpful - happy to organise whatever you may need or want to do. A local driver service is included to drop you off and pick you up as you need. We loved the cooked breakfast each morning and if you wish to stay in at night, the room service options are great and well priced. We had the in Villa BBQ one night which was fantastic - the home made sauces were superb. I highly recommend O Villas for a great Bali getaway.",

The shuttle service is readily available to drop and collect you from wherever you want to go. The villa itself was spacious, comfortable and very relaxing - we also had a private pool. We can't recommend this villa highly enough and the staff were amazing.",

              "text": "I can't say enough about our experience at O Villas. We were a group of 12, so had two villas next to each other. The villas themselves are beautiful, with huge rooms and the most comfortable beds ever. The pool area is perfect for lazy days of tanning and relaxing. Even better, though, was the service. Bayu, Tommy, Ketut, and the rest of the staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating. No request was too large, and the complimentary taxi rides were so helpful. Breakfast is included as well, and it was lovely to have the staff prepare it in the villas every morning. It's not on the menu, but ask for the strawberry pancakes! Delicious! As for location, it was perfect for walking into Seminyak. About 10-15 minutes in either direction will get you to eat street or Seminyak Square. I would absolutely stay here on my next group trip to Bali!",

Shuttle service was brilliant - always available, and very flexible.  Cleanliness maybe not quite up to standard, but otherwise terrific place, and I would thoroughly recommend it.",

Ketut and his team go over and above with their level of service and and friendliness. Having a car service at your disposal (especially transporting all 10 of us at any one time) was an added bonus. The staff coming in each day to cook a delicious breakfast and then clean it all away was a sheer luxury, as were the massages by the pool!  Would also recommend the BBQ dinner that is available to have cooked at your villa. \nI particularly want to praise Lisa who handled all our booking requirements so promptly and with such understanding of our situation. \nFor a great Bali experience, stay at OVillas.",

The amenities are fabulous and the staff were considerate, kind and helpful. They made you feel like you were part of their family! The location is a little way off the main shopping strips but the staff are very happy to drop you anywhere in the Seminyak area - for free. Special thanks to Ketut, Yanti, Tomy, Bayu and Kedak. Angus, Lola & Ruby NEVER want to stay anywhere else in Bali! Suksama and sampi jumpa!",

They are very well appointed with toiletries, kitchen supplies etc. the private pool is quite large and the surrounds are lovely. The most outstanding thing about these villas are the staff and their fantastic attitudes, good cooking skills and their attentiveness. \nThe down side for me is the distance to eat st. but this is rectified by a complimentary driving service. Overall very good accommodation. ",

The staff drove us everywhere we needed to go and picked us up. \nFrom shops, resturants etc. Breakfast served in villa by private chef, anything from sausages and egg to crepes with strawberries. The villa itself was superclean and towels changed daily and cleaned rooms. We were 8 adults and had 4 bedrooms with all private ensuite and king sized beds. If you are a large group, THIS IS YOUR VILLA!! The staff are amazing! Makes you want to recommend to everyone so noone misses out on the service ovilla provides! Do it, book it!",

It was hot hot hot however as soon as we hopped in the car we were given fresh cold bottles of water - soooooo good!\nThe villa itself was lovely and clean. The beds were enormous. As it is a 4 bedroom villa we had to choose which 3 bedrooms we wanted. We chose the 1 downstairs and 2 of the 3 upstairs which we advised the lady after she'd shown us around. We were a little disappointed that the 3rd room we chose was locked with the air con off when we arrived after looking around that arvo. As a result, they had to come and open it however it was like a hot box so my hubby and 3 year old had to sleep downstairs. \n*Beware families with small children: we had a pool fence around the pool however my 3 year old still got in the pool and almost drowned. Also, the steps to the upstairs bedrooms are quite steep for little ones (as well as older ppl).\nBayu, kadek, wayno (Wayne), tommy two gloves and ketut were great - would take us places whenever we wanted and get us take away from whichever restaurant we wanted (when we simply just wanted to stay in!)\nThe villa had a full kitchen so you could cook yourself if you wanted.\nThe breakfast was cooked in our villa and was lovely.\nThe bathrooms were a little tired & the location was about 10mins walk (in extreme humidity!) from the heart of where you want to be in seminyak. \nAll in all a nice place to stay however needs a little updating.",

It sounds like the cold refreshments on arrival where needed, March can be a very hot and humid time to visit being right at the end of the rainy season. It was disappointing to hear that not all rooms had the air-conditioning on for your arrival, this is our normal check-in procedure and we have noted this to be addressed and apologise for the inconvenience on your first night. It was quite a surprise to also read your comments in regards to the pool fencing, it must of been quite a scare. With the temporary fencing it is installed only at clients request as it is not a safety requirement in Bali. All of our villas are for private use and we do please ask that children are fully supervised around the water at all times, our staff can also assist if and when required. \n\nWe really appreciate your comments on the staff and how they looked after you during your stay. You have made some valid comments on the layout configuration of the villas and for anyone wanting to review you can find detailed floor plans of each of our villas on our website.  We hope that you and your family will come back and visit Bali again soon.\n\n",

The staff were just so beautiful! They catered to everything we asked!! The price includes lifts to and from seminyak anytime, although its a tiny tiny walk with lots to see on the way! You can walk to the beach from here to! So fabulous location! \nIt was just a wonderful holiday and would highly highly recommend these villas to anyone wanting to stay in seminyak! Breakfast is huge!! and delicious!!\n\nThe owners of this villa should really appreciate the staff there, as the staff really made our stay!\n\nTHANKYOU KUTUT :)",

The staff were nothing short of wonderful and a highlight of our stay. They drove us wherever we wanted to go and organised a birthday party, last minute laundry and special transport to a wedding. Nothing was too much trouble and there was always a smile or a joke. I would highly recommend O Villas",

It was like our own little resort with a great lounge, dining and kitchen space to get together, hang out and eat as a group. The pool was a good size and received a mix of sun and shade throughout the day, there were sun lounges and a day bed poolside hut.\nThe villa offers free airport pick up and drop off which was seamless and also free transport around Seminyak from the villa. This is great as the location of the villa is a bit out of the way, but by car you are surrounded by restaurants, shops and spas within 5 minutes. The staff at the villa and our butlers were fantastic, so friendly and helpful - nothing was too much trouble. We arranged a BBQ at the villa for my sister's birthday, the food was great and we didn't have to do a thing. The staff shopped cooked and cleaned up, they even entertained and held the baby while we were eating! That day while we were out they decorated the dining room with balloons, streamers and a happy birthday banner! We were so impressed and thank the team for making my sister's birthday so special!\nThe villa was very clean, the wifi great throughout the villa. Overall the villa set up was great and the staff made our stay thoroughly enjoyable!",

The minibar is the same price as the mini mart. \nThe villa itself was pretty big, came with tv, fast internet and a DVD. \nPrivate pool was nice.

              "text": "We had 2 of the 4 bedroom villas for family and friends for a week, and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. From the moment we were picked up at the airport until we were dropped back a week later nothing was a bother to the staff.\n\nThey served breakfast when we wanted it, drove us everywhere and then picked us up, day and night, the service was great. The villas have a fridge stocked with drinks at prices relatively equal to the local minimart so no need to even go out for drinks. There is also an in house menu and custom meals option, which we didn't use much because of the vast array of great restaurants nearby, but what was ordered was very good and reasonably priced.\n\nThey also do laundry at a very cheap rate so everything is covered.\n\nMy daughter had a birthday while we were there and the staff decorated the villa and came in singing happy birthday with a cake !! A very nice touch.\n\nThe 4 bedroom villas have beautiful large pools and even a toilet and shower next to the pool. All bedrooms are large with ensuites making the villas ideal for even 4 couples. The rooms are separate and private, the only minor negative being you go outside to get to the rooms upstairs, rather than just moving around inside. This wasn't an issue to us, with adult children but might be to others with small children.\n\nAfter the really good reviews prior to going, we went with high expectations and it's fair to say our expectations were exceeded. Everyone from Lisa who did the bookings and changes we made so efficiently to to whole team in Seminyak were great, and made our holiday a delight. Nothing was a bother, even when our plane home was cancelled, the manager was available to personally drive us to the airport to sort it out at a moments notice. \n\nIf you are looking for somewhere to relax and enjoy your holiday in Bali this is it.",

We had 4 large bedrooms all with their own big bathrooms. The kitchen / living area was fantastic and even provided a projector screen with a choice of different movies. The pool was large and suited us really well. \n\nWe were traveling with three young children so we pre-organised to have pool fencing installed for our stay for approx 30USD a day. When traveling with young children you do need to be careful as the stairs are quiet steep. \n\nBreakfast was served fresh to order every morning. Although the portions were a little small for us, they provided extra food for us as requested. \n\nThe location of the villas isn't the best but we didnt have any issues with it, as the complimentary shuttle service to Seminyak Square was always available when requested. \n\nThe butler service was great! Rooms were cleaned daily and room service was quick and easy. Couldn't have asked for better service.",

We took three rooms in a four bedroom villas. The roooms are spacious with excellent air conditioning. The bathrooms huge with all amenities. The private pool was perfect at just the right temperature and non chlorinated water. The staff is unobtrusive but readily available. Also the chauffeur driven car for local transit is a boon.

The Villa manager Ketut, your private butler and all the staff do everything they can to make your stay as relaxed and enjoyable as possible.\n\nThe little extras make all the difference and you can see their eye to detail with stocked fridge (at shop prices), full amenities and free high speed wifi.\n\nThe Chef does a great job with a full cooked breakfast each day and they have a full 'villa' service menu available.  Should you want anything specific they will go shop for the ingredients and cook for you rather than going out every night all at cost price plus a small mark up.\n\nThe vehicle isn't just for airport transfer and was available for any local journeys to markets or restaurants.  They were just a call away from coming to collect you as well. \n\nI have been to Bali a number of times and for sure I will return to O Villas.\n\nThanks Guys",

However this was never a problem as there was a driver to drop you locally. \n\nThe breakfasts were amazing and you could select what you wanted.   \n\nFantastic having own private pool to swim in several times a day. \n\nLocation is very secure, quiet and peaceful. \n\nWe will definitely return on our next trip to Bali! \n",

The pool is super clean and always sparkling! \n\nBut it was the staff that made the trip so special for me. Warm, welcoming and friendly. No request was to difficult and always met with a smile. These are some very special people. Kudos to the owner for hiring such a great team! The manager - Ketut - was truly one of the most wonderful people I have ever met. He felt like family by the time we left! And the driver, by the name of Wayan, was an absolute gentleman and incredibly kind. When my son got sick he drove us to the hospital with such precise and impressive driving - we got there quicker and more safely than we would have in a taxi! \n\nI could write a chapter on each of the staff and how lovely they are. But you get the picture. \n\nI will definitely be going back to O Villa again. ",

There are really big bedrooms with bathrooms. Good wi-fi and different services (you can rent a bike or order a wonderful barbecue just on place). And a lot of different things that we just asked we got it in five minutes.\nAnd of course I want to tell a big THANK YOU our staff team, all of them are very friendly, helpful and funny.

The large villas are very spacious and are suitable and comfortable for large groups and families travelling together.

The staff there were incredibly attentive, from the airport pick up - to being served breakfast daily in the Villa at any time we chose! They couldn't do enough for us, and special thanks to Mr Ketut, who was excellent, and had lots of great local tips as well. The Villas are very plush with every comfort on offer, big comfortable bedrooms, huge bathrooms and loads of living space indoors with plenty of outdoor space by the pool! It's only a short walk into Seminyak with all the fab restaurants & bars, but in a quiet local area. If you fancy - the staff will drive you anywhere locally, all included! Highly recommend staying at The O Villas!",

There were about 30 of us who essentially took over the villas & we were completely spoilt by the friendly & attentive staff, the facilities & the location. This is a real gem tucked away close to the centre of Seminyak & I look forward to going back & having more time to explore with O Villas as the base for the next adventure.",

Whilst we were not on the beach it did not matter as it was so peaceful and quiet.\nThe rooms were very clean and the bed comfortable. We had some issues with cold water and the shower head which were fixed very promptly.\nA beautiful breakfast with choice of Indonesian or Western food was cooked for us every morning.\nWhenever any of us wanted to go somewhere all we had to do was call and a car would be there. To go to the wedding some of us had the fortune to go in an old Volkswagon jeep style open vehicle which was much fun.\nOne of our party had their birthday while we there and the kitchen was decorated and a beautiful cake was presented.\nThank you Kadek and all the staff we had a fantastic time and will recommend O Villas!!",

From the moment we booked until the moment we left the service couldn't have been better. \nDon't let the little road leading up to the villas put you off. What awaits you won't disappoint.\nWe stayed in the one bedroom villa. So much space for 2 people. Perfectly appointed and the huge balcony terrace on which breakfast was served daily was amazing. If we were to be very picky, the pool was on the small side but served it's purpose on a hot day.\nThe staff were amazing. They did as much or as little as we needed them to do. Always ready to help you or drive you wherever you needed to go.\nOne of the highlights was being driven to dinner in the 1973 jeep. \nJust don't wear a short skirt ladies!\nWe would go back in a heart beat. Had a look at a 4 bedroom villa and are thinking about revisiting with friends.",

The area is continually being developed with new local restaurants and our little road down to the villas is starting to see more life. We are pleased to hear you enjoyed the ride in the 1973 Jeep, our staff enjoy every opportunity to take it out for a spin. \r\nThe 1 bedroom apartment you stayed is well appointed for a couple retreat and we would welcome the opportunity on your next visit to experience our much larger 4 Bedroom villas, which has a large outdoor pool and entertaining area suitable for a stay with family or friends. The larger villas can also be booked as 2 or 3 bedroom to suit the number of guests.\r\nWe really appreciate your review on O Villas, thankyou and we hope to see you in Bali again soon.",

From the moment we were met at the airport with cold face towels and cold water we realised that we had made he right decision.\nTravelling with two little kids can be difficult however everyone at O Villas treated our kids like their favourite niece and nephew. They enjoyed all the extra attention they got and loved feeding the fish - not only in our villa but also villa 3. Curious by nature my children wanted to explore and every time we stepped out of the villa there was someone wanting to help and play. From magic tricks to rides on bikes.\nIt is the people who make this villa the most memorable however the villa and pool area are also worth a comment. The rooms are huge modern and clean the outdoor area the largest we have seen in a villa. The beds were comfy and wifi exceptional!! \nWe just couldn't fault this place and appreciate the extra effort they went to for us especially my husbands birthday party which was celebrated with cake and lots of decorations!!!!",

Please read my previous review  in April 2014.\n\nFor the most part the staff are the same, Richard and Kadek have moved on, but Yanti is still there and is ably supported by Bayu and Not forgetting Ketut. During our stay was Silence Day which in itself is an interesting experience, but, Bayu took very good care of us and we had a lovely dinner, picked from the in house dining menu.\n\nO Villas staff work as a team, everyone plays their part as nobody would dream of letting the team down. Sure from time to time language barriers can create some confusion, but, very few of the Balinese I have dealt with will ask you to explain what you want, so you can benefit from clarifying your requests.\n\nWill I stay at O Villas again? The answer is a definite yes; it's a great place to stay, staffed by terrific people. Thank you O Villas for a great holiday.",

It was like staying in a five star hotel with the space and comfort of an amazing villa. \n The staff were fantastic, there when you need them but leaving one feeling pampered. We stayed in one night and had a three course meal prepared by the Villas chef, the meat was one of the best steaks I've had I a long time, satays and salads just rounded a perfect meal. ( and the cost was cheaper than eating out). The fridge was always restocked and beer was kept cold in an esky loaded with ice. \nBreakfast was on time every day, made in our own kitchen, best part, no dishes.    \nSlept like a baby on a very comfortable bed, and a great pillow choice, after watching the Bali DVD on a massive pull down projection screen..\nThe staff took us everywhere we wished to go at a moments notice, and picked us up..but alas they took us to the airport, but we all promised to return, soon.

Very convienent having complimentary breakfast served to us each morning in our villa. \nEvery room in the villa is 5 star quality. The location is quiet and only a few minutes from Seminyak square which the staff were more than willing to drop us there and back. \nCan't wait to come back and stay.

Well thanks to fellow TripAdvisor friends and their reviews, we made a choice to stay at O Villas. That was the best decision we took.\nMy wife was just speechless about the serenity around the villa. We stayed at the lone one-bedroom villa with private pool, and it was just like home away from home. To begin with, the pool is on the ground floor, where as the room is on the first floor. Not a deterrent but this somewhat made me feel we ended up under using the pool. But the time we used the pool, there was nothing we could complain about. Yes, it was on the lower floor and we had to take the stairs every time, but hey, when the whole villa is for us to enjoy, and secured by a door, what more to worry?\n\nThe service just keeps getting better by the day, as they get to know your taste of food. The butler service was just what we needed to pamper us to the core. They were courteous enough to wait for us to serve food, however long we made them wait. The quality of food served was amazing.\n\nThe villa was made up every time we came back home. This was a real challenge for the staff, given that we had literally made the place a mess with pillows and food littered all around. The bedroom was neat and had a very comfortable bed. The only complaint  though is that, the air-conditioning in the bedroom could have been better or the AC more strategically placed.\n\nEvery time we had to go out, be it on a sight seeing, or drop us off somewhere and pick us back, the vehicles were ready for us, well kept and cooled. We just had to hop on.\n\nIn all, if we were to visit Bali again, there is no way we can stay at a place other than O Villas.",

Nothing was too much trouble for the very polite, helpful and gracious staff.  The food was delicious.  We enjoyed beautiful breakfasts and a wonderful barbecue.  The amazing butlers were very efficient in taking care of reservations at restaurants and spas and making sure our visit ran very smoothly.  The drivers chauffeured us around safely,  were always on time and very polite opening doors and carrying baggage.  We were always greeted with smiles and made to feel so welcome by all the staff every time we returned to the villas.  The cleaning staff made sure our rooms were nicely cleaned every day and plenty of fresh water available in bathrooms.  We loved the big beds and large bathrooms also the outdoor bathroom.  The private pool in its ambient setting was delightful.  Thanks to each and every one of the gracious staff who made our holiday so memorable.",

This was our 3rd time in Bali in 5 years, always stayed in beach front resorts but this time travelling with a 7, 5 & 2 y.o. we opted to give a villa a go.  We will definitely be doing the villa option again thanks to our experience at the O Villas, thanks in a big part to their staff. \nStaff - every single member of the team could not do enough for us.  They are awesome and were excellent with our kids.  The on site babysitting option is very good.  The overall service is excellent.\nLocation - only short walk to shops, but with the 2 best drivers in Bali, who needs to walk.  We were picked up and dropped off where ever we wanted to go.  Beats taxis and walking. \nFacilities - the place is not brand new but is extremely well kept and very clean.  Shower pressure was not perfect but it was still good and WiFi was perfect.  Kids loved the projector and we watched the footy finals live in our living room.\nA nice surprise was the membership at the Canggu Club - we went there 4 times, mum and dad used the gym, relaxed by the pool and drank cocktails and kids played all day at the brand new water park, plus there heaps more things to do a the club.

The Canggu Club has been undergoing a transformation and with the new 'Splash' waterpark and 'Bounce' now open there is plenty of fun for the whole family. Since your stay we have changed the water tanks for the top level bedrooms to have their own water source which has significantly improved the water pressure in these bathrooms. \r\n\r\nThankyou for your kind comments on our villa staff and drivers we really enjoy hearing how we contributed to your holiday experience. We hope to see you and your family back at O Villas again soon.",

              "text": "My fianc\u00e9e and I stayed at O Villas for four nights (taking advantage of their \u2018free nights special\u2019 \u2013 excellent value) and just had the most wonderful time. \n\nArriving late at the airport, it was such a welcome sight to see our driver waiting for us to whisk us off to our villa. He came prepared with cold water and cold face towels, perfect after a six hour flight! \n\nO Villas isn\u2019t too far from the airport (maybe half an hour?) so excellent first destination if you plan on travelling around Indonesia. \n\nWhen we arrived, we were greeted by the head butler Ketut who showed us into the one-bedroom villa, which was just AMAZING. \n\nFirstly \u2013 it\u2019s massive. We couldn\u2019t believe we had so much space all to ourselves! \nYou have a smallish private pool when you first walk in with two lounges, then up some stairs to the enormous balcony (where breakfast is delivered every morning) which also has some lounges and a day bed. \n\nMoving inside you have a living room area with fully-stocked mini-bar fridge, TV, couches etc. and then onto the bedroom. \n\nSUCH a comfortable bed!!! Four poster with mosquito netting (though we didn't see a single mosquito while we were there) and just lovely and so comfy. In fact, sleep quality at O Villas is second to none. \n\nLeading off from the bedroom is a walk-in wardrobe type space (perfect to dump luggage) and then the bathroom, which was excellent - no bath but two showers! \n\nBut what really makes O Villas stand out is the service. \n\nOur butlers were just so lovely and would do anything and everything to make sure you have a perfect stay. When they discovered I was a fan of gin & tonics, the fridge all of a sudden was stocked with as much tonic water, ice and lime a girl could wish for! Likewise with my fianc\u00e9e and his fondness for Bintangs \u2013 the staff (without being asked) brought an esky filled with ice and beer for him. Amazing!\n\nAfter Seminyak we were headed to Gili T and Ketut managed to organise a return transfer at (literally) half the original price. Lesson here: if you want something done, ask Ketut! \n\nAs the other reviews have detailed here, O Villas isn\u2019t in the thick of Seminyak but there are two cars each with a driver which will take you and pick you up from anywhere you wish to go. It was super easy to get around and we never had ANY trouble booking the cars. (And even if you did, it is about a $1 cab ride into town.) \n\nOne thing I will note is that the staff will let themselves into your villa unannounced so just be aware \u2013 even though you have your own villa, you aren\u2019t as \u2018private\u2019 as you may imagine. So those keen on naked sunbathing, you have been warned! \n\nAll in all, a fantastic stay. We will be back!!",

This is our 8th time to Bali so we have had a few trial & errors with accommodation over the years! From the moment we arrived we were looked after like royalty. Every need was catered for in such a professional but friendly manner. Staff were always on hand to attend to your needs but also gave you space and privacy when required. We stayed in a 4 bed villa which was exceptionally clean and of course serviced every day. It was like we were staying in our own holiday house as there was everything you could need cook, entertain and relax - not that we did any cooking!! The breakfast the staff cooked every morning was fresh & delicious and the kids also enjoyed ordering off the room service menu while laying around the pool. Transport from Kadek was fun, he is a wonderful driver and great to talk to. Prices for Kadek to drive all day were very reasonable and nothing was ever too much trouble. The best thing about o'villas was definitely the staff, each and every one of them and their beautiful big smiles made our stay so happy and enjoyable.",

              "text": "Stayed for a week in Villa 3, had a great time there. The premise is huge, we had 8 people and did not feel crowded at all. The pool was nice and the big living room with the large screen TV was really good to hang out in. The hotel staff is very friendly and accommodating. We hired a van and a driver from the villa for 5 days. On most days, we spent more than 10 hours, and they did not charge extra for the time (the daily rate includes 10 hours). I also asked for a special breakfast (an eight egg white and two whole egg omelet) and they accommodate that request as well. The driver also took us to Carrefour to do some shopping for our beach picnic. They even let us stay till 4pm on the check-out date for free because we have a late flight out of Bali. Overall, awesome experience. The only caveat is the low water pressure and the poor wifi coverage (the staff said they are in the process of replacing their router). Would definitely come back if I'm going to stay in Seminyak again.",

Our room was massive, with a huge walk in shower and a bath. And very, very clean.\nI loved the pool, a good size if you want to wake up with a few laps in the morning, and very private.\nAll the staff were fantastic, from making our breakfast in the morning, I recommend the omelettes, to driving us to the markets or taking us to a restaurant at night. \nThe living area was great, plenty of space to relax out of the sun and enjoy a beer, while watching a film on the BIG screen, they have a projector that pulls down from the ceiling. Very cool. \nOverall, I felt this was the perfect base for our trip to bali, so many great restaurants and bars with live music close by, we loved Frankensteins and Zappas, and also really easy to get to Ubud or Kuta. \nWe were really spoiled here and can't wait to go back!",

We arrived at the airport with the driver from the villa to collect us with a cold towel and a bintang beer. The staff at the accommodation were so helpful and would do anything for you. The villas were immaculate and very well looked after. They were absolutely stunning.  It was like having a little family looking after you.  The pool was excellent too just being able to get up in the morning and go for a swim was great.  \n\nYou could book the driver if you wished and we were able to experience bali with the experience of a local who was able to give you information that you would never had known. We booked the driver for the day and went to the safari park and ubud to the monkey forest. Well worth a visit.  \n\nWe could not fault this villa and will certainly be returning.  A fantastic accommodation.",

              "text": "We have just returned from an 11 night holiday at O'Villa's along with my brother and his family from the UK. For us coming from Perth it was our 5th visit to Bali and I can honestly say that it was the best holiday we have had on the island so far and for my brother and his family it was the perfect place to stay for his first visit. I arranged the holiday and when I booked I was looking for something that would make him want to come to back and staying at O'Villa's has certainly done that. It is the perfect place to stay and spend quality time with family. \n\nWe stayed in one of the four bed villa's which was absolutely immaculate in terms of cleanliness and also d\u00e9cor, it is visually stunning, very comfortable and has been designed in such a way that it is impossible not to relax and have a wonderful time.\n\nAs others have said the airport transfers were great with cold towels and cold drinks provided on pick up however it was on our arrival at the villa where we were greeted with nice tunes playing on the quality sound system, more cold towels and a delicious ice tea for all that we knew we had hit the jackpot. \n\nThe staff attended to our every need in a very professional manner and always with smiles on their faces. The housekeeping was excellent as were the breakfasts, room service and dinners in the evening. The quality of the O'Villa meals were up there with some of the best restaurants we ate in and at a reasonable price too. The mini-bar and room service prices were also very affordable compared to some resorts I have stayed in and the room service food was of a high standard. \n\nThe other facilities in the Villa were awesome, the pool was a delight for all and the projector screen was enjoyed by our younger kids to watch movies at night whilst the adults relaxed outside in the ambient night time atmosphere. The living area was beautifully furnished and comfortable for all eight of us to relax in on the odd occasion we were not in the pool area. We were all very impressed with the transport service and we had no problems organizing our lifts to and from Seminyak and the beach. We also used the villa drivers to go to Kuta on two occasions and for a day tour which whilst at an additional cost was no more than other transport would have been and was more convenient.\n\nI must also add that the staff, whilst very professional, were also great with the kids.\n\nTo sum up the whole experience was outstanding and we would not hesitate to book O'Villa's again.\n\nParticular thanks to Ketut, Yanti, Kadek, Agus, Bayu and the chefs.\n\nSampai jumpa lagi!",

The rooms were all one would want with television, stereo, IPod docking station as well as adequate WIFI. Bedroom, kitchen and bathroom were spotless.    \n\nI do not think I have ever had service as good as this ever. (Thanks). \n\nIf we ever decide to return to Bali this accommodation will be our first pick.\n\nWe went to the local market and area for dinner and had the best time. \n\nThanks to the helpful staff for going out of their way to help us get to the airport on time. All of you were great.",

              "text": "We decided on O Villas for our annual girl's trip to Bali after hours of research, and we couldn't have chosen a better place!  We were blown away by the level of service - pickup at the airport, meet and greet at the villa with an explanation of all the facilities, butler service by the lovely Kadek and drop off and pickup around Seminyak.  When we first booked with Lisa (who happened to be in Perth), all our requests were sorted efficiently i.e. twin beds (really only suitable for children; we ended up sharing the massive main bed), (very) late checkout for NO CHARGE!  We took advantage of the early bird booking - 7 nights for the price of 5 which turned out to be terrific value.  The villa is a little bit further out than some villas, however, the drop off and pickup service made up for this, and taxi drivers would always (eventually) agree to 20,000 RUP (AUD $2.00) from Seminyak Central, so very cheap.  I walked into Seminyak Square once and it took around 25 minutes, so only a few minutes by car.  The facilities at O Villas are fabulous, and we especially enjoyed the air conditioned kitchen / lounge area, the lovely pool area as well as the blender for making our cocktails.  We were very reluctant to order a meal through the villa after a bad experience at another villa last year, but we decided to try it.  It was one of our nicest meals - we each paid AUD $15 and the staff did the shopping and cooking whilst we lounged by the pool.  It was then served up and they even made us up some iced tea.  Spectacular service!  We really couldn't fault a thing at O Villas, and are currently making plans to come back and stay next year.  I really don't think we could find a better place and such great value.  Thank you to all the staff - Security, Cooks, Butlers, Drivers - you do a fabulous job and we really appreciated all you did for us!",

Just minutes from Seminyaks main 'Eat Street' - Jl. Oberoi, O Villas is tucked away down its own private driveway, away from the noise and bustle of town. We started our trip with a transfer at the airport, picked up by the Ovilla staff, greeted with a bintang & a cold towel on arrival! Luv It! They then transferred us down to our beautiful villa - number 3, with a huge pool, lounge and kitchen - with a projector screen (which i was wrapped about...). Over the next few days, we really didn't do much except laze by the pool! The staff were amazing, catered to our every need, and even cooked us dinner - and Ill tell ya something - one of the best Nasi Goreng's I've ever had. Oh, and the beds are amazing - I even asked if I could take one home!!! Out of all the places ive stayed in Seminyak over the years, the attention to detail, the staff, the surroundings are all fantastic - so worth a look. Thank you very much to every one at O Villa for looking after us! Its was an absolute delight!",

Starting from a pickup from the busy Denpasar airport, the team made sure our trip was effortless! They helped communicate with some tour operators and accommodated early breakfast boxes when we had an early departure one morning. Speaking of breakfast, every item on the O Villas breakfast menu was delicious, fresh, and well-presented. Accompanied by coffee, toast, and fresh fruit, every day had an amazing start! \n\nLocated in a quiet street in Seminyak, O Villas is situated in a great area. A short walk to amazing restaurants, spas, and the main shopping street, the villas feel like an island oasis despite being close to the hustle of Seminyak. The staff were also very accommodating and dropped us off/picked us up in the villa van around Seminyak at no additional cost! \n\nThe villa itself is well maintained, clean, and comfortable. The pool is always clean and towels are refreshed daily as well. My friend and I enjoyed the large beds, and as two female travellers, felt safe knowing that the O Villas staff were always on duty and keeping an eye on the villas! \n\nThank you again to Ketut, Tommy, and the rest of the O Villa team! I'm already planning my next stay!!",

The breakfast was fantastic each day and the fridge always stocked with cold drinks.  We used the vehicle a fair bit for trips out - not only great value but also super safe with reliable drivers.  A little corner of paradise and look forward to returning.",

Although the staff are happy to drive you around the local area. \nThe staff serve an excellent breakfast of your choice and if required, you can order lunch or dinner, which we have done several times. \nThe bedrooms are so spacious and have everything you need with lovely decor. \nCan\u2019t wait be back there! \n",

The home cooked local food is very high quality and I particularly enjoyed the breakfasts. There are also some fantastic local restaurants a few minutes walk away which have happy hours and provide local cuisine. This is a place where you will return again and again. What a find!",

The first thing to say it was an amazing experience. The staff are very helpful and will pretty much do anything to make sure you are happy . From booking trips to arranging transport to making breakfast I don\u2019t want to single out anyone as they were are great . The location was spot on just a short walk to some lovely bars and restaurants or if needed you can get a lift into town . The villas themselves are just as advertised. Lots of room , great pool , excellent showers and with air con which was needed . Will hopefully return within the next couple of years and look forward to seeing all the team again then .",

I spent my 50th birthday there and we ordered the BBQ which I highly recomend. The lovely staff even decorated  while I was out before they cooked the magnificent BBQ. 10/10",

Our complete satisfaction was primarily due to the care and attention delivered each and every day by the O Villa Team. The Manager Katut was professional, quickly addressed our concerns graciously, advised us and was always available. We will miss the cheerful and eager staff members, Agust, Tommy, Wayan, security, chef, and all those persons I have not mentioned yet, provided outstanding service during our stay. We hope to return next year with our family. Teramakaci :)",

              "text": "Let me first start by answering one simple question, would I stay there again?\n\nAnswer:    Absolutely\n\nGreat setup, awesome staff.   \n\nA little more maintenance around the villa would bring it back up to resort quality.    Did this spoil my enjoyment of the villa?     No, we really enjoyed the villa and would book it again.\n\nThe only other observation I would have on the negative side, is the showers could be better cleaned.     Some bleech to kill small traces of mould appearing, and give the shower screens a scrub to get rid of soap scum starting to build up.\n\nHaving said this, the rooms and bathroom are clean, large, and inviting.\n\nOn the positive side.    \n-   Projector for watching movies.    \n-   Kitchen & Large Fridge/Freezer.\n-   Staff are very attentaive\n-   They cook your breakfast in your villa, to your order.   No buffet breakfast here :)\n-   Breakfast was awesome.\n\nWe often could not eat everything they cooked for us, which did leave the staff sometimes a little concerned that we did not like there food.      We LOVED there cooking.\n\nWe decided to go shopping and pickup our own supplies and stock the fridge with water, drinks and nibbles.        You can purchase their soft drinks and nibblies, and they do offer free bottles of water.\n\nTher laundry service is very reasonably priced, and takes the hassle of having to keep going to the local laundry person.",

Back off main streets and very quiet. \n\n4 bedroom villas are really nice and spacious with heaps of room and private full size pool.\n\nEveryone at O Villas are amazing. Fantastic service and our villa cooked breakfast each morning was fantastic (especially the pancakes with chocolate sauce). The in-house cooked dinner was amazing too.\n\nWe used the vIlla driver Wayan for all of our tours and he is amazing. Free shuttle around Seminyak is also available. Approx 10 minute walk and you are in Seminyak Square. Couple of close really nice restaurants - Warung Rumpi (really cold Bintang) and Basil Kitchen (dishes are fresh and tasty and only 50,000 ($5) a dish).\n\nHighly recommend and will definitely be back.",

The villas are large with a big swimming pool and plenty of living space inside and outside \u2013 the open plan kitchen/living area is perfect and for night-time in particular to avoid mosquitos as we have stayed in other villas with only outside living space that were not ideal for us. The team of staff at O\u2019Villas are simply brilliant and could not be more helpful \u2013 they take your order for breakfast and then cook in your villa for you each morning which was excellent food and lots of choice; omelettes were amazing and the kids loved the pancakes! The villas are walking distance to many nice restaurants and Tommy and the team were always on hand if we needed to catch a lift anywhere and great in helping organise day trips for us. Our relatives (4 adults and 3 children) stayed in the villa next door so in total there were 11 people and our experience at O\u2019Villas was fantastic all round. We will definitely return!",

The villas are beautiful with all 4 x bedrooms having king size beds, huge en-suites and 2 x of them had baths as well. \nThe staff were fabulous and the loveliest people you could ever meet and did everything they could to make our holiday perfect. There was a breakfast menu to select from and they\u2019d ask for the time we wanted to eat and they would come into our villa set the table, cook our breakfast and serve it to us. There is a selection of both western and Indonesian breakfasts which pleased even the fussiest eaters and our food was always phenomenal. After breakfast they would ask what our plans were for the day in case we needed to be driven anywhere and would set about organising that for us as well if needed.\nThe pool was huge and easily accommodated all of us for games of \u2018Marco Polo\u2019 and pool volleyball matches. \nHonestly, I can\u2019t rave enough about this place and the amazing time we had here as we  loved our villa and the staff were what made our holiday truly wonderful!!",

We stayed over the New Year period and were again blown away by the service.\n\nMany of the staff that were at the villa during our previous stay were still at O Villa which speaks volumes for the way they enjoy what they do and the way they are treated by the owners.  Nothing is too much trouble for the team.\n\nDespite 3 years of guests the Villa is in top condition and must get constant maintenance to keep it looking so fresh and appealing.\n\nThanks again to the team - we will return!!\n\nPeter",

              "text": "Recently stayed 5 nights in the 1 bed pool villa. The villa was extremely spacious and clean. Although starting to look a little tired the villa was well maintained & clean.  The air con could do with being updated as although adequate it could be a little cooler & a little quieter (air con noisy). Seen better days I think.  Ceiling fans in both rooms was a bonus. \n\nThe TV, stereo & DVD in the lounge room was awesome, although was rarely used. Would be better if the TV in the bedroom was also a DVD player however not an issue but would be a nice alternative.  Electronics a little outdated as well as no option for Bluetooth including seperate iPod docking station speaker that is not current with new iPhones. \n\nUnusual set up of the 1 bed villa with the private pool being located on a lower level (entry to villa) & the villa itself located on an an upper level with approx 14 steps & steep staircase.  Would've preferred all being on the same level. \n\nThe breakfast included with the room rate was delicious & varied & delivered at time appropriate to you in the villa. They even come back approx 30 mins after serving it to collect the used items.  Although a nice touch I think this would be more appropriate to collect when they clean the room whilst you are out unless otherwise requested. \n\nThe staff also come into your villa at dusk to switch the outside & pool lights on & to remove the cushions on the outdoor furniture.  I feel this a little intrusive but they are very discreet.  Would be nice if they left the pools towels though as it's nice to have a quick swim when getting back to the villa after having dinner out. \n\nThe staff are amazingly friendly & eager to help with any request.  This alone would persuade me to stay in these villas again. \n\nThe villas are also in a great location with many restaurants & markets close by. They also offer free transport to/from the airport as well as the Seminyak area.  This itself is a massive positive for me. \n\nA special mention to Katut who was most welcoming & friendly throughout our entire stay.  Would definitely recommend the OVillas for a stay in Seminyak. \n\n",

Kadek was our driver quite a few times and my kids loved hearing his stories. He was so kind to my children ages 13, 11 and 10. The kids LOVED staying in the nice rooms and swimming in the pool. My father in law had a massage every morning. It was a nice start to his day. Only $8USD/hour. I would definitely come here again!",

The staff were so friendly and always there to help. Breakfast was always on time and delicious! Whenever we needed a ride somewhere they were always available and they even offered to pick us up if we needed.

All the staff were wonderful, friendly and very helpful with anything you asked them e.g. good recommendations for restaurants in Seminyak ( Happy Chappy, Ginger Moon and Ultimo). The breakfast was very good and made to order in the villa at your requested time. The room service was also of a high standard. Chauffeur service was also very good taking you and bringing you back from restaurants. We did a tour to Ubud one of the days with one of the drivers from the villas. You must have a night at Frankenstein\u2019s - a great night out. Finns Beach Club was first class and staff looked after us all day. Great first trip to Bali, hopefully we will return some day.",

I have had many trips to Bali and this is the 1st villa i have stayed in twice, as i loved it so much last time. We where greeted at airport by Kadek and taken promptly to our air conditioned villa.Your breakfast order ie nasi goreng, pancakes or full cooked breakfast is taken the night before and cooked at your desired time. Juice is fresh juice with fruit platter, pastries, toast and tea and coffee. The aircon worked very well and our room was always cool when we arrived back. The living area was large with great aircon as well as water cooler. The fridge was stocked with ice and drinks and you just used as desired, at a reasonable price and where billed at check out.Snack foods ie peanuts and pringles where also available. Security was always in place and we felt very safe. The pool was always clean and a lovely temperature. Rooms where cleaned very well. The courtesy driver Kadek was fantastic. We just had to ask and the driver would drive us to restaurants, spas or shopping. Then would pick us up as well a fantastic service for the 6 of us, even though we all did different things. Kadek even helped us when TV wouldn't work at 10 pm. We just hope our tips where divided evenly. We noticed our money was dived into an envelope by the sullen looking head maid, when the staff where outside. We appreciated the drivers, cleaning and cooking staff evenly and hope the tips are distributed fairly.",

              "text": "We stayed arrived into Bali very early on Sunday April 1st. As there were 7 of us (Family of 5 and the grandparents visiting from Denmark) we needed 2 vans to take us to the hotel. Mr Kadek and Mr Katut where on hand to collect us. As our Villa was only being vacated that day, we were unable to check in early. The staff were most apologetic about it and offered to hold our bags and drive us into the Seminyak Square where we could get some light shopping and breakfast.\nRight from the get go, the staff were brilliant. The offer a free shuttle anywhere in Seminyak till very late, so we were able to easily get around. The Villa we stayed in lovely, spacious and clean. The pool was fantastic, with plenty of pool toys for the kids. The Villa itself is extremely private, which we absolutely loved.\nThe room service was excellent, where we had chosen to stay in for lunch and dinner some days. (A few more Indonesian choices wouldn't go amiss though. But still, excellent quality, excellent prices!)\nThe free breakfast was second to none. The choices were extensive and they would come into the villa and cook it for you, right there so everything was so fresh. You had a Nespresso machine in the villa so you could have coffee anytime you wanted for a very reasonable price. Loads of sodas/beers(for excellent prices)/water cooler - so we didn't need to go to the supermarket once! (That has (in all our travels) has never happened!!)\nThe staff were just lovely. Always smiling, always polite, always interested. That makes such a difference when staying in hotels/resorts. Couldn't fault them once! Lovely people.\nWe'll be coming back for sure.\nOne thing I will mention, and it shouldn't deter people staying there. It could do with a touch up of paint. There should also be other options for payment to settle the room service charges. (Their credit card machine wasn't working and we had to get out cash which we didn't have enough of so had to go to an atm, something we wanted to avoid as you end up getting pinged for a bit) The staff were super apologetic and it wasn't their fault at all. Just something the owners could do. (Offer other options ie PayPal )",

The pool was great except it was not sloped \u2013 1.5m all the way which was tough for my 5 year old! The staff was amazing \u2013 very caring, humble and supportive. The breakfast options are fixed few but great taste \u2013 cooked right in the villa kitchen by the chef! The great value adds are the transport \u2013 airport to and from transfers as well as roaming nearby at no extra charge (we didn\u2019t need it as we had our fulltime car but can be great for others)!\n\nI\u2019m recommending my friends and family to stay there if that suits the travel plan! We are definitely going back in future and will look forward to stay again. Thanks team.",

The pool is large , sparkling clean and gets a good amount of sun so the temperature for swimming was perfect for us. The rooms and bathrooms are spacious well maintained and lovely and clean. We also enjoyed the living area which could be closed of and kept cool, which was also very spacious. Breakfasts were fantastic as many other reviews have commented and we found the location to be perfect for us. Still close to walk to a few lovely Warungs (Kultur being one to try) and convenience shops a short walk. BEst of all are the staff at Ovillas, so helpful and nothing is to much trouble. A big thanks to Kutut Tommy Yanti and all the team for looking after us. There is a large team so someone is always around if you need anything. The other great thing is the availability of the car for drop and pick up which was most appreciated and we found a big plus. Big thanks to  Kadek who often drove us with always a smile and we had a great laugh and many interesting conversations. THe booking process was also extremely easy and Lisa was a big help answering our many questions prior to booking. Also a plus for us being able to pay in AUD just simplifies everything. THanks Lisa. Overall so many pluses and nothing to fault. We come to Bali at least twice a year but seldom return to the same villa, but we are already making plans to come back to OVillas next year. Just perfect and thank you.",

We were thrilled with the very large villa, easily could accomodate 2 families in the 4 bdr villa. It was spacious, light and relatively modern. The pool was a large family size, with ample lounges for everyone. Each bedroom had its own bathroom. The staff were fantastic, so accomodating, friendly and even made my birthday something extra special by decorating the villa & making a cake! We would definitely recommend this villa to anyone and would look to stay here again when we next visit. Thanks to all the staff we had an amazing holiday.",

The staff were very accommodating to my early arrival and greeted me with the most welcoming smile. I was truly welcome in their slice of paradise. \nThe Villa itself is stunning.As I wanted some alone chill-out time I cranked some tunes on the in-house stereo and enjoyed the sun, pools and generally wandering about my private villa. \nThe breakfast in the morning was excellent, and I was even driven to grab a fresh coffee in the morning. \nI can not fault the place on any level. I had the best time there - nothing is too much. Next time I am in that neck of the woods I will be booking into O Villas.",

Decided on this villa based on the great reviews, based on our experience it is hard to understand where these came from.we stayed in the one bedroom split level villa with The pool down stairs and the living area upstairs. The villa is dated, the bathrooms are old and very annoying set up with no bath or seperate toilet. The pool is located down stairs which is an inconvenience, and with very little sun exposure. There is no main pool within the complex that you can use instead of. Construction works near by took away from the villa experience. During the day there was consistent drilling going on. The view from this one bedroom villa is not great, an electricity cable and further in the distance is the construction site with a crane. Location is ok, walking to main area of seminyak is fine during the day but at night it is difficult. No pathways and stray dogs. But the villa has a shuttle service and are always willing to drop and pick up. Staff were attentive, almost too attentive and random entries into the villa without notification on two occasions was not appreciated.",

We also now ensure that all guests upon check-in are aware that whenever complete privacy is preferred there is a privacy please plaque on the villa entrance door to be used at their convenience. \r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that there is much construction going on in many areas of Bali and the disruption it can cause to a normally very quiet part of Seminyak. We are constantly monitoring progress of new developments around us and we do try to do whatever we can to minimise disruption to our guests if there is external noise from workers.\r\n\r\nThe 1-Bedroom villa is a different layout to our more prominent accommodation of 2/3/4 Bedroom villas and it is with regret that the layout and facilities were not to your liking. We do have detailed floor plans and images on our website of our accommodation options to assist in making accommodation choices easier.\r\n\r\nWe thankyou for your review and opportunity to address your comments.",

We are traveling in a group of 6 and most villa are 1 or 2 bedroom. The 6 of us stayed at O Villa from 7 Aug to 10 Aug 2014. The price was affordable, we paid less than SGD100/pax/night for a huge yet cozy, clean & well equippied villa (with private pool). We have in fact booked the 3 bedroom villa but was provided the 4 bedroom villa. The staffs were extremely attentive, polite and friendly. \n\nLet me start from the experience right when we step out from the airport. We were fetch by the drivers (by two separate cars because we had 6 of us and around 6 luggages/baggages). We were first given cold towel each to refresh ourselves & bottles of mineral water were provided during our journey to the villa. O Villa is located at Seminyak, thus it took us approximately 25 minutes. Once we arrive at the villa we were fascinated by how pretty it was. It look fairly modern with a mixture of Bali-style. We were being serve our welcome drinks at the living room. \n\nSpeaking of the space, there is a living room where you could watch dvds (they have quite a number of selection) on projector screen & there is a docking station where you could play the songs from your iphone. Just behind the living room (same space), is where the kitchen & bar is, with a long dining table at the side. Every morning butler will prepare breakfast for us in the kitchen. Breakfast served were rather good especially the porridge and fried rice. The pool is of good size for swimming, each bedroom has a big warobe, safebox & individual toilet. Bedroom 2, 3 and 4 are located at 2nd storey & Bedroom 1 is the only room located at level 1 just beside the pool. Bedroom 1 & 2 both have bathtub in the toilet while Bedroom 3 & 4 have two rainshower each. \n\nBefore our trip we had arranged for a surprise bachelorette party on the day of arrival (first night). We arranged for decoration, bbq and some other food. We were suppose to be out till evening and when we were back, the villa was so beautifully decorated. They even set our dining table just beside the pool and it was awesome. I would be uploading the pictures so you don't have to imagine how it look like :) We were happy with the service provided by O Villa & very thankful for their help with the successful surprise party. \n\nO Villa is not located right infront of any beach. But it is located less than 10 minutes drive away from Potato head, Kudeta & Metis. The good thing is O Villa provide shutter services in Seminyak. \n\nThe thing that stop me from giving this an excellent rating was due to the shared heater in Room 1 & 2. I guess we probably had used up the heated water & the switch was off. But this happened for two consecutive mornings & we had to resort to going to the unoccupied room at Room 4 to take our bath. Another important thing was that it's wifi connection was rather weak within the villa.\n\nApart from these 2 points, I would say that O Villa is definitely worth the stay. 6 people in 1 villa is a hella lot of fun!",

The villas are well designed for groups of friends and family travelling together with the separate living area to bedrooms it allows guests to create their own private holiday escape. You and your friends sound like you made the most of your holiday and we are so pleased to hear you had so much fun.\r\n\r\nSince your stay we have made some significant investment into both the wifi technology with each villa now having it's own router and separate water tanks have now been installed to provide the upper bedrooms their own water source, fixing any water heating or pressure issues.\r\n\r\nThankyou for allowing us to assist with you party celebration, and we hope that it was a holiday your friends will remember and we hope to see you all back in Bali again soon.",

We are a family of 4 people ( kids of 10 et 12), we stayed 8 nights in Ovillas.\nThe staff is really amazing : 18 persons just for you. nice and so helpful. We never had a service like that before , better than all the 5 stars we made.\n\nWe discover Bali in the best way possible\nThe Villa is really beautiful, including modern equipments like Home Cinema with Videoprojector, \nwe loved to have our luxuous car with driver , our chief for breakfast, \nWe took the Barbecue diner: they buy the food and cook it in front of us: Great Experience.\nWe make also clean\nFood in the Villa is really good and cheap ( not overcharged like in other 5 stars hotel).\nOVillas is located in a quiet place in Seminyak ( the upper area of Bali) , less than 5 mn to the center.\nThe Swimming pool is very nice and big. The Beach is 5 mn by car and it's very nice and clean.\nInternet was slow sometimes, I told to the butler and he fixed it very quickly\nI recommend for sure  : Ovillas is a Must do.",

They are there 24/7 with security guards, amazing chefs and excellent butlers and drivers who can take care of anything you need. Whether it be an afternoon snack or needing a driver for the day! The 4 bedroom villas are beautiful, each with the privacy of their own bathrooms, dining room, lounge and massive pool! Each day (after i left my room a bit of a mess!!) i would come home to a perfectly clean bedroom and bathroom! We never stay anywhere else, as we love these villas and our balinese family too much! Would definitely recommend. Would also recommend near by restaurants such as Jemme (especially for sunday roasts), Ultimo (Italian) and Frankensteins Laboratory (awesome themed cabaret show/dinner - just opened up!)\nLove always, see you again soon!",

              "text": "The \"villa\" for 2 persons we had was in reality an apartment on top of the office and kitchen of the administration building. The 1m deep \"pool\" at the ground floor was very small, surrounded by walls. No pleasure to use it despite the two sun beds which have been there more for optical reasons. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately there is a big gap to achieve the perfection and skills we expected. It does not help to wear this typical balinese butler outfit. Breakfast was very average. Obviously also untrained staff in the kitchen. The individual shuttle service was good despite sometimes, depending on the driver, we had to help with my Google maps on my Ipad to find the place we wanted to go. Within Seminyak! Wellknown restaurants and hotels! All offered services like massage and lunch/dinner are done by sub contractors. So we didn't make use of it and went to the original place. Better and much cheaper. Because of booming Bali Ovillas are surrounded of construction work from all directions. Noisy 7 days a week from 8am until 9pm. Wake up call not necessary because there is a very loud siren at 8pm every day to signalize the workers to start. And this construction is a huge hotel which means this takes at least another year to be completed. No fun and on top we could not use the \"privacy\" of our apartment because the workers were able to view into our private area. We have been several times in Seminyak. So we know lots of alternatives. At least the competition amongst the villa owners is so big that they invest a lot into marketing and shiny web pages. The agencies are doing a perfect job in this regard.  Ovillas is a victim of them. No value for the money you have to spend. Very unprofessional.",

              "text": "We have just returned from 9 wonderful nights staying in Villa 2.  I know now what it must be like for the very wealthy, who have people on hand to do everything for them.\nWhen you first arrive there is a tendency to think that you have made a mistake, because, access is down what looks to be somewhat dodgy laneway. This is not that unusual in Semenyak.\n\nThe first indication that all is well arrives when you are met by 4 people including your \"Butler\" you are escorted in to the villa and shown into the beautifully airconditioned lounge dining room/kitchen, where you are served Ice tea and given a very cold towel (very welcome after a long journey), from there you get a tour of the villa, whilst your bags are being brought in and taken to your rooms.\nWe booked via Wotif, who had a somewhat vague description of the property, it was last minute so we thought we would be stuck with \"Self Catering\".  A quick call to O Villa in Australia confirmed to me that Breakfast was included in our price (No mention of that on Wotif) every morning our own personal Butler and Chef came to our villa and cooked Eggs any way, bacon, sausage Baked Beans, mushrooms; my daughter wanted pancakes so they made them for her, there is also Nasi Gorng, Mee Goreng Chicken Porridge. Add to that Pastries, Fruit platters and an endless supply of toast.\n\nPart of the trip was to celebrate my Son's 18th Birthday, so we asked for a barbecue, when we arrived back at the Villa from a day out in Nusa Dua, there was a chef cooking Satay sticks,  Fish Kebabs, pork chops, jacket potatoes on a sort of Weber style barbecue and all cooked to perfection, inside we had fried rice, potato salad and various sauces; the room had been decorated with a huge sign on one wall saying Happy Birthday Iain, we also had local decorations suspended from the ceiling. In total we had four people serving and cooking food.\n\nThe location could be a problem, except whenever we wanted to go anywhere we merely picked up the phone and a car was brought around for us.  Here is the fun bit, they have two cars, one is a Suzuki People mover and the other is a Volkswagen Kubelwagen. The VW is one very cool car, people stop in the street and wave, every one likes this car even my wife got a buzz out of being picked up at Ultimo restaurant in the middle of Seminyak, very quickly there was a crowd gathered to look at the car.  A word of warning, only use this an a rain free night, there is no aircon and the roof most probably will leak under Balinese type rain!\nKadek, Richard and all the other staff are simply wonderful people who cannot do enough for you.  The villas are spotless and very quiet at night, I have no hesitation in recommending O Villas to anyone.",

              "text": "My sisters and I stayed in the 'apartment' villa which was a 1 bedroom (extra bed was set up in the living room) apartment but more than enough room. The villa was very clean and the staff were incredibly attentive and helpful. Our stay included complimentary breakfasts each day and free shuttles (a personal driver to escort us) around Seminyak to restaurants and sites when we needed a lift. The staff were very flexible when our plans changed and a lot of the time, they helped us book spas, restaurants etc the day before. We also used their in-villa massage service (paid seperately) which was very efficient and affordable and the villa supplied complimentary bug spray and adaptors.\n\nThe room service menu was a limited but handy for a quick snack, and their extended dinner menu (based on the price of local ingredients) was a little pricier. The bathroom door is made of glass though and they have a vertical drawstring blind for privacy which got a little annoying to use but some people might not like this.\n\nThe villa itself is located a few mins drive from the main street in Seminyak and in a secluded backstreet. A lot of the time when we taxi-ed back to the villa, the drivers didn't recognise the name of the villa so we had to tell them to take us to \"Kunja Villa\" which was around the corner. Again, a minor complaint.\n\nThe management were very attentive also. They offered us complimentary late checkout if noone had booked our apartment on the day we left and Lisa was always on hand to answer any questions I had.\n\nCould not recommend this villa enough! Definitely a boutique stay, if you're looking for something quiet, secluded, with 5 star service and friendly staff!",

              "text": "Stay on march 16-20 in the 4 bedroom villa(Villa 3) but only booked 3 bedroom with one being locked. \n\nPros-\n\nVilla was clean,modern with luxury finishing and peaceful.Air con was working well. Good brand for complimentary  coffe(Nescaf\u00e9) and assorted tea (twinings) provided.Nice to have a nespresso machine and cubes(chargeable but reasonable price).Price for mini bars, room service, lunch, dinner and BBQ menus are reasonable which also taste great. \nThe daily in villa cooked breakfast provided was delicious with good varieties. \n\nGreat to have a projector screen together with home theatre system in the living room which is very rare in other villas in bali. Nice to have LCD TVs in the living room and all bedrooms. Also all bedrooms have bathroom attached but only bedroom 1 and 2 have bathtubs with bedroom 1 had an additional outdoor standing shower which is great. There's also extra toilet  and outdoor shower beside the pool which is very convenient. Good to have a sliding doors in the living and dining rooms to keep the sun and mosquito away when needed as mentioned by other reviews. Private pool was nicely design with shallow area for kids,water features and temperature was not too cold even at night. Floaties and pool toys are also provided for the kids.\n\nShuttle service around seminyak area provided was good as they even can wait if you decide to do a quick shopping like buying groceries,DVDs,etc or if you take longer they can pick you up instead of drop off only service provided by other villas. Reasonable price for the day tour and nice touch to provide complimentary mineral waters and wet towels for the tour.\n\nButlers Yanti,Richard and kadek was friendly,provide great service and willing to go extra mile.\n\nCons-\n\n1 of the in room safe was not working and would be repair the next day which I was informed upon arrival but it was not fixed throughout my stay even after reminding them on the 3rd day. Tired of reminding I just share the safe at other rooms. Despite being friendly and the great service, I expect staffs to be more aware.\n\nAfter spending around SGD $2700 for the stay excluding mini bars,room service and in villa BBQ, day tour,etc, I'm disappointed to be charged 150 000 rupiah (SGD$16) for one broken bottle glass of the complimentary shampoo which my niece dropped. Despite that I didn't argue and paid but this should be waived and 150 000 rupiah (SGD $16) for that is just ridiculous. The wheelchair for my grandma which I requested for the day tour and was quoted 50 000 rupiah per day via the email by Lisa the marketing manager but was charged 75 000 rupiah per day instead. And when I asked about the difference in price, the staff mentioned that price quoted in the email was only for usage in the villa and it cost more to bring it out for the day tour which was not mentioned in the email itself and find it ridiculous. Again I never argue and still paid. Please state the prices clearly in the email. Also Lisa, understand that you are in Australia so can you please pass down the message to the staffs about the arrangement and request made via the email with you clearly as they seem not to be informed about some of the arrangement and request.\n\nIt's better to have a gated entrance with the security post beside it similar to some other villas,resorts and hotels around instead of the security post located along the lane to the villas.\n\nDespite the cons, I still will recommend the villas to others and hope to be back due to the villas being clean,luxury finished and peaceful. Also great services by Richard,Yanti and Kadek. Hope the villas will still be well maintained over the years and the cons mentioned will be look into and improve.\n\nHairudin\nSingapore",

              "text": "We have just returned from 2 weeks staying at O villas and we had a great time, very relaxing and easy. O villas have 3 3bedroom villas and one 1bedroom villa. We stayed in the one bed. There were several boxes I wanted ticked before selecting O villas, I wanted a pool, an air conditioned villa that you could close up if you wanted a break from the heat and Mosquitos with a comfortable couch and DVD player. These things are not as easy as you think to find but O villas was the perfect choice in this regard. Initially  I was disappointed to see that the pool was on a different level from the villa ( down a flight of stairs and only the case for the 1 bed ) but in the end it didn't matter too much, I just couldn't yell out to hubby to get me another drink if he was upstairs! \nEach morning the staff asked your plans, if you needed the car to take you anywhere or a restaurant booked. We wanted to see a tailor and they made a good recommendation dropped us there etc. \n\nA smallish complex, but 17 staff to cater to all your needs, we required vegetarian diet and the chef made us many good meals.\n\nThe location wouldn't suit everyone, 10-15 mins walk to ultimo if you know the area but was fine for us, the villa was down a lane and very quite and peaceful. \n\nOverall great value for money and would recommend.",

We had most of our meals cooked by their chefs and they did a fantastic job to fulfil our demanding taste requirements for both the children and our elderly mother. \n\nGreat pool design and generous size to play in. Welcoming staffs always working hard attending to our needs. Plus providing free transport to nearby Seminyak Square for food and simple shopping and marketing. Though away from main road, it does provide a quiet, relax and tranquil environment to escape from our urban lifestyle. Definitely highly recommend and will sure stay in same villa for our next Bali trip.",

              "text": "We stayed in Villa 2 for nine nights. We took advantage of a special extra two nights for the price of seven nights. Whilst a little out of the way from the crowds of Seminak, it is still fairly convenient and in a nice quite area. Although in stating this, there is a new complex being built next door so when the serious building activity starts to take place it may not be that quite. We had access to the full four bedrooms and the Villa was very comfortable for our family of six but easily can accommodate more. The rooms, bathrooms and living areas all extra-large in size. Our friends were staying in the Villa (same complex) next door so I would also recommend O Villas for multiple family groups or friends travelling together. Our first couple of days were a bit disappointing. When we arrived the power kept tripping. This progressively got worse until the point where we were without power for 18 hours whilst they found the fault. Dug the yard up and replaced the wiring. Lucky we had access to the Villa next door to use the bathrooms as the water supply was also power dependent. For our inconvenience we were offered a tour for the day (we did not take up as we had other plans) and also a free dinner which we accepted. Outside of this issue, our stay was excellent. The food options onsite are great. Breakfast is included and excellent. We ordered room service on a number of occasions and a BBQ (big selection) twice, just need to order a few hours in advance. One day we went deep sea fishing and arrived back with a big haul of Tuna. The chef cleaned, cooked (four different ways) and served our catch as part of the BBQ. There was plenty left over for the staff. Service from butlers, room attendants and drivers is all well above average. In fact the staff make the biggest difference. We have stayed at numerous, hotels and private Villa\u2019s in Bali. O Villas offers overall, great value for money for upscale accommodation. If I was to get picky outside of the power issue. The bathroom soap dispensers need replacing, the pumps just do not work well. Our pond also had a water pump that was not functioning but if that is all I can find as faults, O Villas comes highly recommended.",

The monsoonal weather conditions that Bali experience are unfortunately renowned to effect many 5* hotels and fine world dining restaurants on occasion. Due to the conditions and the power issues we opted to have the power box to the villa moved to location which would result in a long term solution rather than a quick fix. The work to remedy the situation did take longer than we would have liked. We certainly did not foresee such issues and it is with regret that we were fully booked at the time to not be able to move you to another villa at first sign of an issue whilst the work was carried out.\r\n\r\nWe are pleased to hear that our staff tried to accommodate you in this situation the best they could, please accept our sincere apologies for this inconvenience to you and your family during your holiday.\r\n\r\nI was pleased to hear of your successful fishing expedition and that you allowed our chef to prepare and our staff to share in the catch.\r\n\r\nWe have checked and replaced any faulty bathroom dispensers and the fish pond pump is back to good working order. As part of our process in reviewing guests reviews we have updated our property inspection reports to include such items to ensure the villas are maintained at the high level of standard we expect.\r\n\r\nOur local General Manager is in contact with the developers regarding the next door building. All trades and building projects are built by hand in Bali who work to strict day time work schedules. We expect little to no disturbance to our guests. We are however closely monitoring the progress and will ensure if the situation changes we will be in-contact with future guests. \r\n\r\nThankyou again for the review and we would very much like the chance to have you and your family stay with us again, please contact me via reservations the next time you plan to travel to Bali.",

From the moment we walked in we were blown away- the beautifully furnished living area, massive bedrooms, huge en-suites, outdoor shower, tranquil pool and lush gardens were just stunning. \nThe villa's layout provided our party of 9 with the opportunity to hang out and play together, or to retreat into our own areas when we needed.\nThe staff were always friendly and willing to help wherever they could- nothing was too much trouble. My request for cot/highchair and stair gates were ready and waiting upon our arrival.\nMeals were fantastic, including a range of free breakfast options- western/indonesian/healthy.\nWe'll definitely be back.",

If you make sure to have a card on you where the villa actually is though, then it isn't so bad. I definitely agree with the service aspect, they are all so lovely, but they didn't treat our villa as \"private\" and actually walked in on us one time when we probably didn't want them too, so maybe just some knocking beforehand! The villa and room itself was spectacular, very clean and modern. The breakfast every morning was very fresh and well cooked. We even had a night in where they cooked for us with the BBQ on the balcony, absolute bliss!",

As there is much development going on in the Seminyak area  and with O Villas still being new, some local taxi drivers are familiarising themselves with our location. We are hoping this improves over time. Thankyou for the great tip to other guests in regards to taking with them one of the business cards when going out. The location map on the back helps the local drivers easily find their way to the villas\r\n\r\nWe at O Villas respect your privacy and it is with concern to read your comments. We do have policies in place for ringing the doorbell before entering, this is something we will ensure all of our butlers carry out. In respect for your privacy we also have \u2018Privacy Please\u2019 plaque on the villa entrance door which will ensure complete privacy at your discretion.",

We felt so cared for and well looked after from the moment we were met at the airport until they returned us. \nThe villa is absolutely beautiful and even looks better than in the photos. You will very much feel like you are staying at a 5 star hotel.  The bedrooms are large and the bathrooms are enormous! With very modern and lovely furnishings. \n  We had excellent service by the staff and they were always smiling and friendly and we found they were not obtrusive at all.  The food was scrumptious.. do take advantage and have the chef prepare your dinner or lunch.  We have 2 very picky eaters in our family and both were quite pleased by the chef's preparations and meeting of our requests. \n   We felt like the staff made our stay...  you can have a beautiful building anyplace,, but it is rare to encounter such a well trained, friendly, \"can do\" staff!! \n  We were able to walk to town very easily and we even walked from the beach and walked as far as Legian. \n  We loved having the private pool and the lovely chairs to lay about on. \nIt was an excellent stay!",

The location is a bit out of the way and you have to plan everything in advance, so we ran into a couple times when they didn't have the car on hand and we had to walk into town (we encountered a feral dog on one occasion) or we wanted to change our plans last minute but felt hemmed in because we had already told them our entire schedule at the beginning of the trip. Also it depends on what you like, the service is great but the staff are always around, it's a private villa but (for example) if you want to swim/sunbathe topless or do anything private they are always coming in and out unannounced! Though saying that Kadek was a great addition to the villa, he was our private tour driver and was very sweet. The villas are beautiful and a great value for the money spent but I like my privacy and not having to plan so much in advance so I would probably stay elsewhere next time, but that's a personal choice! It's a great place otherwise.",

As featured on our website our location is an approx. 10 minute walk to the main shopping and dining district of Seminyak. Where possible we offer the complimentary shuttle service in and around the area for our guests. We would like to accommodate each of our guests personal arrangements with the two cars we own. On occasion we however have booked tours and arrival and departure commitments. Our staff will always try and accommodate everyone and can arrange alternate taxi or driver service if required. \r\n\r\nAs in most Asian countries local dogs do wonder around quite freely and it is nothing unusual in or around any part of Bali, although Seminyak is not renowned for have particular problems.\r\n\r\nIt is with further regret to hear about your privacy concerns, our villas are butler attended and they are expected to ring the door bell before entering and to make themselves available to our guests. We have raised this with our staff to ensure this practise is carried out at all times and can only apologise. We would have liked the opportunity to remedy this during your stay to make your stay a more relaxed and comfortable one and we do ask whenever our guests would like complete privacy to make use of the \u2018Privacy Please\u2019 plaque located on the villa entrance door.\r\n\r\nThankyou for the comments on Kadek he is a valuable member of team and we receive numerous compliments from his tours. \r\n\r\nThankyou again for your review and we hope you enjoy your future trips to Bali.",

They even provide floats and balls which was very thoughtful of them.  The staffs was very good.  The butlers were very well trained.  Breakfast was very good, well served.  We had BBQ in the evening, and the food was delicious, it is a must, the fresh seafood and the sos was wonderful.  And best of all after such a wonderful meal, you don't have to even clean your plates, nothing beats the service.  After that you could sit back and enjoy a DVD (they have quite a selection) and a beer or even a glass of wine.  The price for the mini bar are reasonable.  We also enjoyed the massages beside the pool.  They also provide shuttle service/driver to drive us to Kuta, Seminyak area which was very good.

The bedrooms were enormous, the pool sparkling clean and I loved the outdoor shower off the main bedroom.  The staff were fantastic. Ketut, Richard and the Cook were brilliant.  Walking distance to the town of Seminyak and a short taxi ride to the beach.  Cannot praise this property highly enough.",

              "text": "My husband and I stayed here for our first leg of our honeymoon Bali trip. This place is very simple, beautiful and clean. Everything is pretty modern which I really enjoyed. We stayed in their \"Apartment Villa\" (one bedroom) and everything was up to our standards. We loved how we were welcomed when we arrived with a drink and the staff waiting. We were escorted to our villa and showed around. They even had a lovely bag set up with bug spray, sun block, key chain, etc. They truly do pay attention to all the small details here to make you truly feel welcome. More than the place itself we loved and appreciated all the staff. We were greeted every morning with delicious food (a menu you can pick from every day for the following morning) and they also made sure to ask more than once if there was anything else we needed or if they could help with anything. We actually hired one of the staff -Kardek to drive us around Bali for 2 days. They matched the prices with what the tour companies would charge for a full day and we were able to make our own itineraries and enjoy taking our time with each spot we visited. The vehicles were clean, air conditioned, and they even sent us with an ice chest full of cold drinks (again the small details!) On the other nights they do offer a free shuttle to take you into the city of Seminyak. Do remember though to get \"business cards\" from the staff to help make your return trip easier- since this is a fairly new villa some of the taxi drivers did not know where it was and the cards definitely made it easier. I would honestly say the only downfall of this villa is its location. It is somewhat off the beaten path, a small driveway that leads to it but is not really accessible to walk into the city. If you want somewhere more secluded then this is for sure the spot. I guess because there are so many villas throughout the city its good to look at different locations to see what you would be by.",

The facilities are amazing, especially the 4 bedroom villa will the beautiful lap pool!!  We especially appreciated that the Alfresco areas of the villa's could be fully closed off with full folding glass doors.  Most of the other villas we researched did not have this feature and thus are continuously exposed to the elements and the Mozi's!\n\nSpeaking of Mozi's.  We were pleasantly surprised that we only encountered two or three our entire stay.  My wife is especially sensitive to them and she normally attracts them like a magnet.  No doubt our being able to close the full folding doors in the evening was helpful in making Mozi's a complete non-event!\n\nThe staff at Ovilla's are beautiful, kind, helpful and friendly!  We wish we could take them all home with us.  They truly try their best to pamper and satisfy every request, and seem genuine and sincere about their desire to make our holiday unforgettable! \n\nMy wife and I are both dreaming of our next trip to Bali and we definitely desire to stay once again with our lovely friends at this very special oasis in the heart of Seminyak. \n\nJ & V\n\nPS: The restaurants in the area of the Villa are many. varied, and excellent!!",

The daily freshly prepared breakfast a treat, and the rooms and bathrooms spacious and comfortable. The staff were available and helpful at all times. \nThankyou to the chef for a specially prepared seafood banquet for a family occasion. It was delicious and much more convenient than going out to celebrate with young children. We would recommend O Villas as a delightfully friendly and relaxed way to wind down and 'chill out'. The pool and day bed were just perfect. \nThe location was close to some really interesting bars and restaurants, so the young adults in our group also enjoyed the location. \nThankyou to the O Villa's staff for your assistance and suggestions - you were all so friendly, polite and helpful!",

The place looked as good or better in real life compared to the photos, the staff were very friendly and so helpful. They made breakfast for us every morning, which costs a very little amount, they drove us into town for free or if we wanted a longer trip to visit a place they charged us a small amount and they came with us for the day. They were also great with recommending places to visit or bars to go to. The rooms were terrfic and cleaned every day. It is a good location as well, as you are far enough away from the main part of town that it is quiet, but you can take a small 15 minute walk into town if you like. It is also a good place if you want to hang around the pool and have a quiet day.",

The villa itself is second to none, presentation was always immaculate, the photos don't do this place justice! Very easy to have a lazy day in the villa and relax, or the staff will be more than willing to drive you to many of the tourist attractions Bali has to offer for half or full days for very reasonable prices to hire the mini bus. Fridge was always stocked with drinks, which costs next to nothing to have replenished, and the food was excellent. Will definitely return for my next Bali holiday!",

The food is top notch and you can't go past it at all, fresh and cooked right there and then. the transport services they provide are exceptionable and handy whenever you want to go anywhere. The rooms are spotless, clean and comfortable, more than anyone could ask for. Overall it was an amazing experience and would definitely recommend it to anyone travelling to Bali!!",

I was told about these villas from a friend who stayed there and being a former villa owner in Bali I thought that they would be the same as most villas in Bali? From the outside nice but when inside most are a bit old and run down, well these are certainly not, they even have huge projector screens as well as a fantastic range of DVD to watch. \nWe stayed in a few times to eat and this was a fantastic experience, the service was 5 star and the food was as good as anything I have eaten at the best restaurants in Bali. If you like breakfast then you will love it here, the young girls who cook for you do the best omelet you could ever taste, just YUMMY,!!\nThanks to Putu ( the villa manager) and all his staff, you are a fantastic group and really do go out there way to make sure you have a great time at O Villas.\nLooking forward to seeing you all again, Jimmy (Stuart)",

Kadek our driver was informative and friendly, Richard and Ketut our Bultlers were polite, helpful and lovely people.  The meals were beautiful and all the staff went out of there way to make our Bali experience one to remember.  Thank you so much O Villas for our wonderful holiday, we will be back.",

From the friendly pick at the airport (with cold drinks and face washers) to the immaculately kept Villa and friendly nature of the staff where nothing was too difficult - I was in pure bliss all week. Relaxation is possible here even for someone that struggles. Breakfasts were cooked in house with full table service leaving not a worry in the world. After breakfast the next biggest decision was to relax by the pool or go and explore Seminyak. I loved the staff and really enjoyed Seminyak with its chilled vibe, endless restaurants and extraordinary architecture and landscapes.  Thank you O Villa making my stay one that I shall cherish.",

I celebrated my Birthday there and was given an amazing party in the villa with decorations, traditional Balinese dancers, bbq, mojitos and cake \u2013 nothing is too much trouble. The villas are top notch, clean, roomy and private with all your needs more than catered for \u2013 the staff are excellent. Breakfast of your choice is cooked and served daily and was yum- we all felt really spoilt!\nThe villas have a great sound system and even a projector screen if you fancy watching a movie.  The beds are the comfiest I have ever slept in.\nRelaxing by the pool is bliss and to top the day off we arranged for a full body Balinese massage whilst laid on the comfy sunbeds by the pool. \nA must - make the most of the food -You can order room service from 10am-10pm I recommend the beef burger or chicken burger, they are spot on. You can also pre-order dinner (3 Hours before) and it is prepared fresh, our group all had something different on the menu \u2013 everything was delicious.",

Villas were a short drive to Seminyak shops and the beach and the staff were always happy to drive us anywhere we wanted. O Villas organised a half day tour to Tanah Lot for us and their driver waited around while we shopped and ate lunch. Breakfast was prepared in our villa kitchen each day and lunch or dinner could be ordered and made on request. All the food was amazing. Thank you to all the staff, we can't wait to come back. Highly recommend.",

              "text": "The service at O Villas is absolutely 5 star! From serving ice cold water at the airport pick up, to the most amazing food and anything else we asked for it was always \"no problem\". We had a group of 8 people and stayed in the four bedroom villa. The villa has huge rooms all with ensuite, a large lounge/dining room and a private pool. There is so much room we never felt crammed on top of each other. The breakfast is amazing! Cooked and served in the villa, with enough choice to have something different every day. Even cornflakes were served when the children wanted cereal.We ate from the room service menu a few times. The food is excellently prepared and has a good range of western and Indonesian dishes. One night we ordered dinner to be prepared. Meals are prepared in the main kitchen and you pay for ingredients plus 20%. We had fish, steak and pork dishes all of high standard and incredibly cheap compared to restaurants in Seminyak. The pool area was so relaxing it was difficult to go out and experience Seminyak. Free transport to Seminyak was \"no problem\". If a car is not available the reception staff will call a taxi, costs around A$1-A$2.50 one way to Seminyak.We were even taken to Winehouse to buy some wine (around A$35/bottle). Casa Gourmet in Seminyak Square also sells wine. Ask the staff as there are WA wines with Balinese labels for A$20.We did have dinner at a lovely Japanese restaurant near Seminyak Square (not Ryoshi) but I forget the name. Most restaurants require a booking for dinner but the staff at O Villas can help you with that too! What more can I say? If you stay at O Villas be prepared to relax and be treated like royalty. A special thank you to Ketut and Agung who ensured our every needs were met. We can't wait to come back!",

They just couldn't do enough for the guests; it truly was a 5 star service experience. Great varied menu (both Indonesian and Western style food) for eating at home with the food always perfectly prepared. Throw in the fantastic pool, the use of the 2 scooters and being chauffeur driven in the funky open top VW jeep to town at night and it all added up to a truly memorable stay.",

This is my 6th time to Bali, and still - Wow!\nThe rooms, outstanding! Massive beds, spacious rooms with huge & modern en-suite bathrooms. The separate living area is HUGE, stylish, comfortable & spacious enough for all 7 of us to relax.  The pool temperature was perfect, refreshing but not cold, you could easily spend an entire afternoon in the pool with a nice cold beer or cocktail.  Which seem never ending!\nThe service AMAZING!!!  Nothing is too hard or unobtainable for the staff at O Villa's who were always right there, with a nice cold Bintang, cocktail, piece of fruit - whatever!\n\nThey offered restaurant/sightseeing/shopping suggestions, drove us wherever we wanted to go, cooked fabulous, fresh meals... I could go on forever!\n\nJust minutes away from the main strip of Seminyak, airport pick-up/drop off, treated like kings, GREAT value for money - you'd be foolish not to!\n\nWe will all be back for sure.  Big thank  you to Putu, Kadek, Ketut, Richard - EVERYONE who made our stay such a memorable one.",

Good to hear about the pool temperature as we do get asked on many occasions about the pool and i am the same view as yourself, it is refreshing but not cold, and not like jumping into a tepid bath, which can happen in resorts around Asia. \r\n\r\nIt sounds like you took full advantage of all the facilities and services on offer, and utilised the fact the Villas are so close to everything that is great about Seminyak, that is what it is all about.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your great review, and hopefully see you all up there again soon.",

The beds are fantastic and huge rooms, so you never feel cramped up.\nI must mention the staff who are just amazing,they can't do enough to help you and are the most friendliest people I have come across in my 25 years of travelling to Bali. Seminyak is the place many people like to go and eat in Bali, but for me the food at the O Villas is the best I have ever had in Bali, it was just brilliant.\nThe pool is huge and was a great temperature at this time of the year, especially with the ice cold Bintang beers that we were served from the staff.\nFor me this is a must stay again villa and I will defiantly recommend it to anyone wishing to visit Bali.\nMany thanks to everyone again at O Villas, hope to see you again, Stuart.

Good to hear you enjoyed the food, the problem is that it is so good, it is a difficult decision to make, stay in and eat or stroll down to one of the restaurants, nice problem to have though. \r\n\r\nWe will hopefully see you there again Stuart, which will be good news for you as well as it means your Villa is full !\r\n\r\nThanks again",

Where do I start the staff are always available and no task was to hard or a inconvenience and actually felt like family by the time we left and trust any of them with our kids. The villa itself is only believed once you see it cause photos do not do it justice so spacious and new it contributed to making our stay that so much more relaxing where a hotel or resort could not achieve with kids. The breakfast is cooked right in front of you and your able to order what you want to our regret we should of had the villa cook us more meals , cheap and taste was beautiful even try to get Putu to make u chilli crab best ever had. The villa staff where always on hand to drive us for quick trips our day trips and enough cars for big groups. Over all it was the best holiday experience ever had count the days to our next visit for this every day joe to feel like a king again , O villas thank you",

              "text": "We have been to Bali many times, but our stay in O Villas was second to none. Having three small children in a hotel room is not always relaxing, but the experience at O Villa was very enjoyable as the villa was massive with plenty of room for the kids to run around and was good value for money. We loved the pool & spent most of our stay in it, but the living area was great also with a big comfy couch, big flat screen & also a projector screen great for movies. We did our homework & found most places were open air living & didn't have an option to close doors (to keep out mozzies & heat) where as o villas gave us the both options. The service we received was absolutely first class. Staff kept the villa spotless, every meal was fantastic and we regret not eating in the villa more often as compared to restaurants it was much cheaper. Putu's chilli crab he made us on our last day was the best we've had! The staff were always on hand to drive us where ever we needed and even have good scooters to hire. Overall our stay at O Villas was fun & relaxing - i didnt lift a finger- and will become an annual trip each October for us & our extended family. Thanks to Putu, Richard, kadeh & Ketut, we'll see you again soon!!",

The size of the Villas does make a big difference, i can leave the kids to do what they want, and still relax ! It is a good point about being able to close all the living/dining room doors, i get paranoid about the mozzies, and we have ensured all the staff are aware of the western fear of them as well and really look after the grounds and Villas. Our General Manager Putu, is a man of many talents, which sounds like you experienced one them! They are a great team and they love repeat business and look forward to seeing you up there again soon.

Whenever you needed something it was always yes yes yes. \nBreakfast in the morning was always welcome after a good night out and Richard and hs staff always did a great job much appreciated.\nAs for getting around Seminyak the drivers (Kadet and Kedah) were always very helpful and made the time a little more memorable by not having to worry.\nDefinately will be going back to O Villa's in the near future.",

This was our first time in Bali, we were met at the airport by the lovely Kadeh with a cold towel and beer.  Kadeh was our driver for the week and nothing was too much trouble, he really looked after us.  Once arriving at O villas we couldn't believe how much accomadation belonged to us, we could have shared with another family, the bedrooms were very spacious with lovely decor.  The whole villa was immaculately clean throughout our stay. \nThe pool area was so relaxing, all the staff were wonderful and became friends throughout the week. Each morning we were served a wonderful breakfast by the lovely Richard.  The food and service excellent, we were made to feel very special.  One evening we gave the staff some money for groceries and they cooked us a lovely meal in the villa, which made a nice change after a busy day out.\nWe could not have wished for nicer staff, my daughter mentioned she liked chocolate and yes much to her delight some appeared in the fridge.\nIt was great to have a driver and transport whenever we wanted, which was all included, the only time we contributed was a trip to Tanah lot temple. \n My only problem now is that I felt totally spoilt during my stay at O Villas and would not want to stay anywhere else.",

              "text": "Recently spent a week at O Villas, staying with 7 others. We were in the 4 bed room villa which was extremely spacious, much larger than what I thought judging by the photos on their website. \n\nThe first thing we were thinking when we arrived was 'is this all for us?' because again, on the website it looks as if the lap pool might be part of the lobby area. The rooms were massive (especially room 1 on the bottom floor), beds quite comfortable and the bathrooms were spacious. The furnishings everywhere were nice and overall it was quite stylish Although I didn't see all of the upstairs bathrooms, I believe two of them were a little smaller. Still enough space for everyone though. Only complaint about the bathrooms was that the water pressure wasn't great and one of the rooms couldn't get warm water intermittently. \n\nThe pool area was where we spent most of our time, the day bed was great..could comfortably fit four people on there, had a fan in case it was too hot, and their were four sun beds to tan/snooze/star gaze on. There is power at in the day bed so you can move the iPod dock from the lounge room outside which was great and the outside bathroom was really useful. Not that it could really be helped but at this time of year the sun didn't really go over the pool that much, so it was a bit cold. It would have been great if the pool was heated, but might be overkill for the other times of the year. It would also be nice if the outside towels were cleaned more regularly, as they appeared dirty and we couldn't tell if they were washed for the duration of our stay.\n\nBreakfast daily was superb, you had two menus which were basically Western (eggs, bacon, sausages etc) or Asian (Mie Goreng, Nasi Goreng etc) everything was delicious and you could probably order whatever you wanted and the staff would make it for you. 'No Problem.' We ate dinner in the Villa twice which is extremely affordable (pay for ingredients +20%, worked out to be about 400,000 IDR for 8 people per dinner) everything was delicious, only complaint was a couple of the meals weren't quite hot as they tended to bring them out together. I imagine this is because of the small kitchen, just ask them to bring them out as they're ready.\n\nThe staff overall gave us incredible service, nothing was too hard for them, although we probably didn't utilize them us much as we could have. Special mention to Ketut & Kadeh who helped us a lot and were extremely friendly even when we had 'big party' and made quite a mess. The staff drove us anywhere in Seminyak free of charge as well as giving us complimentary transfers to the airport which was much appreciated.\n\nOverall I wouldn't hesitate recommending O Villas to groups, I didn't get to see the 1 bedrooms but can imagine they are of an equal standard and can't wait to go back!",

I have ensured all the staff have been informed, it is important to them, a good motivator.  We hope to see you all there again soon and don't forget to send all your friends !!

Les chauffeurs sont \u00e0 votre disposition pour aller au centre de Seminyak quand vous le souhaitez ou m\u00eame faire des excursions (en suppl\u00e9ment). \n\nLes moins : \n- Les finitions sont \u00e0 \"l'indon\u00e9sienne\" c'est \u00e0 dire que tout y est mais \u00e7a pourrait encore \u00eatre mieux (peinture, prise qui ne tient plus, ampoules grill\u00e9es, ...) \n- La localisation n'est pas au centre mais vu qu'il y a des navettes, ce n'est pas un probl\u00e8me. -\n- Les chauffeurs pourraient avoir un meilleur niveau d'anglais\n\nEn conclusion : Presque parfait malgr\u00e9 quelque d\u00e9tails \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer.",
