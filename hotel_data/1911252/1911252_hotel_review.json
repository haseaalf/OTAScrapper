It was perfect for us - masses of room, private pool, great home cooked breakfast from Chef Wayan who popped in each morning and minutes from the beach.  To get to the beach you have to walk through Sindu market which is great for last minute holiday bargains. We would recommend Sukanada arts - a little art shop at the back of the market where the artist produces his own work and it's all on display. We had a chat with him and while he didn't have anything that matched the colours in our home, he painted something based on our specifications with no obligation on us to buy ( massive risk for him but the piece he produced was so good and so moderately priced we did of course buy it). Back to the villa, staff were really excellent and couldn't do enough to help. I would recommend for those wanting to get away and just have some serious pool time which was all our kids wanted!",

I have fed this back and have been assured by the management that these concerns will be rectified but unfortunately not for our time there.\nWould not go back.\nLynn",

We are happy to hear that you enjoyed our service during your stay. \n\nWith regard to the villa, thank you for your feedback at your checkout time. We have already carried out works in the areas you mentioned: some areas of the villa have been repainted; the loose cabinet door has been repaired and the outside tiles with moss have been cleaned. With regard to the outside furniture, we are in the monsoon season so the sundeck loungers and other all season furniture will have some condensation because of the humid air after any rain. After your departure we investigated the water on the pool deck. This was as a result of excess water from the air conditioners which you insisted on keeping on 24 hours even when you were not at the villa! We understand that you found the weather to be too hot for you, but we ask our guests to switch off the air conditioning units when they are out of the villa to help us protect the environment. We take all feedback from our guests seriously so thank you again for your feedback.\n\nThe Villa Seriska Team",

The Villa accommodated all people beautifully. From the minute we entered the Villa, the staff were fabulous. We were met by Wayan (the chef) and Kadek. Soon after Nilesh (the owner of the Villa) arrived to greet us, and then a little later, Putra - the manager of the Villa came to explain things. Putra was on hand all week by phone to ensure that our travel plans and other needs were met. There is a mobile phone that is available for use to contact any staff for the duration of your stay. Thomas is the driver that works for the villa and is organised to take guests on any adventures (at a very reasonable cost, charged at the end of your stay). \nWayan and one of the girls cooked breakfast daily - and what a great selection of food and delicious. You can also ask for a meal to be cooked for lunch or dinner as needed. We had an Indonesian banquet after our day trip to Ubud and the food was wonderful - thanks Wayan and Kadek!\nThe villa is a walk of a couple of minutes through a small market to the beach where there are plenty of food options for lunch and dinner, and also very close to the main road for food options and shopping. The market is also great for shopping and bargaining. \nIt\u2019s great to have the run of the villa and the pool as needed. The staff are fabulous and can\u2019t do enough for you. Your rooms are serviced each morning, breakfast is cooked, the living space is cleaned up and the turndown service at night ensures that bedrooms are mosquito free for the night. There is also a security guard outside for the night. Always felt very safe. \nWe hope to stay again at the Villa.  It worked brilliantly for 2 families. Thanks to Nilesh, Putra, Wayan, Kadek, Rian, Thomas and Wayan!",

The three connecting rooms make it perfect for families small and large. The private chef provided adds to the luxurious feel of the whole experience. \n\nThe pool is ideal and is located at the centre/ heart of the whole villa which means that each of the rooms have a beautiful view of the pool. The cabana is perfect for relaxing and eating breakfast. The menu offered covers all bases, from American breakfast to pasta or classic Indonesian. \n\nThe location of the villa is perfect, jsut a stone throw away from the beach. The team are beyond helpful and are on hand to help with anything you need, they can help you rent a car, scuba dive or surf. \n\nMy stay was incredible and I\u2019m already considering returning and staying in one of the other villa\u2019s!

It's in a great location with shops, bars and restaurants near by, however we didn't want to leave the villa as it was so beautiful. The best thing about our visit was the service provided by Nilesh the owner and the team of staff. I organised a surprise birthday meal for my partner, 3 members of staff cooked, waited on us and decorated the villa. The food was amazing and so reasonably priced. It was a brilliant LUXURY two night trip. I could not recommend it enough and hope to return one day.  ",

The Villa Seriska is simply stunning, food was great (Wayan the chef is awesome) and the team are the best I have ever experienced.  \n\nI have to thank Nilesh, the owner of the villa, for all his help in answering the multitude of questions I had prior to arriving and then my entire family want to thank the team for making it the best holiday ever.

              "text": "My wife and I could not have asked for a better stay during our honeymoon in Seminyak. First off, the villa is absolutely stunning. It looks exactly like the pictures online, and the private pool area is amazing. Especially at night, it is relaxing and you do not hear any outside noise or traffic. Nilesh, the owner, greeted us once we arrived and was always in constant communication. You can tell he takes a tremendous amount of pride in this property and wants to make sure you're having the best time possible. Putra is a member of his staff and took care of us throughout our entire stay. He arranged breakfast for us each morning (delicious), called us taxis when we wanted to explore the beach (5-minute drive) and personally made sure that we had everything we needed. We were very impressed with Putra and his service makes us want to come again. Having someone that genuine and caring is always appreciated when traveling somewhere for the first time\n\nI don't do a lot of traveling and I'm not a very good planner (according to my wife), so I was really hoping to knock it out of the park with this villa, and it happened. Great location, amazing staff and of course, beautiful Bali. I would recommend this villa to anyone looking for a private getaway in the heart of Seminyak. I very much love Bali and would absolutely stay here again. Thanks Nilesh, Putra and the rest of your staff for a great stay.",

They went above and beyond for us to make our stay perfect.\nThe villa itself is truly amazing. Anything you could think of is already included. We could not say a bad word at all. Can't wait to come back and stay here for our next trip!\nThank you so much!",

The villa is located in a great place, not in the middle of the crowds of Seminyak, tucked in a corner but 1 minute walk and you're surrounded by shops and restaurants. The staff was great and incredibly friendly, in particularly Kodek. Every morning, she cooked and served us a fresh breakfast directly in our villa. We really enjoyed our stay.\n\nAdditionally, we booked a cooking class through the villa was great - went to the supermarket with the Chef, learned to make easy Balinese spice and dishes that we are excited to try at home. This was a great value (appox. 30$/couple).",

The place was exactly like in photos and we enjoyed the place very much and location was good. Close enough for beach to walk with 4 year old daughter. All the rooms had good air conditioning and own showers and bathrooms. Comfortably fit for 8 adults. Can easily recommend for bigger groups. \n\nHaving all the staff services like in hotel without being in one. We had own cheff service for 2 weeks and he could make dietary foods like glutein free dishes to serve my father. It was like having private restaurant in the villa by your choice and needs.\n\nStaff was very polite and warm hearted. Place was cleaned every day and very comfortably to sleep in good beds. We liked also the possibility to use own car/driver and ready planned trips on the Villa guide. Went for Ubud and South of Bali with easy and relax way by using the possibility of the Villa's transportation for whole day. \n\nAll our requests were met and wishes for services, like massages in the Villa, carried by the Putra and his employees.\n\nWe were thank full to choose this place for us to enjoy my birthday destination. Would recommend it to all.",

Not only is the space so breathtaking, a cozy and sophisticated villa supplanted right in the tropics, but it is located in the heart of Seminyak, close to what became our favorite restaurants, bars, and shops. We were just 15 minutes from the beach and a few steps away from the busiest street in Seminyak, but while in the villa we felt as if we were miles away in the Indonesian jungle. The pool is gorgeous and the space surrounding the villa is lush with greenery and flora. The villa itself is incredibly clean and well taken care of by the staff and the bed was unbelievably comfortable. We cannot understate how friendly and accommodating the entire villa staff was while we were there. They made us amazing Indonesian breakfast every day right in the villa, they were available day and night to meet whatever need, they organized amazing tours with a personal driver in Ubud and Uluwatu at prices that were way, way, below anything offered by third parties, they provided us with a preloaded mobile phone and round-the-clock guidance for our stay. Visitors are often warned against the bugs but the staff were so diligent about prepping the house to repel mosquitos with spray and coils that we lasted 6 days without a single bite! This is easily the most beautiful place we've ever stayed and it was so difficult to leave! Even as we walked around Seminyak we noticed how superior our villa was to others around. Many thanks to amazing Nilesh, Made and Putra- we'll definitely be back!",

Thought we would give them a week of luxury and that's just what we got. The villa was as nice as I expected but what made our stay extra special was Putra and the staff. Can't say enough about all they did to make our vacation stress free. From Thomas picking us up at the airport and driving all 7 of us around Bali, to Mayan and staff preparing tasty meals and making sure we never ran out of wine!, to Putra making sure everything ran smoothly, thank you all for your attentive service.

Nilesh & team were excellent communicators in person and via email & very helpful explaining the area (a local phone was a nice touch). The location is also tucked away enough to be quiet, but close enough to everything to be walkable.",

It is situated in the heart of Seminyak while being very serene. We did not hear a single motor noise during our stay (so far). The property is very well maintained and clean. The decoration and furnishing are kept in tradition of 'Bali style' while paying attention to the modern luxury. We truly appreciate the smallest of  detail of the design being well thought of.  Two minor feedbacks are that the WiFi coverage can be improved around the property and that the second floor living room could use an air conditioning. \n\nSecond - the service is comparable to the highest standard in hospitality industry which is very surprising considering this is not a full service resort but feels like it!  Starting from the get go, we were picked up at the airport, greeted by the property manager and later by the owner. The staffs are all extremely accommodating and friendly. We even had breakfast cooked in the kitchen with the staffs today!, and the villa cleaned twice during the day, and around the clock security guard. We had our laundry done at a very affordable price. The staffs of course is fluent in English and within a phone call away if need be.\n\nOverall, we ultimately seek comfort and service. This Villa is so close in perfection in achieving those. The service is easily 10/10 with virtually no room for improvement, and the Villa itself is an 9/10 with great decor/design and some minor room of improvement. Honestly, this villa overall is an easy 9.5/10. I would definitely recommend this Villa to family and friends. \n",

We could not ask for more. We stayed for 10 nights. The villa was beautiful. Very clean and organized, nicely decorated and had all the amenities we were looking for. We stayed at the Seminyak location. It was very well situated and close to everything. We were very pleased with the location. Made and Coma made sure our vacation was more than perfect. One of the things we most liked was the shower, which was \"outdoor\". We also really enjoyed our rides with Thomas, the driver. He was very nice and took us to great places. We loved everything about this villa. It made our honeymoon the best ever!",

              "text": "6 of my family stayed here for 8 nights  to celebrate my mum's 70th Birthday.\nFrom start to finish the whole experience was fantastic. The Villa is beautiful and in a really great position in the town and a stones throw from the beach. It is so quiet and peaceful you could be in the middle of nowhere.\nNilesh and his staff are wonderful and couldn't do enough for us, even taking us out to organize a cake for my mum's birthday. I would highly encourage you to have Whyan the chef cook for you, his food was amazing and he suggested lots of Indonesian food for us to try, which of course we did. The housekeeping staff do a fabulous job and again nothing was too much trouble, special thanks to  Ryan and Kadek. \nWe also had a couple of days out with Thomas the driver, who suggested places to go and never tired of answering our many questions.\nOne last mention of Putra the manager who was available to us all the time on the mobile phone he gave us to use. He is lovely and went out of his way to ensure our stay was fabulous. He particularly pushed the boat out for mum's birthday, making sure that everything was perfect, even bringing fireworks!!\nEveryone made this a very special time for my mum and our family, thank you so much, I am extremely glad I chose to stay here.\nThe villa is 8 years old and starting to look a little tired around the edges, but Nilesh is on to this and setting some days aside to give it a little TLC, however it's easily fixed and will not distract from your enjoyment.",

The villa is even bigger and more beautiful than the pictures.It was immaculately clean and so well equipped .From the airport pick up to being met at the villa by Nilesh and Putra we were made so welcome. We cannot sing the praises of all the staff enough, every possible need was met with a beautiful smile and many laughs and by the end of the holiday we all felt like one big family. Make sure you eat in the villa as our several breakfasts and dinners were 1st class.We would highly recommend booking villa seriska satu sanur for your next holiday, we can't wait to return.  THANKYOU ",

It was a beautiful 1 double bedroom villa but it very comfortably accommodated 3 of us due to the 2 extra double sofa beds. The surroundings are great, very secluded and great for privacy. \n\nAmazing open plan lay out with characteristic decor, a very generous sized swimming pool and 2 luxurious bathrooms. \n\nThe location in Seminyak was fantastic, close to Seminyak Square and the beach.\nThe staff were amazing and truly added to our experience in Bali. Putra and the team are dedicated, welcoming and will go above and beyond to help you with anything you might require. Our luggage was lost on arrive in Bali and Putra even drove by the airport to check if it had arrived for us, communicating with the airport staff and arranging the collection of our baggage\n. \nWe stayed for 3 nights and wish we had booked for longer. \nWill definitely be back and would highly recommend this amazing villa.\n\nThank you so much for making the start of our trip extra special!",

They helped us arrange a few surf trips and explorations around the island, and gave us great recommendations for places around town. The villa is beautiful and very very comfortable. It's also located in a great part of town with easy access to anything you will need for your stay. It will be hard to leave the gorgeous poolside, but once you're out and about in Sanur, you'll be glad you did. We also enjoyed amazing Indonesian meals prepared by his chef and staff. We loved the food so much we often chose to stay in and eat by the pool instead of go out. It was great! I would love to visit this amazing place again, and would highly recommend it to anyone looking to have a great stay in a Sanur villa. It was especially perfect for our larger group, and everyone was thrilled with the accommodations!",

Traveling with our parents for the 1st time in Bali, the 5 of us stayed at Nilesh's 3 bedrooms villa in Seminyak for 4 nights and we could not have asked for a better place for a relaxing family vacation!\n\nWe were warmly welcomed right from the start when precision driver Thomas picked us at the airport. Then, a formal welcome by the host Nilesh himself, along with villa manager Putra and part of the room service team. After a detailed introduction of the villa, Putra gave us a dedicated cellphone for 24 hour inquiries or assistance. It won't be long before you knew you can trust them with anything. Trust them with your next day travel plan, trust them with your stomach, trust them with your stay. \n\nThe villa is clean, comforting, and with all the amenities needed, most importantly, it has a pool. The neighborhood is quiet and safe, it's only 5 min walk to supermarket/restaurants/ATM, and 10 min to seminyak beach. \n\nWhat made our experience so great was the people (Nilesh, Audrey, Putra, Thomas, Wayan, \"Monster\"... you guys are amazing), so thoughtful, caring and humble. We would recommend this place to nobody but ourselves !",

He's an expert in hospitality, something that was visible by how his entire staff acted as well. Most of the staff have been with Nilesh for many years and provided a more luxurious service than many 5 star hotels. The villa is very close to the main street of Sanur, yet you don't hear any noise at all. You can relax at the pool with your family. The beds are very comfortable and the bathrooms are spacious and simply fantastic. We had an excellent stay and would like to be back!",

We were a group of four friends who were traveling around Indonesia and had the pleasure of staying for several nights at Villa Seriska (really, we wish it could have been several weeks). Putra and the rest of the staff are so helpful in making your stay effortless - they made it easy to get meals, do laundry, hire a driver, and plan itineraries. You can easily have a group of six or more people here - the rooms are beautiful, bedding is nice, and bathrooms are luxurious.\n\nNote that the neighborhood is more laid back and quiet than some other parts of Bali, so not the best place to stay if you're hoping to go to big nightclubs or the like. Sanur is more laid back, with an older crowd, with good restaurants.\n\nHighly recommend Villa Seriska!",

Between Thomas (driver), Putra (villa manager) and the lovely staff who clean the villa daily and are around to help with whatever we needed, we were in the lap of luxury for the week we stayed at Villa Seriska. Sanur is a quiet, family-friendly area and we hadn't stayed there before but will certainly be going back because of its pristine beach and variety of restaurants. Apart from going on a few trips out of the villa to places like Ubud and Uluwatu, we spent most of our time relaxing by the luxurious pool and enjoying home-cooked meals by the villa chef! Definitely will be returning to this wonderful villa, for both the setting and the quality of service on offer.",

I definitely recommend arranging for Putra to book you an in-room massage - massage was really good (not amazing) but for 150,000 IDR you can't complain!!\n\nBreakfast was good value ($8USD for fruit, delicious cooked breakfast, and juice).\n\nOne thing I would say is don't bother booking a driver for short distances as it is cheaper to taxi (Putra drove us from Seminyak -> Kuta for $15USD (about 200,000 IDR) but a Bluebird taxi will get you there for under 50,000).",

              "text": "I was lucky enough to spend 4 fantastic nights at Villa Seriska Dua in Sanur where the staff are extremely friendy, helpful and willing to cater to all of your needs. However most of the time you don't know that they are there. Everything in the villa was superb from the comfort of the beds and the fully equipped kitchen down to the the beautiful, natural, essential oil products in the bathroom. The outdoor dining area was perfect for enjoying dinner in the cool of the evening and the abundence of sun lounges by the pool ensure you can have a place to laze in the sun or in the shade all day long. I practice yoga and this was the perfect place for this as there were so many great places to practice. The garden is quiet and peaceful and a great place to meditate. Evenings were lovely at the villa. The on site chef can cook up any meal you request and the staff take extra measures to ensure that the bedrooms are free of mosquitos for a great nights sleep. Nelish and Audry are wonderful hosts and were there to greet us when we arrived and there to say goodbye when we left. I highly reccommend Villa Seriska Dua for couples who want a luxurious private retreat or families wanting an amazing stress free holiday.",

Nilesh and the villa staff where very welcoming and ensured that we had everything that we needed. It was fantastic to have our own chef to make our dinners and breakfasts especially having small children. It meant that we could relax and enjoy the company of the rest of the family whilst our children played. I would highly recommend having the chef Wayan make you a Indonesian banquet as well as a seafood BBQ, both were absolutely delicious! We have been to Bali 4 times previously but this was our first trip to Sanur and it is now our favorite destination in Bali! It is a great place for a relaxing family holiday due to the safe and clean beach, the multitude of great restaurants within a close distance as well as the footpaths being well maintained and wide for safe passage for little ones walking or in prams. The villa is located well within Sanur being in close walking distance to the beach and the main road which both have great places to eat. Taxi's are also cheap and easy to come by if you want to travel further afield. Nilesh was very easy to communicate with and was very prompt in replying to emails. I look forward to coming again next year for some more pampering, relaxation and delicious food.",

              "text": "We stayed with Villa Seriska in Sanur Bali in June 2015. We were 6 persons staying for four nights. We were picked up in Ubud by the Villa Seriska driver and taken straight to the villa. We have stayed a few different places in Bali, but this villa is really the most impressing place. Beautifully Bali designed house, it's spacious, luxurious and private at the same time. With one common area and several different bed rooms situated in different houses, it's ideal for a large family or a group of friends. We loved the huge pool and the lounge area - you don't really need to leave the house:) But if you do, the location is very good close to the Sanur main street with plenty of shopping, food and drink options. There is also a \"secret\" passage through a market place that will take you to Sanur beach in less than 5 minutes. I personally prefer Semaniyak beach other Sanur as it allows for surfing, but Sanur beach is perfect for families especially with younger kids (like us). The Villa Seriska staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. There is a cook pretty much on call 24/7  but we would suggest that you agree with him from the very start what you expect and need. That will make it easier for them to plan and give you some more private time if that's what you want. PS. Try the Beef Rendang - it's incredible! The staff will help organize scooters and also arranged a baby cot for our daugther. We loved the place and would definitely recommend it to anybody looking for this kind of venue in Sanur!",

Excellent service, from the pick-up\nat the airport to the meals cooked by our own private chef. Gorgeous villa, \nwith such helpful owner and staff who went out of their way to show us\naround and recommend restaurants and trips to make our visit as \nperfect as possible. The villa is in a great spot, just a short walk to the beach\nand also the main street of Sanur with lovely restaurants and shops. \nAs well as the 5 star service we received, the villa has a nice large pool for\nthe children to play in, as well as a pavillion to lounge on which is where\nwe spent a lot of time! The staff keep the villa in excellent, clean condition\nand the atmosphere is perfect for spending a lazy day by the pool - not to\nmention fast wifi coverage everywhere! If you're looking for a tranquil, \nluxurious environment with first-class service, Villa Seriska is the place!",

Nilesh then handed us over to the laid back but highly efficient property manager Putra who showed us around this 4 bedroom villa and gave us the house mobile with the numbers of all those we may need during our stay or for emergencies. Wayan prepared food for us on numerous occasions including all breakfasts and any requests we may have and shopped for the food too. They all made us feel welcome and couldn't do enough for us. Kadek and Rian were continually making the place look beautiful and took great delight in the company of our small grandchildren.\nAll the rooms are lovely, master bedroom had the bathroom shower open to the sky something I will sorely miss. Beautiful pool. The whole area has security staff for this little group of villas. Key to go through the magic door to the market and onto the beach just a minute of two from the pool.\nMy thanks to them all and book with complete confidence here to have a fabulous stay.

After our visit, I would definitely recommend Villa Seriska to any family looking for a spacious private villa and first class service. The staff were so helpful and we always felt safe with our two young ones playing around the villa - they even installed a pool fence around the large pool! Also a relaxing time for the adults - as a large family we spent a lot of time hanging out at the villa and wandering around Sanur which we love, although the driver was available for us if we wanted to take a longer trip. We also met Nilesh, the owner, and Putra, the villa manager, who were helpful is suggesting places we could go or accommodating our needs. For any travellers looking to take a trip to Bali, we would definitely recommend Villa Seriska as a clean, private and luxurious accomodation. Definitely staying with them next time we come to Bali!",

I wonder if a sixth is available? \nWhat can be said about the little bit of paradise that is the Villa Seriska, that isn\u2019t obvious from the pictures, video and description that the affable owner  Nilesh provides on the Villa website and the websites of other sites, such as HomeAway? The peace and tranquillity promised is apparent from the moment we as a family opened the door to this beautiful haven; the comfort of the rooms, furniture and facilities is matched by their cleanliness. The promises made on the websites are delivered \u2026 and then some! The Villa Seriska website assures prospective guests a luxurious \u201chome from home\u201d and this is amply provided, with all the little touches that make a stay at the Villa a complete joy.\nNo, the one thing that cannot be conveyed from the portrayal in the pictures and video, is the quality of the staff. Their friendly, thorough, yet unobtrusive hard work ensures that a stay at Villa Seriska rises from a perfectly comfortable and relaxing vacation to a warm and welcoming one. My family and I, cannot thank, Wayan, Kadek, Rian, Thomas, Uni and Putra enough. Whether it was the wonderful cooking, the driving, or the general help and organising, these were always done to the highest standards, and always with a smile. It is a long way from the UK to Bali, but if we the Williams family have a chance in the future to return, there is only one place that we would come back to \u2013 Villa Seriska. Thank you all. \nDiolch yn fawr i chi gyd am wyliau rhagorol!",

The villa is very spacious and has a lovely design with a large pool deck and garden. Villa is also open-plan so you can also drift from the bedroom to the pool areas very easily and is perfect for a larger group. Staff were very friendly and always smiling, managing to accomodate our every need! We spent a fair amount of time relaxing by the pool but also took a few trips to Ubud and did some other activities, luckily we had a good tour guide and driver with Thomas, who was very patient showing us around as for some of us this was our first trip to Bali. Villa was clean, quiet and well-maintained - we were even given a villa mobile phone so we could contact the helpful manager Putra! Overall we felt very well taken care of staying at Villa Seriska, we also met Nilesh, the owner, personally - this made us feel more at home and anything we needed was provided for us, also made us feel it was a better choice to chose a villa over a hotel because of the personal level of service! Must also mention the food was great, we actually ended up eating at the villa most nights because chef Wayan produces restaurant-quality food, both Asian and Western so we had a great choice for those who weren't too comfortable with Asian food.  Overall, we spent a wonderful week being pampered at Villa Seriska and would highly recommend to anyone visiting Bali - we ourselves are already planning a return trip ASAP! ",

We searched the Internet for any last minute availability for one night as we were unsure how long the airport closure would last, and were pleased to find Villa Seriska Dua was available. We had previously stayed at Villa Seriska Satu also in Sanur and had a wonderful stay there and were reassured that the standard would be good. When we arrived at the villa we were delighted with the property and it will be a difficult decision in future choosing which property to stay at. Although Seriska 2 is not so close to the beach it is also a very stylish villa and has a slightly larger garden. Facilities at Seriska Dua are first class and the staff are outstanding, nothing is too much trouble. Both properties can be highly recommend whether for a group of family or friends or for couples seeking a spacious and romantic luxury hideaway.",

              "text": "The proprietor of Villa Seriska - there are now 2 villas - pays attention to detail and listens to his customers. A customer told him that he needed deck-beds for all the guests. The villa sleeps 8, and there are 8 deck-beds by the pool. His aim is to please his customers, and many of them (like us) keep coming back for more. We stayed in Villa Seriska 2 this time around. It has 4 bedrooms, all with ensuite bathrooms. While its location in Sanur is a bit of a walk to the main strip (about 15 minutes perhaps), they had bicycles and a car and driver on standby if we needed to use them. The main strip has a supermarket so you can get your supplies. There is also good shopping and some great restaurants serving food from international and local menus. Try Massimo for Italian and Cafe Batujimbar for local fare. But the service staff at the villa serve up a fabulous barbecue (seafood, meat, just ask) in the gazebo by the pool. We had that on two nights of our stay. Yum. Rooms and the villa were well cleaned everyday. We also had daily massages by the pool - you can get the phone number from the villa staff. The masseusses come en masse and massage everyone all together. If you want a hassle-free, chill holiday, this is the way to go.",

Putra who looked after myself and my family was absolutely beautiful and was superb in his nature & being so helpful. \n\nThe housekeepers were pure gems. \n\nWe did visit the Orphanage which Villa Seriska supports to play with the children. \n\nThis was truly blessed. \n\nI did leave them a generous gesture so I do hope this can take them a little further with the great work they do for those cute little angels. The villa is spacious, the outside shower is bliss. It's clean, aircon is strong and in every room. The pool is the perfect size. \n\nThe villa was absolutely perfect. There is nothing I would change. I will definitely visit again.\n\nAngelique Torcasio\n\nMelbourne Australia",

Perfect location for boutique shopping, eating, Bali deli for supplies. Beach 15 minutes walk away but plenty of transport. Organised a great deal to Nusa Lembongen and delivered our extra luggage to Sanur on our return. Absolutely recommend this place.",

              "text": "It seems there are two villa seriskas (satu and dua). I stayed at the single storey one in Sanur. It was okay, but nothing fantastic. The staff were unobtrusive as is apparently the policy, but we found the service pretty cold, as was the pool. The showers were appalling, the water just trickled out and the open air bathrooms meant the kids and ourselves had no escape from mosquitoes at all. There is simply no way to stop them coming in through the open air bathrooms, and they are attracted to all the water surrounding the bath tubs I think. We were all covered in bites despite layering in aeroguard and putting coils everywhere. Beware that the driver at your service is a complete rip off. They charged us $60 US for what ended up being half a day. For that price we could have caught taxis all over the island. Its daylight robbery to pay that much on an island where transport is famously cheap. Luckily we only made the mistake once. Its easy enough to walk to the corner and grab transport. We also did not get access to the washing machine mentioned either, although laundry service was cheap enough. The villas location is great and handy access to the beach, but there are nicer villas around now that we have been there and looked around. Many people mention Nilesh in their review and as he was not there when we were there, maybe this had something to do with our average stay. Sanur is beautiful and we will no doubt go back, but not to this villa.",

I am sorry that you found them to be cold. This is the opposite to the comments from most of our other guests - as you will see from the other guest reviews. \r\n\r\nWith regard to the swimming pool, like all other pools in Bali, it is not heated. However, it is in direct sunlight most of the day and with the tropical temperatures, our other guests have not had a problem even swimming in the evenings.\r\n\r\nI was surprised by your comment about our showers as we have never had a problem with this at this villa. I checked with my staff and believe that you experience low pressure when once they were filling up the pool at the same time \u2026 this was explained to a member of your group. \r\n\r\nWe do have two en-suite semi-open Balinese style bathrooms at this villa. Both these bathrooms have solid doors to the bedrooms. Our other guests have not had a problem with mosquitoes, but i will check and address this when i return to Bali in two days time.\r\n\r\nWe have a washing machine for guest use near the kitchen area. I am sorry if this was not shown to you during your stay.\r\n\r\nThe daily charge (8 hours) for our private minivan to accommodated your group of 8 guests, including fuel and driver/guide, is USD 60. This is the standard charge in Bali for this size of vehicle. We inform guests in advance of our charges. Some private operators may charge less but in many cases will charge extra for fuel. I understand that you decided to use our minivan for approx. 6 hours for your shopping and lunch trip to Seminyak. For information, two return taxis (to accommodate 8 people) would cost approx. USD 44 from Sanur to Seminyak, excluding side trips for shopping. \r\n\r\nI am sorry that part of our service did not meet your expectation, but i am glad that you liked our villa location and Sanur.",

The pool was a good size for the villa.\n\nAll of the staff were very friendly and helpful, daily breakfast was made for us along with lunch one day, and our airport transferred were included which is always handy when you arrive!\n\nI would have no hesitation recommending this villa, and will definitely have it on my list to visit again on my next trip.",

The villa was big and spacious, the pool was always kept warm enough, and the staff were attentive and hospitable. \n\nHowever, there were several power trips on the upper floors of the villa for the first two days, which forced my friends and I (all 7 of us) to eventually move the beds to the master room on the first floor so that we could sleep. We were already warned about the power tripping issues from overcharging of cellphones, so we had consciously limited our charging of phones to one at a time, or sometimes none at all, but this didn't help the situation. We were a bit upset that the staff kept telling us to not charge our phones to fix the situation despite the fact that we kept insisting that we were not doing so. In the end, the owner of the villa got an electrician to fix the situation on the afternoon of day 2 (which worked but was, of course, rather late) and did not charge us for the extra bed we got, but we couldn't help but feel that this was too little too late. \n\nThere was also a persistent wifi problem which caused us to be unable to connect on most times we tried, causing some of us to throw in the towel and buy local 3G SIM cards to contact our loved ones. \n\nOverall, quite a pity as the villa was really great in all other respects.",

It was a wonderful villa, run by a hospitable and attentive staff, managed by a charming couple, and gave us a welcome respite from the busyness of our lives back home (which we really never wanted to return to during our lovely holiday!). Arriving at the villa, we were greeted by Nilesh and Audrey, who were very accommodating, showing us around the place, helping us get our bearings, and giving us great recommendations for our stay. The rooms were well-designed, clean, and homely. The bathrooms were incredible, and I swear that's not hyperbole (you have to see it to believe it - the bathtubs themselves are submerged in a gorgeous pond, replete with fish and flora). The villa staff were friendly and made us feel as if we were at a new home. Honestly did not want to leave, and am gutted that I'm writing this review in Hong Kong, and not in Villa Seriska in Bali!",

It's only few mins walk to beach, restaurants, spas and shops so finding something to keep you entertained is never a problem. \n\nThe location of the villa is very convenient, however the minute you enter the compound you feel at peace with tranquil water features blocking out any outside noise. The villa is very private with high surrounding fence and grounds are lush and well maintained. The villa itself was tastefully furnished and we'll kept. The moment you walk in to this luxury villa, you will absolutely fall in love with it, the sounds of the water feature, stunning private pool, shaded sun loungers, fish pond, all of these provide a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere. \nThe rooms of the villa are gorgeous, the decor was beautiful and tasteful. All rooms have both fan and air-conditioning . Every room is fully equipped, and we loved having all the light options. Also whole villa it's wireless covered.\n\nAll the staffs in villa are  difentily provided world class hospitality.\nThey are very attentive and willing to handle any request you may have. The room is always clean when you return, there always fresh towel available, and also the staff will put out mosquito coils for the outdoor bathroom areas and close the sleeping area. You really couldn't ask more! One last thing to mention, villa has 24hrs security guard, you will fell very safe here!\n\nI have to say villa seriska it's a fictitious land of peace. I would highly recommend villa seriska to other travellers.",

And it is huge! and super clean :) we had an unexpected guest with us for the trip and the people of villa were accommodating of that fact :) so we had a pleasant & peaceful stay. The location of this villa is very good with all the eateries around us. A very good Indian restaurant - Queen was also very close, so it was very convenient with our parents :) the beach was also very close. I would recommend this place to everyone who wants to have a peaceful time in seminyak!",

My kids love you guys too. My younger son celebrated his 5th birthday on our last night and the first person whom he gave the cake was his favorite \"Uncle Thomas\" ! :) My Eldest son's favourite is no other than Chef Wayan, who will accommodate his ice-cream and spaghetti requests any time any day. Also not forgetting the gals who made our rooms so we come back to a clean place to rest in. Thank you all very much and we will not hesitate to come again!",

It was a really good sized pool. She spent hours rowing her little float boat in it.\n\nThe villa itself was tastefully furnished and well kept. There's a turndown service every night and the staff would put on the mosquito coils and repellents around the villa.\u00a0\n\nThe staff are really nice. Special mention to Putra who welcomed us on our first day and gave us a lot of info of the area. Really approacable and will always be there when you need anything. The villa provides a handphone so if you need anything (in-villa spa, in-villa meals, tours) you can just contact the staff. Putra arranged our delicious in-villa lunch and also my super relaxing in-villa spa.\n\nLocation wise, can't get any better.. lots of eateries nearby. Close to main road yet quiet and private. Short taxi ride to the beach.\u00a0\n\nIn short, we felt like royalty here. Thanks to Nilesh and his wonderful staff.",

The villa was very clean and tidy and the location was very good. The main thing that shone was the level of service with the staff being so wonderful. They are so friendly and nothing is a bother. The staff here are the best I have had at any villa stay in Bali. The owner met us on the morning of our second day and is a lovely person. The boys fell in love with the owners dog which is beautiful and always happy for a friendly pat. \nI was ill for part of my stay due to a poor eating choice of my own and the staff were so help full and genuinely concerned and often offered to help in any way. \nThe villa here is one of the quietest I have stayed at in bali up a private no thru street with no road noise\nI can not recommend more highly this villa and its a perfect spot to base yourself and a great place for family's with such wonderful service why would you go past it?\n(If you have small children do note the pool is not fenced)",

We were in 2 families and we were very pleased with the amenities, accomodation and service. The villa is beautiful and is in an excellent location, very close to the beach, restaurants and shops. Nilesh, the owner, did an amazing job from the time we inquired about the villa (about 4 minths prior to our trip) until the day we checked out. We would definitely return if our travels take us to Bali again, and recommend to anyone looking for an amazing experience.\nNilesh, thank you very much for providing an excellent service. Your house is beautiful and it was a pleasure meeting you.\nGisele S.",

It was a great change of pace for us.  Having similar amenities to a luxury hotel yet with the added living space was of great benefit for a family of five.\n\nNilesh has provided top notch service in making his customers feel welcome. His staff including Putra, Made, Manik, Thomas, and others made sure all of our needs were met...especially with our last minute requests!\n\nThe location is convenient to restaurants, shops, and spas so finding something to keep you entertained is never a problem.  A driver is available for day trips.  We were able to visit areas north of Seminyak and down towards the southern part of the island as well.  It is well worth having a driver available for these day excursions.  Each driver was able to show us highlights at each stop and Putra even was gracious enough to act as a tour guide at one of the temples for us.\n\nIf you are considering to stay at a Villa, I would not hesitate to consider contacting Nilesh at Villa Seriska.  His staff is remarkable and they will help make your stay a memorable one.",

              "text": "I visited Bali last week along with my wife and friends. We had booked the three bedroom villa Seriska Satu in Seminyak. From the moment we stepped inside the villa until the moment we left for the airport, the stay was truly amazing. Everything is perfect in the villa. The beds are very comfortable and the sleep quality is very good. The whole villa is very tastefully designed and is very functional as well. The pool area is the highlight of the villa and you can spend your whole day just lazying around. The villa is perfect for big groups travelling together.\n\nJust one small suggestion- there should be a trash can in the pool area. Apart from that, everything is spot on.",

Villa located just few minutes to Sauna beach by bike,and it had just provided some bikes.Rooms size are great,especially the master room.The rooms were all clean and made us comfortable.There were skylights inside the bathroom. We could ask the chef cooking Real Indonesian BBQ to the villa chat around the swimming pool and stars at night.Food was perfect!That was so warm to enjoy family happiness.Otherwise,we could ask the driver to take us to any attractions.And the driver was patience to help us travel arrangements, and provides a lot of good advice. Villa located just few minutes to Sauna beach by bike,and it had just provided some bikes.At last,all the staff are very polite and helpful.We all love the villa.we will revisit next time for a longer period and recommend to friends.",

              "text": "Villa Seriska (www.seriska.com) is a two story (complete with safety gates), three bedroom villa in the heart of Seminyak Beach. The villas has a small private pool, complete with a pool fence (a big safety bonus for this mom). When I began looking at villas these safety fences were available, but there was always an extra charge (around $25usd per day). Villa Seriska provided both of these at no extra charge.  They were both good quality and in proper working order.\n\nThe location of the villa is on the end of a quite cup-de-sac that is an easy walk (even with small children) to great food, shopping, and most importantly to a mom-a grocery store, pharmacy, and liquor store. My husband and I were able to run on the sidewalks every day, never running down a busy or unsafe street.  It is a very easy 15 minute walk to the beach, again, down safe streets. Also, there is the option of cabs or the car that can be rented from the villa.\n\nThomas is the driver we were able to hire through the villa. He was with us from the time we collected our bags at the airport until he dropped us off to come home. We were able to get a medium size van, complete with car seats for both boys, for a very reasonable rate. Thomas met us at the airport, helped us with our bags, and helped plan the tours we wanted to see. He was very knowledgable about travel time to certain destinations as well as the best time to go. Thomas also took us to an amazing restaurant on the beach where we had a great meal while watching the sun go down. An added bonus you could watch the planes land at the airport across the water, so my older son was sitting on the beach, watching boats and airplanes! It was a perfect evening for a three-year-old boy.\n\nThomas was only the beginning of the great staff provided by Villa Seriska. We were also provided with a chef, daily housekeeping, and a villa manager. We had breakfast in the villa every morning (not having to get everyone dressed and out the door for breakfast-win). The selection of food was wonderful and everything was complemented with fresh fruit and wonderful Indonisean coffee. The staff entertained my older son while I fed the baby, showing him how to feed the fish in the pond and even letting him help scramble eggs. What a great stress-free way to start the day. We also had dinner one night in the villa. Because it was a special occasion, a family birthday, I asked if we could have dinner prepared for my son first and ours after he was put to bed. The staff had no problem accommodating this request. They also cooked on a grill outside and in another villa, so as not to make too much noise while I was getting the boys to bed. The staff set up a great Balinese BBQ. My only regret is that we did not dine-in more.\n\nI would be remise if I did not mention the villa owner, Nelish. He was hands on throughout our stay, stopping by to check on us and providing some great restaurant recommendations. His dog, Monster, was a big hit with everyone on the trip as well. We also had a slight medical concern during our stay and without question Nelish dropped everything and drove me to the emergency room.",

              "text": "I rarely write a review on Trip Advisor although I consider my wife and I to be travelers who appreciate local culture, great food, exceptional service and to have a high expectation of enjoyment once we have planned our trip.\n\nThis particular vacation to Bali was planned by my Son and his Wife who live in Bangkok.  As the travel to BKK is such an effort from the States we were happy to have a side trip with their family and we were quite intrigued regarding Bali.  To get to my point, I do not intend to go into all the great things about Bali as it is a wonderful experience that we enjoyed so very much.\n\nHowever, the best part of the trip was staying at Villa Seriska!  Like everyone else the key factors in choosing Villa Seriska were the quality reputation and location.  While these two factors were A+ in my opinion, the real story is the staff.  We took full advantage of their services of a driver and meal preparation for us.  We started every morning with a wonderful breakfast prepared for us (I recommend the Indonesian breakfast) which was an event in itself.  The food was fresh and expertly prepared and the Chef even let my three year-old Grandson lend a hand.  My family surprised me one night with a fantastic dinner prepared by the staff for my Birthday and I only regret we didn't have other evening meals prepared for us as it was the best meal on the trip.\n\nI also have to comment on the driver provided for us for a nominal charge.  Thomas turned out to be an outstanding tour guide who took us to temples, rice terraces, a coffee plantation, etc., that made our trip perfect.\n\nIn closing I can only say I can't more highly recommend Villa Seriska.  Without a doubt it was the best lodging experience i possibly haveever enjoyed.I truly wish we could have them as our hosts wherever we travel as the best part of our trip to Bali was Nilesh and his wonderful staff!",

Our favourite was of course the private pool! We could spend hours just wading around the pool and chatting with our families. Room service was always punctual. We never had to deal with unkept bedsheets or wet towels. Everything is always promptly changed and well maintained. Thank you for giving us such previous memories to hold on to for the rest of our lives. Oh yes! Thanks for all the wonderful advice and tips on places to eat and shop. \n\nP.S.

              "text": "Villa Seriska Satu is a gorgeous private villa in the heart of Sanur. It is a short (2min) stroll to the beach via a private alley and then through the market. Or, if you want shopping then walk 50 metres in the other direction and you're on the main shopping/restaurant/tourist street. The minute you enter the compound you feel at peace with tranquil water features blocking out any outside noise. The pool is as amazing as the villa. We had 8 adults and 2 children staying and we all had plenty of space. This villa was definitely the highlight of our two week stay in Bali.\n\nThe staff are helpful and will do anything to assist you.\n\nWe would have given this villa a 5 out of 5 rating but unfortunately the food, whilst good, was always served later than the agreed times in the mornings. This was a bit annoying when we wanted to get out and do stuff early. However, it must have been hard for the chef catering with a larger party than normal. I think we could have managed the time problem by calling the manager to sort it out but we were on holiday and couldn't be bothered.",

              "text": "First let me say, this review is only to serve to as a warning as we were not the right fit for the type of people that should stay here. \n\nThe villa itself is very nice looking. The stay itself was...awkward.\n\n-When we arrived the pool lounge chairs were set up with towels nicely rolled and placed on each one with a few in the kitchen. That was the last time we saw those towels. After they were used and placed in the bin to be replaced, they were never to be seen again. After the first swim, we had to go out of the villa to the garage in the alley and seek someone to bring us towels. We couldn't find anyone so we had to call the manager to ask for someone to bring them to us. \n-The villas do not have a reception/management office or area. So if you need anything while you are there, you have to call the manager's cell and then he has to send someone to your villa. Unfortunately, when they arrive they are not told what your request was, so then you have to explain to them and wait again for them to bring you whatever you need. Just a silly waste of time, in my opinion.\n-You can order breakfast through the villa, but there are only two options: American and Indonesian set meals. The website/reviews said you only have to pay for ingredients but the price was a set $10usd per person, which to me seems like more than the cost of the ingredients based on the amount of food they provide. You have to order 24 hours in advance, which is hard when you arrive at 2pm for check in and want breakfast for the next day. Thus, we had no choice but to have all Indonesian breakfasts. We set the time for 6am as the whole group was getting ready to leave for early tour. The chef comes into your villa (without knocking, using their own key) and makes the breakfast in your kitchen. It was VERY awkward as they did not tell us they were there and it was a villa of three late 20s females. It was unnerving to wake up and find someone in your villa that you did not let in.\n-The serving of the breakfast itself was very awkward.  The chef waited for 45 minutes for us to come down and sit at the table to be served (like children?). We told the chef it was okay to just put the food on the table when it was ready, as we were all rushing to get ready to leave for a morning tour and wanted to eat as we were up and about. He just stood there and waited, serving the fruit first. He waitied for us to finish the fruit, so he could bring out the main-- did not say this, just stood and watched, so we had to assume that's what it was. It was very, very awkward trying to explain to him that he didn't need to stand there and wait for us to finish each item before bringing the next. He didn't understand at all, but finally told us he had to leave to go fix breakfast for another villa (thank goodness). The food was average at best - we really love Indonesian food but this was quite bland. Maybe he thought he was doing us a favor?\n-The master bedroom is downstairs with two doors - one going to the bathroom which is exposed to the out doors and one to the kitchen. Only one of those doors can be locked from inside the room.  So, the main bedroom can be accessed from the exterior villa area, which is absolutely terrifying for a young woman staying in the downstairs room alone. Eventually I just stayed upstairs with the rest of the guests because I could not bear to be down there with no safety lock.\n\nThe villa is decent, but definitely not for us. If you do not expect privacy within the villa and enjoy being watched and waited on in that way, this is absolutely the right choice for you.",

Upon request, a further 3 pool towels were placed in the villa. You are correct that, as a private villa, we do not have a reception desk. Therefore, we give our guests a local mobile phone so they can contact us at any time. We also have staff inside our villa compound 24 hours a day: Housekeeping staff from 7am to 7pm and security staff from 5pm to 7am. \r\n\r\nWe offer the services of a chef within our rates for all our direct bookings. The chef will make breakfast, lunch or dinner, as required, and our guests only pay for the ingredients used. We request at least 12 hours (ideally 24 hours) notice for food order so our chef can purchase fresh ingredients. Unless requested not to do so, the chef and serving staff enter the kitchen/dining room area about 30 minutes before the requested time for breakfast in order to make the necessary preparations. In your case they arrived at 5.30am for your breakfast request at 6am. We are sorry if there was any miscommunication regarding this matter. \r\n\r\nNormally our guests like to have their breakfast hot and freshly prepared, so the main course is prepared when our guests are having their fruits and tea/coffee. We are sorry that our staff misunderstood your request to prepare all the food as soon as possible and leave the villa. By the way, we have a sign on the main door which the guests can use if they require privacy. If this sign is placed on the door, our staff will not enter the villa.\r\n\r\nAs you know, your booking was made via an agent. Due to the discount rate offered, no breakfast or chef service was included in the rate. This was explained to you on arrival and therefore the breakfast was chargeable at US$ 10 per adult.\r\n\r\nAll the doors to the master bedroom have a lock. There is a lock on the master bathroom door, but unfortunately the key was not in the lock as our guests do not normally lock this door to the bathroom from the inside. If you had requested that this door should be locked, we would have been happy to give you the key.\r\n\r\nWe are glad that you liked our villa but we are sorry that some aspects of our service were not to your liking. Our staff do their very best to provide a high quality, personalised service to all our guests as confirmed in the other guest reviews.",

              "text": "This was the first time our family of 4 and my mom travelled to Bali and we picked Villa Seriska Dua because of the great reviews from Tripadvisor.  \n\nThe villa is located at end of a quiet cul-de-sac and about 5 minutes walk to the edge of the hustle and bustle of Seminyak.  If you wish do not wish to walk, there are plenty of taxis on the streets and are very inexpensive.\n\nThe villa is very private with high surrounding fence/wall and the grounds are lush and well maintained.  The sounds of the water features and fish in the pond provide a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere. The pool is small but offers cool relief during the day when it is quite hot and humid. \n\nThe inside of the villa is clean and tidy.   The kitchen provided the essentials if you prefer to prepare some meals yourself and we had the Chef prepare for us a few delicious meals and we were always stuffed!  The bedrooms were well appointed and the mattresses were very comfortable.  The master bathroom had a fantastic outdoor shower.  \n\nThe best thing about our stay is that we loved the staff.   What a wonderful way for our family to spend our holiday and for the Seriska team to expose us to the culture on our first visit to Bali. It was so memorable and worry free. Thank you so much to Putra, Made, Thomas, Niluh, Wayan, Manik and Nilesh for providing us with first rate personalized service. \n\nWe look forward to returning back to Bali in the very near future.",

The property is beautifully and lovingly maintained and the listing description and photos are entirely accurate.  The staff are a delight and the owner provided excellent customer service.  We would definitey recommend this property to others and have already done so.  \nWe particualry enjoy the area of Sanur and the property location as it was quiet, yet the beach, restuarants, shops were in easy walking distance.  We would recommend that guests enjoy what Sanur has to offer and our three pre-teen children enjoyed paddling and sailing in the lagoon reef.  A family highlight was going to Surf School for 5 days and visiting the Elephant Park.\nYou will not be disappointed in choosing this stunning villa and all it has to offer.",

It was just like we saw it before on the webpages!\nThe island is also very nice, people are  very friendly. The staff did an excellent job, serving us very kindly. We used the service of Thomas, for driving us around the island. This was a very good choice, he knew his way and the interesting places to go to.  we can recommend this domicil for families, but also for couples without children. We hope we come back some time in the future.",

              "text": "First and foremost, I would like to thank Nilesh (villa owner) and his wonderful team of staff for making our stay at Seriska so wonderful. We simply love the privacy and the personal service and attention given by them. We have our very own private chef (Made) who served us a hearty American breakfast and a driver (Thomas) to take us around. Putra (Villa manager) is very friendly, speaks good English and very accommodating to all our requests. Felt like 5 pampered princesses! A thick manual painstakingly prepared by Nilesh provides useful guide on how to spend your holiday in Bali. The 3 bedroom villa is close to the hustle and bustle of Seminyak town but the minute you entered the villa, it is so calm and peaceful. The only sound we hear is the crowing rooster! The villa is beautifully decorated with Balinese statues and art. The villa is spacious and very open where you could see beautiful landscapes surrounding the villa from the living to the dining to the kitchen area. The master bedroom on the ground floor overlooks the private swimming pool. For those of you who can\u2019t live without the internet, free WIFI is available and large flat TV screen for entertainment. If you like to shop and dine, shops and restaurants are within walking distance.We have taken lots of photos during our stay at the villa and all my friends in Facebook are very impressed. We highly recommend this wonderful villa if you are planning a holiday to Bali.",

The villa is beautifully decorated and has everything you need for a relaxing stay including the beautiful swimming pool. The location is great as well as Seminyak Beach and the shops & restaurants are not far away at all but the villa itself is very peaceful. The staff were amazing and made me feel right at home from the very minute I arrived at Bali airport where Thomas was there to collect me. The manager Putra is extremely friendly and helpful and nothing was too much for him and his team. His English is very good as well. The rest of the staff were also friendly & helpful and their cooking was amazing. I\u2019ve had a fantastic time seeing Bali and I also fulfilled a lifelong dream to swim with dolphins with Bali Dolphins in Serangan. It was fabulous! I have no hesitation in recommending Bali to my friends & colleagues and most certainly will recommend Villa Seriska to make the stay that much extra special. I hope to return myself one day. Many thanks to Nilesh & his team. Tina, Windsor, UK.",

They had a made-to-order breakfast ready daily, kept the villa spic and span, and will drive you all over the island. Their recommendations,re, sights, restaurants, shops were also right on the money. The location is about a kilometer from the beach, steps from Seminyak's main drag, on a quiet gang (alley), next to Bali Deli. Thank you, maraming salamat, Tarima Kasi, samsama!!!",

From the moment we arrived the staff were so helpful & accommodating yet were extremely discreet throughout our stay. The villa was beautiful and the pool area was gorgeous. The location was very peaceful with great restaurants only a short walk and only $4 taxi into the heart of Kuta. If you'd rather stay in the talented staff can cater mouthwatering dinners that would rival some restaurants. As you can see we had a wonderful time and would highly recommend a stay at Seriska.",

I thought staying at 5* hotels were good, but nothing compares to what myself and my family (7) have just experienced.\nFrom the moment we were collected from the airport by Thomas, we could not have been treated any better. The staff at the villa are to be congratulated on providing a service second to none. Nothing was too much trouble, always smiling and willing to help make the holiday one to treasure.\nMost of my family had never been to Bali, and were slightly apprehensive of what to expect, however form day one they were made to feel at ease and enjoyed every minute.\nWe will definately be booking again for next year, (can't wait)...\nThanks once again to Nilesh and the staff at Villa Seriska.\nAlbie",

The Villa itself is just beautiful. The Pool and outside area is perfect for relaxing around , and the rooms are very comfortable and clean.There is ample cooling including fans.\nThe staff were very helpful and accommodating. We were greeted each day with a spectacular breakfast. We were not bothered by the staff at all. We would return from our daily outings to find the villa clean and beds turned down for us all. The staff we able to assist with any concerns or help we needed including advice, laundry, fresh water and the list goes on. One evening we required a babysitter, and it was organized with in minutes. A lovely well spoken lady called Alicia. Our daughter ( who is ) loved her.\nThe Villa's are the perfect location in Seminyak. It is at the end of a quiet lane, close to lovely restaurants, day spa's and of course the famous Bali Delhi, for all essentials.\nAs a Virgin Blue employee I was very impressed with this Villa and will definately return with my family and friends, and of course would recommend to my many customers.\nA big thanks to Nilesh and his team, and of course Monster the children entertainer!  We look forward to returning to Seriska!",

              "text": "We stayed at the Villa Seriska in Sanur for 10 nights in October 2010. My husband and I and our teenager had been to Bali a number of times before, but our friends, with their teenage daughter and two under five, had not been before. \nWe arrived at the airport to have Thomas meet us, and although we didn't get to the villa until about 10pm, the owner, Nilesh, was there to say hi and make sure we had everything we needed. He was also there to say goodbye when we left. The villa was better than it presented on the website. It's tucked away in a quiet lane off the main street of Sanur, and close to the beach and restaurants, and markets. The villa's very private, and surprisingly spacious. Having breakfast cooked for us every morning was amazing. The pool and the adjoining bale were luxurious. We even had a birds nest in our outdoor bathroom, and were able to watch the baby and parents each time we had a shower, until the baby flew away! Our friends\u2019 daughter turned 14 while we were there, and we arranged for the staff to cook an amazing dinner for us in the villa that night. The staff organized a beautiful cake for us, and we all had a fabulous evening..\nOn the days when we felt like exploring, the staff organised transport and advice, from where to have shoes made, to where to find a doctor in Denpasar when my husband put his neck out. \nStaying at Villa Seriska allowed us all to relax totally and feel pampered, which is a rare thing. All the staff  were wonderful.  We are planning our next trip already, and we just arrived home today! We\u2019re would definitely stay there again.",

              "text": "We recently stayed at this villa for 8 nights in Sep/Oct 2010 and recommend it for anyone looking to stay in Sanur. My family (2 adults and 2 children) and our friends (2 adults and 2 children) booked this villa in the hope of spoiling ourselves a little. The villa has plenty of room with spacious bedrooms, a beautiful pool and a large living area so you don't feel like you are living in each others pockets. The staff were tremendous making us feel very welcome, with the owner Nilesh happy to accommodate us with any requests/needs. The villa itself is in a great location, just off one of the main roads in Sanur. Close to the beach with your own access way to the beach. Down at the beach there are plenty of restaurants and shopping and places to get a massage. You certainly don't go hungry in the morning with plenty to eat for breakfast and a good selection to suit most tastes. The property was very very clean and we wouldn't hesitate to go back again in the future. The pictures on the web probably don't do it justice, and Nilesh was happy to answer any questions promptly prior to our arrival and even after our arrival. The only concern I would have is the kids can feel a little remote from the adults bedroom as the bedrooms are separated by a bathroom. You can't leave the bathroom door open as it is susceptible to mosquitoes. But depending on the age of your kids this can be a good thing! Our kids were aged between 7-10 years so it didn't present to many problems. On the whole a fantastic holiday, the villa amenities/facilities were excellent and its location fantastic!",

The owners of these Villas should be proud of what they have designed and produced.\nMagnificently, designed, presented and appointed. \nAll rooms have all the things you would come to expect from a five or 6 star hotel. \nWe checked into Villa one in Sanur. \nRooms are spacious, bathrooms are divine with Baths and outdoor showers, and can walk out of most rooms straight to the beautiful pool. \n24 hour security at the front entrance. \nAbsolutely magnificent, and will definitely be staying here next visit to Bali. Cannot praise it enough.\nSo happy I found this place. Thanks guys, look forward to seeing you next time. \nRegards Cameron",

Putra the manager was waiting for us on arrival and the complimentary transfer from the airport was easy. It was a very late check in and everything was explained well. All the staff were fabulous with a special mention to the chef. We ate in on our last night and he cooked us a feast of seafood and traditional Balinese dishes, it was amazing. \n\nThe Villa is made up of an enclosed kitchen and lounge area, then off that a sundeck and a wing that is 3 of the bedrooms, one is a bunk room, then a twin single the bathroom joins these 2 with interconnecting doors. Then a double bedroom with its own bathroom and sunken bath also interconnects to other rooms.  There is also the 4th stand alone master room with its own huge bathroom. The pool is an L shape around a gazebo with a spa pool also. \n\nThe location in north Sanur is perfect and close as to the beach through a locked gate but also quick access to the street. We hired bicycles which were a game changer to get around on and we all had many an adventure on them all organised through Putra and laundry service also. Complimentary breakfast was delicious.\n\nWe will be back again without a doubt. I also take tours to Bali from NZ and am getting this business up and running again post covid. Villa Seriska is now top of the list for our Sanur stays. Thank you Putra and staff for having us and being such wonderful people making everything so easy for a perfectly relaxing holiday. We appreciate you and your 5 star service.",

Their warmhearted welcomes, top class service and delicious breakfasts were the highlight of our trip. \nThe Villa was well well equipped with great AC. We loved every minute of our weeks stay here.\nThe Villa is a short stroll from lots of restaurants and bars . \nVilla Seriska is the perfect place to unwind after a days touring or after a good night out.\n",

The staff was extremely friendly, helpful and accomodating to all our requests and needs. Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good villa in sanur area. Excellent stay all in all",

Everything was amazing from the booking process, to the communication, the actual villa is wonderful , but the staff are what sets this apart from other places. Wayan and Rian and all the staff that looked after us were what made our holiday one to remember. Although this was our first stay it felt like we were coming home. Wayan\u2019s cooking was fabulous, was like we were eating in a top restaurant every night. The seafood \ud83e\udd9e bbq was blow your mind good and the Balinese banquet was pure comfort food. The fresh cooked breakfast was such a treat everyday and the best thing was you didn\u2019t have to even get out of your pjs! We did a half day tour which was perfect as we really didn\u2019t want to be gone any longer than that from the villa. The pool and gazebo were our happy place and we spent most of our time there chilling as a family. Super relaxing stay , just what we needed. Can not wait to come back!",

The villa itself is beautiful- great pool and grounds and the villa itself is very comfortable and beautifully appointed. The villa is so well maintained including evening turn down service and mosquito spraying etc - well up there with any 5 star resort. Nilesh was there to welcome us as well as see us off - thank you so much :) he and Putra the villa manager provided all essential information as well as recommendations on local places to eat etc. the staff also helped us arrange massages in the villa. And finally a mention of the wonderful team at Villa Seriska. Chef Wayan is such a gem - he and Kadek made the most awesome breakfasts every day and on our last evening he made us a lavish dinner. So much prep and hard work, such good food and so well presented and all done with a smile and genuine courtesy. We were so happy to be here - it was the crowning glory of our Bali stay and we will never consider staying anywhere else in Bali now! Have already recommended to all our friends and family! Thanks so much to the whole team at Villa Seriska :)",

Nilesh (Villa Owner) and Putra (Villa Manager) were very prompt in responding to queries and provided right advice. During our stay, Putra and his staff were fabulous in ensuring the villa was kept at its best in terms of luxury,cleanliness, breakfast choices and timeliness. Putra was instrumental into giving us useful suggestions based on our interests and we were happy to go along with his recommendations to plan our day outings while in Bali.Most importantly he is a patient listener. It was money worth for such an enriching experience. The kids thoroughly enjoyed the property and were well taken care of by the staff while we were away shopping. Definitely a recommendation.",

The villa is great, no different than the beautiful pictures which caught our eyes when booking. We had a warm welcome from Villa Manager Putra at the time of our arrival and enjoyed the very friendly (but never obstrusive) staff. Nilesh and Putra provided wonderfull support in helping arranging special diner to celebrate 30years wedding anniversary of my parents. The private chef prepared the tradinational balinese Babi Guling for us which turned to be a trumendous delight for everybody. Overall great experience. The only regret was to not be able to use the Jacuzzi as it was due for service at the time of our stay. But that is just one of the many reason why we will come back to Villa Seriska! ",

Very luxurious and even though the Villa is advertised as being only for 2 people, it even comes with a second bathroom which was great! We were greeted by the owner Nilesh and staff Putra, Made and Komang. Nilesh was great to deal and helped us orientate ourselves to the new location. Putra was always just a phone call away if we needed anything, and Made and Komang assisted us with taxis and any random day-to-day things. We have never encountered such professional and friendly staff before visiting Villa Seriska. The staff even helped me to arrange a surprise birthday dinner in our Villa for my partner, in which they cooked us a delicious seafood BBQ and also decorated our Villa for the occasion. Amazing! \n\nThe Villa is located a short walk off the main road, so it is easy to access some of the best restaurants Seminyak has to offer. It was easy for us to catch taxi's to some of the most popular nightspots, such as Ku De Ta or Potato Head, which are only a couple of km's away. Keep in mind the Villa location is still in a busy area, so when you are swimming in your private pool outside you can still hear some noise from the streets, but this was fine with us.",

I initially chose Nilesh's villa because I have 10 guests and I'd like the villa to be in modern style so that the guests can live comfortably, and his villa completely satisfied my needs. This was the starting of my fantastic journey with Nilesh. For my wedding ceremony, I need to arrange a wedding dinner for all my guests. My wife and I had a lot of requirements and ideas about this wedding dinner, and Nilesh was so helpful and thoughtful along the entire process of planning and accomplishing this wedding dinner: Firstly, We had at least 20 long and organized messages back and forth to discuss the menu, style, drinks, price of the wedding dinner, and he was always able to accomodate my requests by coordinating with his team; Furthermore, since it's a wedding dinner, we wanted to decorate the villa according to a picture that my wife and I like, he helped us perform a lot of research and eventually found a great decoration provider; Lastly, my wife and I requested a \"Photo Booth\" van but there is not a concept of this in Bali at this point, Nilesh helped us find a beautiful VW van and decorate it to help us achieve the \"Photo Booth\" van concept. On the wedding dinner day, the rain is on and off, and Nilesh and his team can quickly react to the weather and help us adjust the setups/decorations. We really appreciate all his efforts of planning and making all this happen. My wife, all my guests and I all think very highly of this wedding dinner. Since this is the first time of me in Bali, I had a lot of questions regarding to food, transportation, drinks, tourist places, etc, Nilesh was so helpful and helped us resolve all our questions and concerns. He also had a good team in the villa: Thomas was our driver, our wedding ceremony required a lot of rides here and there, and he was always able to arrive and deliver on time. For some of the days, he even worked more than 12 hours, for example, we need him to help us pick up guests and send to the wedding ceremony place, and we need him to help us send my guests back to their hotel after the wedding dinner, etc. Eka helped us cook daily breakfast, lunch and dinner. If you like spicy food, please try his Indonesian Stir-Fried noodle with his secret chili sauce, it was sooo good! Putra, Alet and Nur helped us take care of other normal stuffs including managing the daily matters, pressing shirts, sending/picking up laundry for my wedding suits, cleaning the room, etc. In a word, we really really enjoyed our stay at Nilesh's villa, and without his help along the way, we for sure cannot achieve such a successful wedding ceremony.",

              "text": "We recently stayed in Villa Seriska Dua, Sanur for 5 nights. My husband, 4 yr old daughter and 18 month old son shared this beautiful villa with our good friends and their 2yr old daughter, and we could not have picked a better place to stay. We had all been to Bali before but it was our first time with kids so we were drawn to villa Seriska because of its resemblance to a family home. We wanted the kids to be able to roam freely and enjoy themselves without needing constant herding and supervision- I originally avoided looking at villas because of the pool issue- (none of our kids are confident in the water without our presence) but a pool fence was installed at our request for no extra cost which allowed us to really relax and enjoy ourselves! \nThe layout was ideal for two families with two amazing master suites at opposite ends of the property (great for privacy!) and two twin single rooms for our kids close by our master suite. The central living space is bright and airy, beautifully furnished with Balinese style decor. The villa looks in real life every bit as beautiful as the pictures on their website.\n\nThe villa staff were as 5 star as the villa itself- from Thomas (the driver) and Wayan who was there every morning to open up the doors and make coffee for us, the chef who prepared a delicious breakfast every morning, to Nilesh (the host and owner) who was there to welcome us to and bid us farewell from the villa, and Putra (manager) who also welcomed us, and gave us a mobile phone with which to contact him at any time with any requests. There are also friendly staff in the security area at the front of the villa 24 hours a day- we hardly knew they were there but we felt incredibly safe knowing they were. \n\nMassages were organised by Putra at our request and the masseurs were there within minutes- best massages we have ever had right there by the pool for an incredible price. \n\nEvery evening the beds are turned down, the bedrooms sprayed for mosquitoes and coils lit in all the bathrooms- I didn't get bitten once in 5 days! \n\nAnd finally the location- at the southern end of Sanur it's more of a quiet residential area, but plenty of restaurants, ATMs, 24hr supermarkets- even a bottle shop- within a 5 min walk of the villa. We walked to the beach in about 10 minutes but that's with 3 kids under 5- it would be a lot quicker otherwise. Plus there are bicycles for use if you wanted to ride it would be 5 minutes or less. We found plenty of great restaurants a couple of streets away and rarely needed to use a cab!  Also- we had the chef cook up a fantastic 3 course Indonesian meal for us at the villa one night which was sensational, and one of the lovely ladies even entertained our crabby 18 month old for half an hour so we could enjoy it in peace! \n\nA fabulous villa, perfect location, amazing staff- I just can't fault Villa Seriska Dua and we will be back many more times in the future! \n\n",

              "text": "Everything was perfect, we stayed there 10 days with our 8 and 10 yo daughters. Nilesh was waiting for us at the villa when we arrived (he sent us a driver to pick us up at the airport), we immediately felt at home,, the villa is beautiful. Everybody was nice there, helping us planning our itinerary, our meal, our confort every day. They also give us a cell phone for local call with a credit in case you need to reach them, specialy Putra, the villa manager, who took really good care of us. Thinks may help : you don't need to carry all your dressing in your suitecases, you can give a landry bag to the staff and they bring us clean the day after for about 1$/kg. You have a lot of restaurants, take away food, supermarkets all around the villa or on the beach if you need anything. We also enjoyed the pool to much. I already recommend Nilesh'villa to friens of mine who are planning to visit Bali. Thanks again for everything, we will come back :) An unforgettable stay in a beautiful island with friendly people. Tout est parfait, nous avons s\u00e9journ\u00e9 10 jours avec nos filles de 8 et 10 ans. Nilesh nous attendait \u00e0 la villa \u00e0 notre arriv\u00e9e (apr\u00e8s avoir envoy\u00e9 un chauffeur nous recuperer \u00e0 l'a\u00e9roport), on s'est imm\u00e9diatement senti \u00e0 la maison la villa est sublime. Tout le monde est super gentil, ils nous ont assist\u00e9 dans la planification de nos visites, des repas, tout ce qui pouvait rendre notre s\u00e9jour confortable. Ils nous ont \u00e9galement remis un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone portable avec un cr\u00e9dit pour les appels locaux pour nous permettre de les joindre, sp\u00e9cialement, Putra, le manager de la villa, qui s'est parfaitement bien occup\u00e9 de nous. Petites informations qui peuvent vous aider : vous pouvez remettre votre linge sale au personnel qui le portera au pressing pour 1$/kg de linge, pas besoin de surcharger les valises. Il y a autour de la villa, ou sur la plage, de nombreux restaurants, sur place ou \u00e0 emporter ou des supermarch\u00e9s avec tout le nec\u00e9ssaire. Et la piscine est fantastique. J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 recommand\u00e9 la villa de Nilesh \u00e0 des amis qui prevoient de partir prochainement \u00e0 Bali. Un s\u00e9jour inoubliable sur une ile magnifique avec les gens merveilleux",

              "text": "Bali has to be one of my top favourite places to holiday. It\u2019s not just the fact that it\u2019s an island paradise with beautiful beaches, sunsets, tropical foods and scents, it\u2019s the service and smiles that come with it that make it the holiday of a lifetime. Our recent family adventures took us first to Sanur and then to the magical Klungkung. I\u2019m so happy to have explored different parts of Bali, both so very beautiful and unique in their own right. We stayed at 2 magnificent villas run by Villa Seriska, and I now understand why they have been voted Number #1 on Trip Advisor and won the Certificate of Excellence in 2013 and 2014. The villas, the details, the luxury, and above all the hospitality and services were faultless. As a couple of hard working parents in great need of some pampering and relaxation, we certainly received more than we could have expected. And all with a smile and gratitude.\nWe have been blessed to have experienced our fair share of luxury holidays around the world, but Bali always seems to come out on top. It\u2019s all in the details. At Villa Seriska we had our own personal chef to cook us whatever we liked, catering to our own special needs and dietary requirements. A driver to take us anywhere we fancied, though we didn\u2019t feel like leaving at all, as it was just too beautiful in our villa :) We had a wonderful manager to attend to any needs that arose\u2026and travelling with children there are usually quite a few ;) It surely helps to make a holiday with your kids an actual holiday when you have so much help. Our lovely housekeepers were so wonderful with the children and even offered to help us with babysitting when we needed. My children fell in love with them and couldn\u2019t wait to see them each day. They were so happy, and so were we. My wonderful husband, Bobby and I, had time to really connect. Beach walks, watching the sunset whilst talking about our dreams and aspirations and sweet kisses under the gazebo. It was all so very magical.\nSanur is seriously the perfect place to stay in Bali if you want a little luxury, beach, shopping and dining without it being too crowded. It is so much quieter than Kuta (in the best possible way) though there is still so much to do right at your doorstep. Upon stepping out of our villa we had restaurants, bars, boutiques, beach markets and of course the beach with a spectacular view of Lembongan Island and Mt. Agung. Our 4 bedroom villa, perfect for families and groups of friends, was decked out in all kinds of detailed design perfection. Everywhere I looked I was amazed by something beautiful. The woodwork, the towel designs, the flowers, the bathrooms\u2026.it was all so divine. The gazebo, spa and pool area were definitely the best and thoroughly utilised by us all each day and night. My children were obsessed with feeding the koi fish, cannon balling off the gazebo into the pool, and the chef\u2019s amazing food!\nWe can\u2019t thank owners Audrey and Nilesh, and the beautiful staff of Villa Seriska enough for their generous hospitality and very genuine caring. It\u2019s so refreshing and an absolute joy to stay somewhere like this. They really set themselves apart by their high standards.\nWith love and gratitude, Helen",

Right from the beginning the villa's owner Nilesh was helpful and ever courteous, replying to my email queries very promptly and in good detail. On arrival the villa was every bit as stunning as the photographs depicted and the staff went over and above to make our stay as comfortable as we could have hoped for. We were 7 guests from the UK but also had Australian family staying locally who came most days to visit us so ages ranged from 2.5 years old to 50's/60 year olds. The meals cooked for us were superb with so much attention to detail, you order what you would like the day before and pay for the ingredients and hey presto beautiful meals prepared for you the following day. Putra managed the villa and he was always ready at the end of the phone to sort out diving trips, cycle hire, island outings, yoga teachers and masseurs to visit - nothing was too much trouble. Wayan, Kadek and Rian looked after us and cooked for us at the villa and they really were so lovely - the Bali people that I have come to love so much in our couple of visits. Thomas our driver was an absolute character, picking us up and dropping us off sometimes on long 12 hour trips. He made us laugh so much as he nannied us about the island and often picking us up from different places that we'd arranged because we had found a cafe or a bar that we got 'stuck' in for the afternoon! It really was the most wonderful holiday experience, I will admit that I was nervous as it is obviously a fairly expensive holiday (for us as previous backpackers) but it was undoubtedly worth every penny and we would dearly love to go back and visit our Bali family again one day in the future. I cried on the plane home and have never done that before so says it all for me. Thank you so much everyone at Villa Seriska, we miss you :)",

              "text": "We recently returned from a month-long stay at the villa.  Bali being the destination of choice for a 50th birthday celebration.  \n\nWhen I think of the villa - the first thing that jumps to mind is the staff.  Some are there more than others, but everyone providing a service to this property was excellent!  All, just really good people who met our every need.  They can all take credit for making our stay very comfortable.\n\nAs for the villa - the interior is comfortable overall.  The bedrooms and bathrooms being the standouts.  The kitchen and living area could use a little TLC, which I did mention to staff and to the owner (Nilesh).  But the staff left it spotless for us each day.  I only rated \"sleep quality\" as 3 stars, because of a neighbourhood dog that barked endlessly at all times during the 24 hr clock!  (Not the owners dog (Monster) ... she's cool!)  But it had nothing to do with the beds.  They were excellent by everyone's account.\n\nThe outdoor space is peaceful and private, but again - in need of some love.  Just cosmetics really.  The lounge deck in wooden, and being exposed to the elements - all outdoor wood products need work over time.  (sand it, coat it and tack down the stray nails)   The pool is great and is cleaned regularly, and the lounge area offers rotating sun or shade throughout the day.  The garden areas surrounding the pool, entrance way and fish pond have a nice, tropical feel, but being in the industry - I couldn't help myself from wanting to change a few things.  It's well maintained as far as watering and cleaning, but could easily go from average to spectacular!  Slap a coat of paint on the privacy walls - repair some cracks in the concrete and get rid of that awful vine (some invasive morning glory'ish thing?) that is taking over everything!  All very easily done, and not an absolute necessity.  More so; things I would do as an owner.  Purely aesthetics :-)\n\nThe villa is located at the end of a very tidy lane, lined with other villas, and is just minutes to most of what you may need.  One of the main thoroughfares of Seminyak is just a couple of blocks away, and the beach - about 20 minutes on foot.  \n\nOverall - we were happy with the stay, and would recommend the villa to other travelers.  Again - I cannot say enough good things about the staff!",

              "text": "We recently stayed at Villa Seriska with a group of 9 of us, ranging in age from 19 up to 74. It was the perfect place to stay. The Villa was very spacious and given there was 9 of us, there was plenty of room for everyone. The pool was bigger than it looked in the pictures and we were most pleased to see that the villa lived up to the website (not always the case). We all found the beds so comfortable that I think we need to now replace ours at home to replicate the wonderful sleep we had there. The staff and owner, Nilesh, made our stay very easy. Nilesh was wonderful to communicate with prior to arriving and always responded within hours of my sent email. Thomas our driver  took us to some lovely restaurants and was only too happy to book a tour or suggest an activity for any interested. He never failed to come through with the goods. We were even provided with a local mobile so we could call if we had any issues while we were out (we named it the bat phone). We had young adults with us and Thomas was wonderful in giving them tips to stay safe while out clubbing in Kuta. Thomas even drove us to an orphanage and helped some of our family navigate the local supermarket for food supplies with one of the children from the orphanage. A staff member was often present during the day (doing housekeeping or tending to the gardens) but they were very unobtrusive. They had staff quarters on the property and would tend to wait for us to go out to attend to our rooms or ask if it was ok to go and clean the bathroom or make up our beds if we were around. The rooms were sprayed each afternoon to protect against bugs and mosquitos. What can I say about the location. It was great. The villa is down a short lane way off the main street of Sanur. For anyone who knows Sanur, The street cafe is literally on the corner of the lane way (very handy for a quick lunch or dinner. Try the pizza). Halfway down the lane way is a great day spa. Most of our group had a treatment there and they were very good. To head to the beach there's a locked gate that leads to the back of Sindu market. It was a very short stroll through the market and you came out at Benno's and Mango Bar restaurants on the beach. And if you're into your photography or just love the peace of a sunrise, you can't go past a saner sunrise.  It was also very reassuring to have a security guard positioned outside the villa 24 hours. One night we forgot to lock our door and were quickly reminded by security who'd done a nightly check. All in all we had a wonderful time and would highly recommend staying at Villa Seriska. We hope to come back again.",

We stayed at one of the new additions to the seriska collection in Seminyak and were very lucky to be looked after by all the amazing staff at the villa - the housekeeping staff, the chefs (amazing breakfasts!) management and the owners. Everyone was helpful and friendly. The addition of a pool fence is great for familes. Our daughter Maddy became very attached to \"Monster\" the owners dog - she was so beautiful and friendly and cuddly! The villa is situated in an ideal location in Seminyak - close to many excellent restaurants and shops. At the end of a long day shopping, we were eager to utilise the pool at the villa! We miss Villa Seriska .. thanks again to all the staff  \u2026 Maddy loved the \"towel animals\" creations every night ! Amazing ! Niluh, Maddy loved having you babysit, you are so lovely :) We hope to be back again one day!",

Nilesh the owner by giving on arrival  a very candid and elaborate intro of Bali clarifies all concerns,doubts enabling us to we jump into celebrations, fun and frolic from the word go. Staff headed by Manager/caretaker,Cook and support staff made our stay a memorable one. Thomas the driver took us around on all the four days and his familiarity and knowledge was a great help in meeting all our requirements of sight seeing,shopping and dining etc. Masseurs too were arranged at the villa itself.\n In short a wonderful holiday made so by the Villa-its location, tastefully furnishing, clean and safe  pool and hospitality of staff -it  made us wanting to extend our stay or come again asap.\nJust a suggestion for Nilesh. Small fridge in the bedroom and better lighting on the writing desk will help particularly the senior citizen types.",

              "text": "We had been planning my Dad's 70th birthday for over 9 months and chose Bali as the destination for the same. We were 14 people including kids and stayed at Villa Seriska in Sanur. When you are organising a family vacation ( Youngest Member being 15 months old and Oldest 75 years!) , you need to keep in mind that the place has to be convenient for all age groups. This Villa was perfect for that. \n\nIt has a private entrance to the beach, is located very close to the main shopping area at Sanur, has plenty of good restaurants and cafes nearby and has a very helpful and accommodating staff. The Villa is clean and tastefully done. If you are fine with spending a few extra bucks for the massages, you can even call someone to the Villa to give you one by the pool. The Villa's driver, Thomas is very good and knows his way around Bali. The chef prepared a delicious Mei Goreng meal for us. The manger, Putra arranged for a yummy cake for my Dad's birthday and also with our restaurant bookings. Nilesh, the owner had some great tips to share on how to plan your days and where to shop around. \n\nHighly recommended for a large group, looking for a home away from home!",

Both stays were wonderful \u2013 all the more so when Nilesh agreed to rent us the Villa last minute due to some problems with another Villa we booked elsewhere \u2013 it was a life-saver. The Villa\u2019s cosy for 7 adults & 3 kids with its 3 bedrooms. Very well kept, clean and comfortable. Location\u2019s unbeatable as its tucked into a small lane along Jalan Kunti so quiet and peacefully secluded, but still within 5-10 mins walking distance to the restaurants & shops along Jalan Kunti & Jalan Drupadi itself. Extremely convenient. As usual, Nilesh & team were very hospitable and welcoming, and we have a great time. And my kids can\u2019t forget the warm welcome from \u201cMonster\u201d the dog as well! Highly recommended and will stay at Villa Seriska Bali again in future.",

It is also very well located in Seminyak, close to many shops, cafes all well within walking distance. The breakfasts we had prepared were very tasty, freshly prepared by Villa Seriska's in house chef and greatly appreciated by all our family. Our children loved the pancakes in particular. \n\nWe would definitely return again.  Nilesh the owner, is a very helpful and accommodating host and his staff in particular, Niluh, Made and Mura were wonderful. We had a very relaxing stay, just what we needed after a hectic few weeks. Thankyou again to all staff at Villa Seriska and hope to see you again soon.",

Thank you Nilesh (owner) for recommending the Villa that suited our family dynamic. To Putra, excellent service extended to all of us and meeting with our needs. Thanks to Thomas (or Tho Must), our driver for all 4 days. To Chef who cooked sumptuous breakfast everyday and as well to the housekeeping team. We felt instantaneously at home the minute we stepped through the Villa's gate.=D\n\nVilla Seriska Sanur Dua is a brand new addition to three existing villas (we saw the one in Seminyak as well). It has a modern, single leveled, spacious open concept layout, with 4 well sized bedrooms + en-suites each (which we loved!), a relaxing pool area + dinning table (if you choose to have our meals outdoors). Equipped with a modern kitchen, dinning area, TV/living area, wi-fi/computer, a mini first aid kit and a Villa mobile phone to contact the staff needed during your stay. \nIt is not located at the beach front, but mere 5-7 min bicycle ride away (provided by the Villa).=)\n\nUnfortunately, we have not been able to fully enjoy the tranquility and services (such as spa, lunch or dinner) available at the Villa during our short stay. Therefore we will make it a point to re-visit ANY of the Villas Seriska in the near future! \nOnce again, a BIG THANK YOU to the Team for the 5* personalized hospitality/service extended to our family; making this trip a memorable one!",

              "text": "Villa Seriska is truly excellent. We had a wonderful holiday. Nilesh and his team are fantastic and really look after you in all respects. This villa already has wonderful reviews and I fully endorse all the wonderful comments made. Villa is beautiful with gorgeous garden. It is very close to all the activity in Sanur but tucked away down a small side lane off the main street so very quiet and private. Walking distance to all restaurants, shops, beach front etc. Sanur itself is really great with a wonderful atmosphere. There are loads of excellent restaurants and very cheap. Our favourites were Warung Little Bird (very close to Villa), Pregina, 3 Monkeys, Cinnamon, Mades (evenings only), Rib, Tootsies and Beach Caf\u00e9 (last 2 on the beachfront). Street restaurants were slightly better than beach ones but all are very good. Spa/salon nearest to Villa is excellent too.",

Special thanks to Putra for organising everything for us and to Niluh and the 2 Mades for their excellent services. We also appreciated that Nilesh (the owner) was there on our first and last day to welcome us and to say goodbye and inbetween to have a look if everything was ok, very nice gesture. You are all so friendly and smiling every day!\nWe were also very lucky, that there was a pool fence and stair fence, so our children (3&1) were safe all the time :-)\n@Niluh: Wayan and especially little Made will certainly miss you. Wayan already asked when we will see Niluh again.\nWe are sad that we had to leave after almost three weeks. Hope to see you again some day!",

              "text": "We were a group of two Australian families with children aged under 5. \n\nWe stayed for one week in Seriska and one week in their new sister villa called Seriska Dua. I will talk a bit about villa seriska first. \n\nVilla Seriska was perfect. It had attentive staff, beautiful rooms and the location was a pleasant 5 minute stroll through a private pathway down through a local market then to the beach. The area of the beach it is located at is good because it is in the main area and not near the big hotels' private beach areas. \n\nThe facilities are made as if the owner had built it to live in it himself. The area is staffed by security and you cannot hear much from surrounding villas or traffic. The staff are superb. They went out of their way to help us when the kids got sick. The manager Putra was fantastic and very obliging and was always contactable by the villa's mobile phone. \n\nWe brought mosquito nets with us but found they were unnecessary as the staff do a turn down service and put out  mosquito coils for the outdoor bathroom areas and close the sleeping areas. There is a local small supermarket 2 minutes walk away. There is a larger supermarket called Hardys that is a taxi ride for under $5. By the way if you want souvenirs you can get a lot of them at Hardys. \n\nBeach- good beach for little kids because of the off shore reef unlike seminyak which has big waves. The beaches aren't the fine white sand and pristine blue waters you get elsewhere (in fact Australia's beaches are much better) however the water was warm. \n\nVilla Seriska DUA\n\nWe stayed our second week in the newer villa seriska. Location was not that good. It takes a good 10-15 minutes to walk to the beach and then that's to the area of beach where all the big hotels are. Therefore you have to walk another 10 minutes further as the hotels will not allow you to use their beach chairs etc even if you offer to buy food and drinks from their \nrestaurants. Bikes are provided by the villa but if you have little kids then it is not suitable. There is one child seat however. We lamented that perhaps a hotel on the beach would have been nice as you can just walk straight out on to the beach or pool which are 30m from each other. However there is the advantage of having a villa to yourself. \n\nThe villa itself is good but not as good as the original seriska. It has been made as a rental. The bedroom with a pool view is very nice but the garden view room is not as nice so if you're going halves with another family you will have to rock paper scissors. Also the garden view bathroom had a constant sewerage smell from bad drainage (shower took a long time to drain). The staff are excellent and I highly recommend having the chef cook dinner for you in the villa. \n\nBaby sitting is available through a local lady who was excellent with our 6 month old and comes highly recommended. \n\nDay trips are possible to almost anywhere in Bali. You can hire a driver at seriska for about US$40-50 called Thomas. He's a nice guy but he will take you to the usual tourist haunts where the big tourist buses go eg supposed fine art galleries that seemed quite massed produced in our opinion. However if you do your \nresearch before you can go where you like. We found a great local artist in Sanur that has authentic non-commercial art. \n\nAll in all the seriska staff are excellent and the seriska number one comes highly recommended. \n\n",

              "text": "We stayed at the villa for a week with two families (two three year olds and a six month old baby). It was great. Comfortable rooms with semi-out door bathrooms, gorgeous pool and gardens, nice communal living areas. The location is great -- short stroll from the beach and the main street in Sanur. The staff are lovely. One night our little boy was sick and the chef, Ketut, went out twice on his motorbike to buy medicine for us. Very kind. I recommend having dinner at the villa. The surrounding restaurants are fine but nothing spectacular. One of our best meals in Bali was made by Ketut. He bought fresh seafood from the markets in Jimbaran and made a traditional Balinese dish for us. Friends stayed a second week in Villa Seriska Dua, which is also nice but Villa Seriska has nicer pool and gardens and better location (although Seriska Dua provides bikes to help around). There is no pool fence possible at Villa Seriska but we kept our eyes on the kids, assisted by the nanny recommended by the villa, Ni-Luh. Ask for her, she's great!",

We felt throughout our stay that in fact the quality of the staff is a major strength of the villa. They love their job and always go the extra mile with a bright smile. Nilesh has been a great communicator, answering all our questions promptly. Putra is a fantastic organiser as he needs to manage four villas, not just this one. Kadek is an amazing housekeeper and we loved Rian's happy bubbly nature. They were both amazing at helping us relax, taking care of things without being intrusive. Tomas! We were so happy to have booked him for the whole length of our stay. He was so very flexibility which is good with an extended family of 10. Thank you, Tomas! The villa is beautiful. New and most importantly sunny. The pool was just the right temperature to cool us down, but not too cold. I will never get over the bathroom. I want one at home\u2026..somehow I don't think it's possible. We will simply have to come back again to experience the wonderful hospitality! Will miss you all!",

The Villa is fabulous, the staff are wonderful, and the location is perfect!\nWe were picked up from the airport, then met at the Villa by Nilesh the owner, who introduced us to the staff and told us what to expect and gave us some great tips. \nNothing was too much trouble for the staff. Putra, the Villa's manager did everything possible to make our stay perfect, from sorting out my lost suitcase to recommending and booking activities and great places to eat.\nThe breakfast each morning was fantastic, cooked by the chef Ketut, and the proximity to the beach and the markets was a bonus.\nEverything about this place was amazing with absolutely nothing to fault!\nI'd recommend it to anyone, including groups of friends but particularly to families...perfect for 2 families holidaying together.",

Owner Nilesh is dedicated to providing world class hospitality, villa manager Putra is 100% personally committed and professionally qualified to cheerfully customize the experience to each family's needs and quirks, chefs Wayan and Katut prepared fantastic meals and a welcoming environment when we returned from our day trips each evening, and the housekeeping and security staff made sure we were taken care of 24/7. The pool was the center for gathering and relaxing, while four bedrooms (each with a huge fantasy bathroom) provided privacy. Highly recommended for families and other groups.",

We were with 6 adults and three little children and it was so nice to be in a villa like this. The swimmingpool, bathrooms, bedrooms, livingroom, everything was great.  I\u2019ve never been in a hotel or apartment so luxury as this villa. Also the location was perfect in the centre of Sanur. The owner, Nilesh is also a very nice and reliable person. When we send him an email, he always replied to us the same day.     \n When we are going back to Bali we will definitely book Villa Seriska again. Thanks again Nilesh and all the other persons of Villa Seriska for an unforgettable vacation. Please don\u2019t hesitate to book this villa, I promise you that you will love it, just as we do.",

The location met the requirements of ALL of the group. One member of the family is a Celiac, NO problems the menu can be adapted to all needs and the food was delicious. We found everyone professional, kind, helpful and VERY knowledgeable.The location is close to everything, however there is no intrusion of noise into the tranquility of the villas which are beautifully presented and furnished. We are extensive travelers and it is the ONLY destination we have stayed in where a safety fence was erected around the pool simply for the safety of our youngest grandchild. That is service!!!

We were greeted by Nilesh when we arrived, who was kind enough to brief us about Bali, closest grocery shops, spas and shopping around the area. \n\nThe team are very kind and friendly people. They accommodated to our requests and made sure that we were well taken care off. We rented their van for 2 days and went around Bali, covering the main attraction spots that we wanted to cover.\n\nThe villa is decently priced, and is within walking distance to Chill Spa and Prana Spa which is also a must go when in Bali. Bali Deli is the nearest supermarket, a bit pricey but the food's fresh. If you don't mind walking, head further along Seminyak st and there is a local supermarket called Bintang.\n\nWarung Made, the famous Indonesian cafe at Seminyak is just 10 mins walk away from the villa, which was extremely convenient for us. There is also Warung Pak Malen, famous for babi guling which is approx 20 mins walk from the villa.\n\nIf the weather's good, enjoy the walk as there are plenty of shops around.\n\nI truly enjoyed the stay at Villa Seriska and will definitely stay at the villa again!",

Nilesh and his team were just incredible. All so very friendly, honest and helpful. \n\nThe rooms were gorgeous and we really enjoyed the bathroom in the master bedroom. The decor was beautiful- and loved having all the lighting options. The air conditioner worked a treat and having ceiling fans was great for circulating air.\n\nWe spent lots of time in the well designed, large swimming pool. The fish pond was wonderful also and a favourite with the children.\n\nThe location of the villa is great. An easy walk to the beach/ markets and 20 metres to the main street with a huge selection of great restaurants/ warungs.\n\nThank you to the staff for taking great care of us and adoring our children! It really was a fantastic family holiday, one where treasured memories were made.",

The villa staff were all the same as our previous visit 6 months ago which is a testament to how much they love their jobs and their employer.  We got to meet Nilesh, the owner, this time around which was lovely.  I correspond with him for bookings and pre-vacation requests and he is always so helpful and accommodating, so it was nice to finally meet him.   As per usual all our requests were in order, pool fence was put up and our shopping requests were waiting for us in the fridge.   We were able to relax and start enjoying our vacation from the minute we set foot in the villa.   Putra, the villa Manager was as helpful as ever.   We set about choosing our favorite restaurants from last visit and a few new ones we wanted to try.  After an hour or so Putra had secured bookings for us.   I would recommend you book restaurants in advance as the popular ones do book out and you don't want to be disappointed.    We spent most of our time relaxing in the villa by day and enjoying the great food and bars by night.  We celebrated my sons birthday and the Team made it extra special providing cupcakes and helping us decorate to make it feel like a real birthday party.  He was so happy :)    We did decide to take a trip over to Sanur to visit the beach and have lunch.   We also decided to have a quick look at the Villa Seriska in Sanur.  It is absolute superb and will definitely try it on our next visit.   We can't wait to try something different but enjoy all the great service that Villa Seriska provides. .  Thanks Nilesh and team for another fantastic Bali Experience.",

The staff was extremely welcoming and friendly, they helped with everything they could including taking care of our two small children, the chef cooked very delicious food for us and by request they took care of our laundry (at a very good price I found out later). Absolutely fantastic. \nThe Villa is very clean and I loved the interior. Modern Balinese I would say. The bathrooms are semi openair which gives a fantastic feeling of being outside. The pool area and the garden are well maintained and clean. I would recommend Villa Seriska to everyone who is looking for some luxury.\nThe street that the Villa Seriska Dua in Sanur is located at is not very interesting, but it's only a short walk (10-15 min.) to the beach or the center of Sanur and there are bicycles you can borrow for free, so it's very easy to get around.",

Lovely breakfast served each morning after an early morning swim. Day trips to Ubud, Lembogang and, of course, Uluwatu.

              "text": "We stayed at the Villa Suta in Seminyak.What a beautiful place with warm staff. Absolutely loved it and was so well set up for families with small children. Highly recommend this villa. Lovely substantial breakfast, staff couldnt do enough for you. Was so sad to leave and we will miss everyone. Location close to restaurants and spas and not too far from all the usual attractions. Few hundred metres to Bali Deli to stock up or 5-10 minutes walk to Bali Bintang shop. Pool fence was awesome as we didnt have to worry about our 2 year old. Cant wait to go back, wish we could have brought the staff home with us! Kelly, Kevin and family, Perth.",

The staff, service, food and the compassion & generosity were all far beyond our expectation. Travelling with Mitchell (our 11year old autistc son) is not always easy, but you made it so enjoyable! The staff were so incredible with him and that means the world to us. We can't wait to come back and we have already booked for next Easter :) Thanks also for making Paul's birthday in Bali so special.",

They were unobtrusive but were happy to organize any request that I had, including getting my laundry done the next day! Nothing was too much trouble and service was always with a smile.\nNilesh the owner, who lives in Bali goes the extra mile and was able to talk about what Bali has to offer in terms of restaurants and places of interest, etc.  On recommendation, I had the opportunity of going for a drink and watching a beautiful sunset at Hotel Ayana. \n\nThe Villa was surrounded by overhanging plants which gave the Villa a sense of privacy, an oasis of peace and calm. It was clean, spacious, air conditioned and the ladies cleaned it daily.  A well presented villa as described in the website.\nAlso loved the idea of having a shower with an open roof, it made me feel at one with nature and was quite the contrast from my white tiled bathroom in England.\n\nThe locations was great as the shops, cafes and local restaurants are 5 minutes walk from the Villa in Seminyak. The beach is close by with white sandy beaches that provide activities for adults as well as children.\n\nBreakfast was served and you can request for a light breakfast (choices of fruit and toast) or the full works ie bacon, eggs and toast. I had the chef cook an evening meal and was delighted with the food and it was presented in a typical Balinese style, with a smile.\n\nWill recommend this for singles like me needing to recharge your batteries, families, couples and honeymoon couples!!\n\nMy stay was most enjoyable and I would urge anyone considering staying in Bali and wanting to experience the full Balinese culture, while enjoying the hospitality of the staff in the Villa, this is the place for you.",

All of the staff of the villa made this trip very special- attentive, kind, and really wonderful.  The highlight for us was Ketut, the chef at the villa.  The food in Sanur is a strange hodge-podge:  Indonesian for foreigners sharing menu space with pizza, burgers at many of the restaurants in town...much of it with a few exceptions in the \"just fine\" category.  Ketut charmed us with his smile and his amazing food--creative, fresh, and adjusting for our son's peanut allergies as well as answering the barrage of questions from my inquisitive and enthusiastic 10 y.o daughter.\n\nThank you Nilesh and everyone at Seriska for a wonderful trip.  We take a piece of Bali home with us in our hearts because of you and your staff.\n\nOther highlights:  Tirta Gangga--the water temple.  Beautiful, idyllic.  Eat lunch at the restaurant (Tirta Ayu?) just adjoining the temple grounds for a lovely view.\nBamboo Shoots Cooking School in south Sanur.  Reasonably priced, patient, kind staff, great recipes (and yummy food).  It IS, for us, all about the food\nExploring black sand beaches in search of sandy beach break for fun waves!\nBali Marine Sports for small group diving..perfect for our novice and young (12 year old) divers.\n\nLowpoint:  Blue Lagoon.  Dirty, crowded, small beach with really no place to sit unless you get (pay) for one of the few loungers.",

              "text": "This is our third stay at villa Seriska in sanur, and we have already booked in again for next year. We feel that Seriska is our Bali home, and the Seriska staff our Bali family.this was a short stay only six nights and we found it too short. Next time we are coming for ten days. Previously we have stayed for two and three weeks. Why do we come back? We are a group of five busy women, and really relax at Seriska.  We know our way round the villa, we know the sellers at the market, we know the restaurants, and We know what to expect at Seriskabut we  also get some nice surprises. This year there was  a new outside eating area, a great improvement, a stunning birthday cake and even a photographic souvenir of our birthday party. \nAll of the staff appear to like their work, and go out of their way to ensure that our stay is as relaxing as possible, often anticipating our needs. \nKetut is an excellent chef, and also will help you with things you may require, like a push bike,or wrapping shopping.\nAgung always has a serene smile and makes you feel so comfortable.\nKedak had her last day with us before her maternity leave, she has the best smile and happy nature. This also impresses us that the staff from Seriska are treated well by Nilesh the owner of the villa.\nTomas is unflappable and the safest driver in Bali, he will assist you whenever he can. He has a good sense of humor also, important to us Aussies.\nPutra is also cheerful, helpfully and an all round good fellow who takes his job very seriously. When we complained about the pillow being too high he drove around Bali until he found a flat pillow.\nNilesh the owner is always welcoming, takes any suggestions we make on board and so very friendly and accommodating.\nWe have also stayed with our family at Seriska, we have found it suitable for adults and children and youn g adults --which surprised us a bit. We thought the kids would be out at the clubs at Kota and semi yak. But they chose to stay at the villa.\nWhen we had late flights, nilesh has accommodated this, this year making one of the villas at Seminyaknavailable available to us to use untill we flew out and did not charge for this.   Thanks Nilesh and staff for a relaxing and trouble free holiday .",

Great property, fantastic pool, awesome staff and the perfect location - 1 min walk to shops/restaurants on J L Tamblingan and a 2 min walk to the beach where you are spoiled for choice of places to eat.  Thankyou Nilesh, Putra, Thomas, Ketut, Ugung and Anna for making our holiday so memorable.  We haven't stopped raving about Villa Seriska to our friends since our return home, and are already talking about coming back for a 50th birthday celebration in three years time.  \n\nFrom Andrew, Kim, Sandra and children.",

The villa was just stunning, rooms spacious, stylish comfortable, fantastic kitchen and living area with huge tv, sound system and PC, the bathrooms were amazing the pool area was fantastic I could go on but I think you get what Im trying to say here! The villa is a 15-20min walk from the beach and 1min walk to the shops and restaurants. \nThe thing which makes Villa Seriska, Seminyak a must stay is the owner and staff. They are amazing and couldn't have been more friendly courteous and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble for them and they were always so friendly and chatty. Another key feature about this place and who I feel deserves a special mention is Monster the owners dog! he patters about outside the villa and is just such a lovely friendly dog and gives the place a homely feel about it!\n\noverall a massive thank you and 10 out of 10 for Villa Seriska, Seminyak from the Irish Girls",

My trip to bali was well worth it but what made it special was an extra friend who came to visit us when we reached the villa, it was Monster, Nilesh's dog.\nMy most deepest thanks goes out to Nilesh, and his team ,Putra, and the nice ladies, oh yes Chef's ( try the pancakes ) and thomas.\nSo all of you ,just stay here and dont look anywhere else. : )",

              "text": "Villa Seriska, Sanur is the right choice for our family of 9 with ages ranging from 5 to about 70.\nNilesh and his team were professional and at the same time warm and hospitable.  Feedback by previous reviewers on the services and the team were not overrated.  Kudos to Nilesh and all the staff!\n\nThe four bedrooms fitted our family perfectly with very comfortable beds and pillows. Our family had a good time getting together.  The space and facilities of the villa made it possible for the group to do different things at the same time and yet stayed close together, such as the kids splashing in the pool and guys sun-tanning on the deck while the ladies had massages in the bale. A truly enjoyable experience...   \n\nSecurity was not a concern to us as a lockable safe was provided in the master room.  Beside, the service staff were on stand-by in the villa from 7am till the evening, ensuring that someone was around in the villa while we were away on day tours with Thomas, the villa's driver, who was so patient and accommodating.\n\nIn terms of location, Villa Seriska is strategically located at the back of Sindhu beach market which can be accessed through a private gate.  The beachfront cafes and restaurants e.g. Benno's, were also within easy accessibility through the market.  The villa is about 5-7 minutes' brisk walk to McDonald's, about 15 minutes' walk to Hardy's and is near several nice warungs and restaurants along Jln Danau Tamblingan.  We were never short of dining choices.\n\nIndeed, our family had a wonderful time at Villa Seriska.  The freshly cooked hot breakfast every morning was something we looked forward to and gave us a perfect start to each day of our holiday in Bali. We wished we had stayed longer and hope we can be back!",

All the staff were prepared to go the extra mile, far beyond their call of duty. Tania and Kristofor loved the choice at breakfast every morning. Great to see the wildlife, couldn\u2019t believe seeing a squirrel here!! Monster (the owner\u2019s dog) helped us feel at home, just like having Bramble, our Golden Retriever, with us. We will all miss her and treasure our time spent with her. Thanks to all for making our holiday a memorable one!",

Nilesh and the staff are absolutely wonderful.  My sincere thanks to Putra (the Villa Manager) who shared with us some of the Indonesian culture and his friendship.  He made our trip very special.  Also the other staff Niluh, Made, Ketut and Kadek are friendly and made our trip memorable.  Made the chef makes the best nasi goreng ever.  All the food is prepared fresh and on site.  The villa is beautiful and I love the downstairs bedroom. There is plenty of open space and places to just relax and enjoy.  It is close to the main street and I recommend the coffee and food at the Bali Deli (which is a short walk from the Villa).  We were all sad to leave and hope to return to the Villa again.  This is the only place in Bali that I would stay.  I highly recommend the staff and Villa to anyone considering travel to Bali.  Thank you again to Nilesh and his staff for their extraordinary kindness and friendship and for making our trip to Bali so special.",

We have also enjoyed a mix of \nKetut's nice cooking and dinner at local restaurants. Even the food\nat the local night market was a real threat and is wothwhile trying.\nThanks a lot to the friendly staff and especially to Thomas and \nAgung who really became good friends.\n\nVi har hatt noen fantastiske dager her i Villa Seriska i Sanur. Villaen var perfekt for to familier med barn i alderen 7 til 12 \u00e5r, spesielt med tanke p\u00e5 det deilige badebassenget og den praktiske beliggenheten ned mot stranden. Vi har storkost oss med en blanding av dagsturer og rolige dager i Villaen. Det absolutte h\u00f8ydepunktet var snorkleturen til Lembongan med fantastisk sikt til korallrev og fisk. Vi har ogs\u00e5 nydt Ketut\u2019s gode m\u00e5ltider i Villaen og middager p\u00e5 lokale restauranter. Maten p\u00e5 det lokale nattmarkedet rett rundt svingen var spennende og absolutt verd \u00e5 pr\u00f8ve. Tusen takk til de hyggelige ansatte og spesielt til Thomas og Agung som ble gode venner.\n\nGro Skaar",

The villa is more beautiful in person than is portrayed in the photos on the website...the gardens are lush, facilities modern and swimming pool picture perfect. We also found that the villa was conveniently located. It is a short walk to the beach, markets, shops and restaurants but is also private and very quiet.  Whilst I could rave on about the accommodation it is really the staff that made this trip so special and memorable. Thomas was a fantastic driver and overall guide...he was flexible, helpful and we hired him most days to explore the island. Likewise, our chef, Ketut, was excellent.  He served us delicious breakfast every morning and several nights during our stay we hired him to cook dinner for us...I highly recommend the seafood feast! What also impressed me was that the staff was always warm and wonderful with our children. I hope that we will be lucky enough to stay at Villa Seriska again oneday. Thank you for our unique Bali experience!",

              "text": "My partner celebrated her 50th Birthday at Villa Seriska with friends during Nov Dec 2011. We had been there before to celebrate my 50th and couldnt think of anywhere we would rather celebrate again. We were so right to do so.  The villa is more than comfortable, it is 5 star luxury, with very comfortable beds, and furnishings. \nThe staff are great, Tomas and Ketut were so pleased to welcome us back and fill us in with all the news of the other staff. The girls were lovely. The staff seem to genuinely enjoy their work and this shows with their smiling faces. Tomas and Ketut were so helpful, Ketut going to the Post office for us and helping me organise a push bike, Tomas driving us round Bali and helping me with some painted glass. \nPutra arranged a special birthday cake, and when we complained about the thickness of the pillows, had thinner ones delivered the next day. Nothing was too hard for him. His english was excellent and he was just delightful.  Our friends also loved being there, in fact we loved it so much we have booked again for next year, not for a birthday but because we can.\nNilesh hope to see you In July.",

We were excited to be staying in a villa and sharing it with great friends. We were picked up from our hotel by Thomas and Putra in 2 vehicles, such warm and friendly people. I dont think we were prepared for the experience about to occur. When we walked through the doors to the villa our jaws dropped. Beautiful lush gardens, awesome pool, beautiful house greeted us. We were met by the staff of the villa and openly welcomed in the airconditioned dining room with a cold drink and cold towel. We settled in easily and could not believe our lucky stars, this definitely felt like we were royalty.  I recommend guests of the villa to make full use of Thomas (The driver) and also the in-house Chef Ketut \u2026. Meals were delivered so eloquently from a choice of 3 breakfasts to in house menus. All the pictures speak a thousand words about the villa. All the staff were fantastic with our three children and so warm  nd friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. If we could put everything we feel into words to express our thanks  and gratitude to all working for Villa Seriska who contributed to our wonderful end to our holiday, I would need an entire book!!\n\nWell done Villa Seriska Sanur and commendations. We will definitely be back next year.",

Coming from a hotel to the Villa Seriska was an entirely rewarding and positive end to our holiday in Bali. I recommend guests of the villa to make full use of Thomas (The driver) and also the in-house Chef Ketut \u2026. Meals were delivered so eloquently. All the staff were fantastic with our three children and so warm  and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. If we could put everything we feel into words to express our thanks  and gratitude to all working for Villa Seriska, I would need an entire book!!\n\nWell done and commendations. We will definitely be back next year.",

We started each day with a dip in the pool followed by a breakfast which is filling enough to last way past lunch time. My husband celebrated his Birthday while we were there and Thomas arranged cake and flowers and a surprise present. If you are after a quiet relaxing  holiday away from the maddening crowds then Sanur ticks all the boxes and if you do feel the urge to party the night away then Thomas will arrange for a driver to take you to Kuta/Legian. Many thanks Nilesh for a holiday memories which will take a long time to fade. David and Caroline, Newcastle Australia",

We often holiday in Bali and have experienced many different forms of accommodation, but I guarantee we will be returning to Seriska. The villas are exquisite and beautifully maintained by wonderful staff who are always willing to assist you in any way possible.  We had 2 birthdays while staying here, and were surprised by cake, candles and song courtesy of Nilesh and his staff.  Nothing was ever too much trouble.\nWhile we arrived at Seriska as strangers, we left as friends. An enormous thanks to Nilesh, Thomas, Putra, Mr Ketut, Mrs Agung , Ketut, Iluh and Ana (and of course Monster!) for a fabulous 12 days.....can't wait to be back.",

              "text": "We have recently returned from a 15 night stay at Villa Seriska and every review you have read is true and perhaps don't do justice to the experience.\n\nNilesh the owner goes the extra mile to make your holiday stay special and will attempt to accommodate your every need. He was even able to organise the daily use of a basketball court at a local hotel so our daughter could practice. \n\nLocation: In an incredibly quiet, secure and private location, it's hard to believe you are essentially in the middle of Sanur. Nestled down a driveway off Jl Tamblingan, a myriad of local restaurants, jewellery stores and shops, are all within walking distance. After a stroll through the local market you are on Sanur beach, perfect for a quite beachside coffee or a leisurely walk or jog along the paved footway which runs all the way to the Hyatt Hotel at the south of Sanur.\n\nAmbience: Quite, peaceful and immaculately maintained, the villa is an oasis that exudes an overwhelming sense of calm.  A stunning pool is complemented by the surrounding gardens.  We enjoyed many hours relaxing and reading in the poolside gazebo, with its thatched Balinese roof and comfortable cushions.\n\nRooms: The bedrooms are beautifully presented and the bathrooms exquisite. The beds are large and comfortable and all rooms have both fans and air conditioning and include daily maid and downturn service. \n\nMeals: Breakfast was an experience every morning as we interacted with the warm and friendly staff and practiced our Indonesian. We switched between local, continental and American breakfasts and strongly recommend the banana pancakes. The teams were always available to help with any specific meal requests and on arrival Nilesh had arranged for a welcoming meal after our late arrival.  \n  \nStaff: The staff are quiet and discrete and willing to handle any request you may have. Thomas is just amazing, a wealth of knowledge and always available to provide assistance and direction, along with restaurant reservations and bookings for anything you may wish to do.\n\nPut Seriska high on your list as you will be hard pressed to find a more attractive alternative",

We had many guests come and stay with us, ages ranging from 4 to 50, and they all loved it also.\nWe have been to Bali many times before so weren't looking for the tourist trail, we wanted some luxury and comfort and thats what we got at Seriska.\nWe found Seriska last time we had been over, so went and saw it before we booked, but I believe the website does not do it justice, the main bedrooms are comfortable, spacious, and very clean., the other rooms were smaller with a shared bathroom, clean and bright.\nThe kitchen. lounge and dining are spacious, clean and very well equipped, we used the ipod player a lot, as well as the computer and dvd player. We spent most of our time on the lounges by the pool or playing in the pool.\nAll our guests were very happy with the rooms and facilities the child especially liked the fish in the bathroom. The young women loved the baths, and the bale best.\nThe staff really helped in ensuring we had a great time, the two chefs cooked great breakfasts every morning, especially banana pancakes, and the two nights we ate at the villa, the food was spectacular, best food I have ever eaten in Bali, the fish was very fresh and the steak had been sourced from Australia. \nThe three girls were delightful, fun and happy and always willing to lend a hand. Tomas was also great, nothing was too much trouble for him, He was even going to drive the young women out for a night in Kuta, and make sure they got home.\nNelish went to the trouble to meet us at the villa when we arrived and came over a few times to see how things were going, which we appreciated.\nI have no hesitation recommending this villa to friends and rellos, in fact most of mine stayed with us, and we are all planning on coming back next year.\nAfter staying in Legion for many times, I appreciated the slower pace of Sanur, we found many restaurants we liked, and we especially like some of the ones on the beach. We took transport and drivers everywhere we wanted to go, and found it very easy from Sanur.\nWe got to know many of the stall holders at the little market, and did quite a lot of shopping there, we espeically liked Serina the dress maker who made us all terrific and cheap, and havent fallen apart yet dresses, pants and shirts.\nWe honesty love Villa Seriska and will be returning as often as we can.",

Het personeel is erg vriendelijk en willen alles voor je doen.  De chef heeft h\u00e9\u00e9rlijk voor ons gekookt. In de buurt ook veel keus qua eettentjes. De chef is vrijwilliger bij het schildpaddenverblijf. Samen met hem naar toe geweest. Onze meiden hebben nog kleine schildpadjes vrij mogen laten. Geen entree, je kunt een donatie geven zodat ze dit voort kunnen zetten.  We raden deze villa dan ook zeker aan voor gezinnen. Erg groot en comfortabel met een heerlijk zwembad. Bedankt voor jullie gastvrijheid! We hebben onze vakantie fantastisch afgesloten bij jullie.",

Die Schlafzimmer liegen direkt am idyllischen Pool - ein Sprung reicht und man ist im k\u00fchlen Nass. Die Zimmer sind ausgestattet mit einer Aussendusche / Regendusche und WC. Zum Haus geh\u00f6rt eine K\u00fcche sowie ein grosses Wohnzimmer - am Pool hat es eine romantische \"Pergola\" zum Sonnenbaden - ansonsten hat es gen\u00fcgend Sonnenliegen auf der Terrasse. Das ganze Haus wurde mit viel Geschmack und Liebe zum Detail ausgestattet und hat den typisch Balinesischen Charme. \nWir wurden vom Besitzer Nilesh herzlich empfangen und zu einem Begr\u00fcssungs\u00e0pero eingeladen. Der Manager der Anlage Putra hat uns das ganze Haus sowie den naheliegenden Strand gezeigt und hat sich viel Zeit genommen f\u00fcr all unsere Fragen und Anliegen. W\u00e4hrend unseres Aufenthaltes wurden wir vom K\u00fcchenchef Ayan super bekocht und von Rihanna und Kollegin liebensw\u00fcrdig bedient. Zimmer werden morgens & Abends gemacht ( Abends werden als Insektenschutz R\u00e4ucherspiralen angez\u00fcndet im Bad). Der Chauffeur Thomas steht auf Abruf bzw. Reservation zur Verf\u00fcgung - sei es f\u00fcr den Airport-Transfer oder f\u00fcr einen sch\u00f6nen Ausflug zu diversen Tempeln und anderen Sehensw\u00fcrdigkeiten. Wir wurden wirklich sehr herzlich und kompetent bedient vom ganzen Team der Villa Seriska - wir k\u00f6nnen einen Aufenthalt jederzeit & ohne Einschr\u00e4nkung empfehlen. Wir waren sicher nicht das letzte mal dort...nochmals besten Dank!!",

Mukana pojan perheen 4-v. tyt\u00e4r.\nHaaste isois\u00e4n ruokavalio; gluteeniton. \n\nAsunnossamme oli makuuhuoneita 4. Tilaa 8:lle. Kaikissa yksityisyys, rauha ja hiljaisuus. Makuuhuoneet oli varustettu kukin omalla kylpyhuoneella , syv\u00e4ll\u00e4 poreammeella ja sadesuihkulla toimivine WC-tiloineen. Vuode oli leve\u00e4 ja tukeva. Vuodevaatteet hengitt\u00e4vi\u00e4. Peite untuvaa. Syv\u00e4n unen antoi matkalijoille.\n\nMiellytt\u00e4v\u00e4t oleskelutilat perheelle l\u00f6ytyiv\u00e4t sek\u00e4 sis\u00e4lt\u00e4 ett\u00e4 ulkoa. Tiloissa voi my\u00f6s ruokailla. Katettuja olivat.\nYmp\u00e4rist\u00f6 ja oma uima-allas kruunasivat milj\u00f6\u00f6n. Puutarhuri piti pihapiirin ja uima-altaan siisteydest\u00e4 huolen. Hyvin hoiti leivisk\u00e4ns\u00e4. \nKeitti\u00f6 oli toimiva isoine j\u00e4\u00e4- ja pakastinkaappeineen. Mikroaaltouuni, liesi ja astiasto tukivat omatoimista ruoanlaittoa. Isois\u00e4n keliakian takia innostuimme palkkaamaan oman kokin oleskelumme ajaksi. Kokki laittoi aamupalan ja p\u00e4iv\u00e4llisen Lounaan s\u00f6imme retkill\u00e4mme. Kokkimme oli erinomainen ruoanlaittaja. H\u00e4n hoiti ruoka-aineiden hankinnan toiveittemme mukaisesti. Herkullinen ruoka odotti meit\u00e4 her\u00e4tess\u00e4mme ja palatessamme p\u00e4iv\u00e4n retkilt\u00e4. \n\nKokin lis\u00e4ksi palkkasimme oman autonkuljettajan autoineen. H\u00e4nen ja manageri Putran avustamana suunnittelimme p\u00e4ivitt\u00e4iset retkikohteemme Balin keskiosaan, etel\u00e4rannikolle ja Kutan r\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4lille pukujen sovitukseen. Hyvin p\u00e4rj\u00e4si paikallinen kuljettaja Balin - v\u00e4lill\u00e4 kaoottisessakin, liikenteess\u00e4. V\u00e4yl\u00e4t olivat niin ik\u00e4\u00e4n huonokuntoisia ja hitaita ajaa. Olikin ainoa miinus saarella.\n\nTalon puolesta meit\u00e4 palvelivat;  vartija, sis\u00e4k\u00f6t ja puutarhuri. \n\nPesula oli kadun toisella puolella. Aamulla kun vei vaatteet pest\u00e4v\u00e4ksi. Pesula toimitti ne jo illaksi siistein\u00e4 ja taiteltuina asunnollemme. Villassamme oli viel\u00e4 ilmainen Wi-Fi, Tietokone, TV kanavineen, soittimia jne. Minua ilahdutti ilmainen pullovesi. Ei tarvinnut kantaa vett\u00e4 kaupasta. Shampoot, hoitoaineet, suihkusaipuat ja pyyhkeet tohveleineen\ntoivat ylellisyytt\u00e4 arkeemme. \n\nHenkil\u00f6kunta oli lapsirakasta. T\u00f6ittens\u00e4 v\u00e4liss\u00e4 ehtiv\u00e4t viihdytt\u00e4\u00e4 nelivuotiastakin. Riemullisina ruokkivat kokin kanssa punaisia kaloja villan kalalammikossa. Poikamme t\u00e4ytti 40 v. lomamme aikana. Omistaja henkil\u00f6kuntineen k\u00e4vi onnittelemassa ja toivat t\u00e4ytekakun lahjaksi. Kyll\u00e4 syk\u00e4hdytti.\n\nOnnellisia olimme n\u00e4kem\u00e4st\u00e4mme ja kokemastamme. Sylillinen  kiitoksia koko Villa Seriska Dua Sanur Balin omistajalle, johtajalle ja syd\u00e4melliselle henkil\u00f6kunnalle. Englannilla p\u00e4rj\u00e4simme. Edullista oli. Syd\u00e4memme j\u00e4i onnellisten ihmisten saarelle. Kaikki onnistui. Huolen meist\u00e4 pitiv\u00e4t.\n\nSuosittelemme huvilaanne ja tropiikin l\u00e4mp\u00f6\u00e4 kaikille jotka ajattelevat:  vain paras on kyllin hyv\u00e4\u00e4.

La villa \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s propre, super bien d\u00e9cor\u00e9e, bien climatis\u00e9e, et au calme. Elle \u00e9tait \u00e9quip\u00e9e de tout le n\u00e9cessaire, m\u00eame d'un bon anti-moustiques (tr\u00e8s important l\u00e0-bas). \nNous avons \u00e9t\u00e9 super bien accueillis par l'\u00e9quipe de Villa Seriska. Ils nous ont bien conseill\u00e9s, et aid\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9server des activit\u00e9s/sorties. Ils \u00e9taient vraiment adorables, serviables et tr\u00e8s disponibles. On se sent plus comme Invit\u00e9s que clients.  \nSeminyak est un quartier branch\u00e9, plein de bars et restaurants. La villa est \u00e0 5/10min \u00e0 pied de la plage de Seminyak. On peut y voir un super coucher de soleil d'ailleurs. A c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la villa, il y a des spas, restaus, et un supermarch\u00e9 (tr\u00e8s pratique, et le money changer du supermarch\u00e9 est fiable). \nNous recommandons vraiment cet h\u00f4tel.",

              "text": "Wir haben die Villa Seriska durch Trip Adivsor empfohlen bekommen, und wir wurden nicht entt\u00e4uscht. Es ist eine sehr sch\u00f6ne Villa mit 4 Schlafzimmern und grossem Pool. Ideal f\u00fcr Familien, da 3 Zimmer miteinander verbunden sind. Auch der kurze Weg zur Hauptstrasse oder durch den Lokalen Markt zum Strand machen die Villa zu einen Idealen ausganspunkt. Uebrigens hat es am Strand sicher 10 sehr gute Restaurants (klar Lokaler Touch), aber die sind zum Teil richtig gut. Beach Cafe zum Beispiel, oder Benus f\u00fcr mehr Indonesiche K\u00fcche. Das Personal wahr auch stets sehr freundlich. Vor unsere Buchung haben wir auch viele e-mails mit Nilesh ausgetauscht, um diverse Details zu bereden. Das hat immer 1A funktioniert. Vor Ort ist auch Putra und Tomast der Fahrer stets um unser Wohl besorgt gewesen. Unserer Kinder waren viel im Pool und hatten richtig Spass. Als einziges ist zu bedenken dass die Villa in den Tropen ist, und Bauweisen nicht immer bis ins kleinste Detail perfekt ist. Daraus ergibt sich auch, dass man sich halt auch einmal einen K\u00e4fer oder Frosch antrifft. Wir k\u00f6nenn aber die Villa nur empfehlen. Familie Martin Vogt",

Die Villa ist sehr gro\u00dfz\u00fcgig geschnitten und sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Besonderer Pluspunkt ist der sch\u00f6ne private Pool. Der Villa-Manager Putra und seine Mitarbeiter waren sehr freundlich, immer zur Stelle und haben uns bei vielen Fragen geholfen. Auch die Lage der Villa ist sehr g\u00fcnstig: ruhig gelegen in einer Seitengasse und dennoch sehr zentral zur Hauptstra\u00dfe mit vielen Restaurants und Shops in der N\u00e4he. Alles in allem hatten wir einen wunderbaren Aufenthalt in der Villa Seriska und k\u00f6nnen diese Adresse wirklich nur weiterempfehlen!",

              "text": "Vielen Dank f\u00fcr diesen tollen Urlaub in der wundersch\u00f6nen Villa Seriska. Das ist mit Abstand das sch\u00f6nste Haus, das wir je f\u00fcr unseren Urlaub gebucht haben. Das gesamte Team der Villa ist unglaublich zuverl\u00e4ssig, was f\u00fcr uns wirklich sehr wichtig ist. Das Haus ist sehr liebevoll eingerichtet und sehr sauber. Man f\u00fchlt sich wirklich rundum wohl und sehr sicher in der Villa und das gesamte Personal (inkl. des Wachpersonals der Gesamtanlage) ist super freundlich. Die Lage der Villa ist wirklich perfekt. Ortszentrum und Strand sind in wenigen Gehminuten erreichbar. F\u00fcr Familien ist Sanur wahrscheinlich der beste Ort auf Bali, da er f\u00fcr die Ausfl\u00fcge sehr zentral gelegen ist, das ruhige Wasser vor dem Riff sehr gut f\u00fcr kleine Kinder geeignet ist und der Ort im Vergleich zu Kuta doch ruhiger und beschaulicher ist. Und es ist trotzdem alles vorhanden, was man zu einem gelungenen Urlaub ben\u00f6tigt. Anders als in Nusa Dua, wo wir uns wahrscheinlich etwas gelangweilt h\u00e4tten. Es war wirklich ein sehr sch\u00f6ner Urlaub auf einer sehr sch\u00f6nen Insel, die wir noch gar nicht komplett erkundet haben (daf\u00fcr sind 12 Tage einfach zu kurz). Wir werden sicherlich irgendwann noch einmal zur\u00fcck kommen. Und dann nat\u00fcrlich wieder in die Villa Seriska.\"",
