              "text": "Sempurna, itu 1 kata untuk pelayanan semua crew di Mayflower - Marriott Executive Apartment. Dari mulai saya menanyakan pintu masuk parkir via telepon, layanan check in, security yang ramah dan helpfull, layanan restoran, hingga saat check out.\n\nSebagai 1st timer menginap di sini saya dapat free upgrade room, Alhamdulillah, terima kasih Marriott. View yang sensasional The Heart of The City jalan Sudirman hingga Bundaran HI. Room yang luas (lebih dari 80 msq) dengan kebersihannya sangat terjaga, complimentary kitchen set yang lengkap. Kamar mandi dengan bathub dan shower terpisah. Ada living room ruang bersantai bersama keluarga dengan sofa dan karpet, ada meja kerja dan ada meja makan dengan 4 kursi, tv ada 2 di kamar dan di ruang keluarga. Dilengkapi pula dengan mesin cuci + detergen. AC dingin, lift ada 4 dengan waktu tunggu yang cepat. Sarapan ada pilihan dine in dan take away (bukan delivery) dengan pilihan menu seperti buffet (bisa request lebih dari 1 menu), sehingga memudahkan untuk menjaga protokol kesehatan di masa pandemi ini. Sangat recomended dapat harga di bawah 1 juta dengan kualitas pelayanan dan fasilitas yang didapatkan.\n\nSatu lagi,lokasinya menyatu dengan perkantoran, sehingga sangat dekat bila memerlukan menarik cash dari atm bank manapun, tinggal turun ke lobby.",

Benar-benar fasilitas Bintang 5. Kamar yg besar dan ada kitchen sama mesin cuci-nya sangat cocok untuk staycation. Ada kolam renang dan gym yg bisa di pakai dari jam 6 pagi sampai 9 malem, pool-nya indoor jadi ga udah takut jadi item. Yang paling oke lagi, kecepatan internetnya sampai 25 mbps, bener2 cocok buat staycation sambil nonton atau donlot2, anti buffer!\n\nKebetulan saya menginap di saat ulang tahun, dan saya mendapat kejutan berupa birthday cake. Perhatian yg luar biasa dari The Mayflower, Good Job to take my respect and love to your great service \ud83d\ude02\n\nDari sarapan juga sangat memuaskan, karena sedang covid jadi tidak berbentuk buffet tapi ga masalah, karena kita bisa request makanan yg kita inginkan dan boleh pesan seberapa banyak yg kita ingin. Keren! \ud83d\udc4d\n\nIntinya, Stay untuk liburan dan bisnis di Mayflower adalah pilihan super terbaik menurut saya. Hotel yang bisa memberikan solusi perjalanan yang memuaskan! Sukses terus dan tetap jaga Your Best Service. Pasti saya akan menginap disini lagi, see you again \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

              "text": "Cek in tertulis jam 3, tp ternyata jam 2 sudah bs masuk. Love it! Utk hotel/apartemen bintang 5 lobby nya kurang wow ya, spt masuk ke perkantoran. Kurang sparkling dan ga ada wewangian khas hotel/premium apartment.\n\nStrong points menurut saya : kamarnya besar bikin 2 toddler betah lari-larian, bath up cukup besar utk saya dan anak kecil dua uwel2-an, air panas stabil, air di bath up dan walk in shower sungguh deras (loveeeee bgt! beda bgt dgn keran kecillll bgt di wastafel muka dan wastafel piring). Dari sisi request saya minta highfloor dan bath up dgn city view, yg diberikan hanya high floor di 31. Its okay, thank you! Ada JBL Horizon utk musik, diberikan scr free handsanitizer dan tisue basah. Cool!\n\nWeakness points : jalur/akses kurang jelas, apalagi utk pemula, kamar tidak wangi (but thanks when we're get in the ac is already on), linen tidak wangi (penting), toiletries tdk lengkap (mau minta keburu malas krn udh pengen selonjoran. Contoh tdk ada cotton bud, shower cap, sendal kurang, tisu refill tdk ada), selang air utk toilet (utk umumnya orangtua, khususnya yg bawa anak kecil spt saya, matters sih ketika anak poop hehe). Channel TV tdk menarik, dan kualitasnya buruk, malah jadi ga tertarik nonton sambil tiduran.\n\nOya krn terkait Covid-19 kolam renang tidak dpt digunakan dan breakfast di kafe (bukan restaurant) dgn kapasitas kira-kira 10 meja. Utk rasa, tidak istimewa (subyektif ya).\n\nSo overal lil bit under my expectation, but its oke tercover dgn keramahan para karyawannya. Thank you!",

Aman walopun musim hujan anak2 bisa tetap berenang, terlebih ada kolam jaccuzzi air hangatnya. Tidak ada life guard dikolam renangnya maka anak2 harus didampingi orang dewasa. Kami pilih 1 bedroom apartment yang ternya cukup luas. Baik living room, dining room kitchen area sampai kamar tidur dan kamar mandi.\nMakan pagi di The Caf\u00e8 sangat berkesan walaupun tidak begitu luas namun variasi menu sarapan sangat menyenangkan. Ditambah desain interior yang modern karena banyak expatriate yang tinggal disini.",

              "text": "Tinggal bersama keluarga selama hampir sepekan di apprt executive dengan dua kamar tidur.\n\nSebagai anggota Marriot  Reward, saya dan keluarga sangat puas tinggal disini.  Lokasinya strategis, dan kamarnya juga bagus.  Saya membaca beberap ulasan sebelumnya mengenai beberapa keluhan, namun saya bersyukur bahwa saya tidak mengalaminya.\n\nKamar kami keduanya nyaman dengan kualitas tempat tidur dan perabotan yang bagus.  Kalaupun ada sedikit keluhan adalah suara dari kegiatan konstruksi pembangunan gedung didepan bisa sedikit terdengar. Semua perabot dari kompor, mesin cuci dan pengering pakaian, exhaust fan, dan oven bekerja dengan baik.  Akan lebih baik kalau aliran air di wastafel tidak dibuat memancar sehingga air tidak terpercik keluar pada saat kita mencuci tangan.\n\nKualitas kamar mandi juga bagus dengan debit dan tekanan air yang cukup sehingga kami bis amandi dengan puas.  Amenities di kamar mandi juga bagus dan wangi dengan jumlah yang mencukupi.\n\nMakan pagi dibawah cukup enak, tetapi variasinya memang tidak sebanyak di hotel lainnya.  Namun para staff nya sangat ramah. Pilihan makanan di room service menunya juga sedikit terbatas.  Kami dua kali memesan room service, kebanyakan nasi dan rasanya enak.  Porsinya juga cukup banyak.\n\nKolam renang indoor tersedia di lantai 28.  Kami sangat menikmatinya.  Pada pagi hari kolam renang sepi sehingga kami nyaris menikmati kolam renang hanya untuk kami sekeluarga. Ada dua kolam air panas, dan kami sangat menyukainya. \n\nSebagaimana dikemukan reviewer lainnya, tempat makan di lantai bawah terbatas, dan tutup lebih awal atau pada akhir pekan. Solaria tidak menerima pesanan antar diatas jam 7 malam,  Untuk persediaan tersedia star mart yang menjual beberapa keperluan dan makanan ringan. Jika sedang malas keluar, banyak restoran yang menyedia kan pesan antar.",

Keluarga kami selalu disapa dengan hangat oleh semua orang yang bekerja di hotel ini. Tak ada apapun yang kami minta yang tidak dibantu oleh mereka. Sarapannya menyenangkan namun tidak berlebihan. Layanan kamarnya mencakup semua yang kami butuhkan. Apartemen eksekutif 2 kamar dengan jendela di atap menatap langit kota... WOW. Kami pulang ke kamar yang sudah dibersihkan dengan baik oleh staff... menakjubkan. Fasilitas (gym, kolam renang, jacuzzi) benar-benar indah. Duduk di dalam jacuzzi menghadap pemandangan kota merupakan sebuah pengalaman unik. Satu-satunya hal negatif adalah kami sedang berkemas untuk pergi. Sisi positifnya, kami akan mulai menabung lagi...untuk kembali. Hotelnya terletak di posisi sentral dan memberikan akses ke semua area utama. Terima kasih Marriot, Roville Loos.",

Any additional item just required a call to the housekeeping. The staff was very friendly and took personal care. The chef took special care and prepared Indian dishes on request. Special thanks to Irwan who gave lot of information on Jakarta and Indonesia and took great care. Thanks to Regina, Dinda, Prasilla, Krishnavathi, Panji, Liya, Aneesa and all the housekeeping staff.  The only feedback is that to make some changes in the breakfast menu, if not daily at least weekly",

The biggest shock for me was that they had several fluent Japanese speakers which I appreciated as I struggle speaking English. I was upgrade for free due to my Marriott member status which was extremely nice and the room was very large for me and my friend. The view and the amenities in the room were great and it was really like a home away from home. The pool and the jucuzzi, located on the 28th floor, was also exceptional and the view from the jacuzzi overlooking the city was amazing. I do have a few complaints, particularly in the room rate that I selected which was supposed to include a unlimited MRT pass however when I tried to use it, it didn't work and said insufficient funds. I didn't say anything because it wasn't a major deal for me. I also felt that the hotel overall had an outdated look much like an old Vegas hotel. While none of these issues are bad it was something took this stay from a 5 star to a 4 star. ",

It was pleasantly quiet at the tower during our weekend stay.\n\nIt is an outdated but still quite well maintained spacious apartment.\nWe love using the indoor swimming pool and whirlpool.\n\nMost of the staff showed good services and attitudes. They quickly delivered the international converter and knife to our room when we requested.\n\nThe breakfast room at 1st floor is small. Luckily our family still got the table, when we started for the breakfast by 8.00. The food is tasty, though the menu variation were relatively less compared to the other same standard accommodation.\n",

Later, CockroaXX appeared, so I changed the room to other room on the same floor. Although, water from water server included much white dust, and there were much dust on a floor and a desk. Also, there were ants walking on the bed, and a spider in a bathroom. I couldn't sleep with unpleasant. I needed to change again. The hotel staff were friendly, but need to be careful for the rooms on the 29th floor. ",

It gives me great pleasure that you enjoyed the location, spacious, clean and well-maintained units we have on offer. \n\nOur associates here are indeed our greatest strength and you're recognizing their efforts is the best compliment we can ever receive. All the associates are doing a wonderful job and we\u2019ll be sure to read your comments aloud and recognize them formally as well at our next associate awards ceremony,\n\nWe ensure that the food is made using the freshest produce to provide our customers with the best and it is unfortunate that we could not completely meet your expectations this time for breakfast. \n\nPlease accept my sincere apologies for the noise concern from Sudirman Street. We have rooms overlooking Kuningan and not facing the main road which are quieter. We will ensure that we have this on your profile and assign a quieter room for your next visit. \n\nWe value intuitive delivery service above all else and it is rather unfortunate that we failed to meet your expectations of the brand. I can assure you that my team and I are constantly refining our service delivery levels and sincerely hope to welcome you back and provide you with a more memorable experience!\n\nRegards,\nShashank Sinha\nGeneral Manager\n",

The hotel includes a restaurant, room service from the restaurant and optional grocery shopping service.  Note that the kitchen is equipped with very basic utensils and pots - difficult to cook a complex meal.  No microwave but there was a coffee maker, toaster and kettle.\n\nThe pool and work out area are very good.  The pool is larger than you would expect and there is an excellent children's pool.",

We are proud of the fact that our guestrooms are the largest in the city center and offer fabulous views of Sudirman and Kuningan. \nThe indoor swimming pool with Jacuzzi is perfect relaxation point for family.  \n\nIt is unfortunate that the kitchen pots and pans provided in the units did not meet your expectations, though we are very flexible and happy to provide with any additional request for any specifications of pots and pans for cooking. We do in fact have microwave and oven in the room and will touch base with my team to explain all the appliances to our valued guest. \n\nI am glad to know that service delivery did match your expectations of the Marriott assure you that you will leave us with a more delightful experience.\n\nRegards,\nShashank Sinha\nGeneral Manager\n",

I travelled a lot and stayed in numerous hotels throughout the world.  I stayed at the Mayflower, Jakarta, Marriott Executive Apartments for 4 nights and had to tip my hat off to the hotel staffs.  The entire staff was so attentive and helpful and more importantly, everyone wore a smile from security, to housekeeping, to front desk. I couldn't remember everyone's name but just to name a few in the front desk that I dealt with on a daily basis.  Kudos to Adinda, Putra, Art, Ratna, Aji, Irwin and of course their supervisor, Vinda.  They are so well trained, professional, and extremely friendly.  Like I mentioned, I stayed at so many hotels over the years.  The Mayflower, Jakarta has one of the best hotel staffs that I have ever experienced with.  Keep up the good work and will come back next time in Jakarta.",

If I had not found my own apartment, I would stay there again while I am in Jakarta for business.  \n\nThe people and management were very friendly and sensitive to my needs.  Whenever I needed anything, all I had to do was ask.  The cleaning crew was fantastic and made sure that my apartment was spotless every day and that I had everything I needed.  I used the spa a lot and they have a first class team running the spa, and their massage therapists were first class.  The gym was more than I needed.\n\nI loved the central location.  I could easily walk to work, but the staff was always helpful to get me a taxi whenever I needed it.\n\nThank you all at the Mayflower- Marriott Executive Apartments.  I appreciate all you did for me to make my stay as pleasant as possible.",

              "text": "The Mayflower - now primarily operated as Marriott Executive Apartments - is an Aparthotel for long-staying guests. The rooms are nice, bright and the furniture is in good condition. Yet the equipment should be checked better before guests check in. Some of the equipment we had was not suitable for a 5-star property anymore (some of it never was....). The Location is also good, as it lies between the central Business district and the most popular Shopping malls (Grand Indonesia, Plaza Indonesia).\nThe staff is friendly but not always effective. Sometimes lack of Feedback or language issues can cause Problems. Yet we had no Major issues during a whole month.\nBreakfast offers very limited Options. So you either prepare it for yourself in the kitchen of the room or you are happy with mainly local choices and limited assortment. Staff at the breakfast Restaurant is friendly and helpful.\nThe pool is a big disappointment. The pool is not heated and thus the temperature is quite low. Even after Swimming several rounds you dont seem to warm up in this - admittedly huge - pool. As a result the pool is hardly used by anyone. Only the Whirlpool has some guests now and then. In total it would make more sense to reduce the size of the pool and get it heated. And forget about pool-Service... You will find a menu but you would have to go looking for the staff to order.\nI had massages several times at the spa and the treatment was always good. The rooms - like several other parts of the Hotel - look outdated and not according to todays 5-star-standards. Also playing spa-music at convenient volume seems to pose a bit of a Problem (some rooms dont even have this Option). \nRoom Service was not convincing, when we had it. The taste was ok, but rather average. We preferred to cook ourselves then.\nWe were facing an unpleasant odour coming from the drain in the bathroom. Unfortunately this Problem could not be rectified during our stay and we had to use scented candles to deal with the bad smell. The bathroom also has only one handwash-basin. Thus if two persons Need to go to Office at the same time, it might get dense sometimes.\nAll in all we had a pleasant stay. Yet we do see potential for improvement in various points. ",

Highly recommended..People complain about the traffic, and yes there was some congestion , but we tried to travel in the off peak, and that was ok, and the taxis are cheap..after all this ia a major city, like London, New York, etc so the traffic will be busy..",

Commuting Around - Taking taxi back to hotel, you shouldnt mention The Mayflower Marriot Serviced Apartment because hardly anyone know about this place. Its better known as \"Indofood Tower\".\n\n3. Gym - The staircase to the gym is slippery at the edges od each steps. The friction patch should be pasted at the edges.\n\n4. Staff - All of the staff i have encountered were Helpful, Courteous  and Thoughtful. Pardon me as i forgotten to tip some of them who have assisted me 1 way or another.\n\n5. Comfort - My stay was very comfortable. Did not encounter any disturbance. Rooms were kept quite well. Maybe the cushions at the sofa should be washed frequently to raise the hygiene.\n\n6. Location - Well situated at the city centre area if you are on a business trip here.",

Thanks so much for taking the time to share your experience with us and detailed breakdown of the stay which does enable us to understand and make progress in each area. \n\nWe are indeed very strategically located right in the very heart of business district of Sudirman that proves to be very convenient with our guests. You could be glad to know that we are working on our presence in \u201cIndofood Tower\u201d building by having Marriott Executive Apartment Logo on the building which will further help us.\nWhile I am glad to hear that our team took such great care of you during your stay and you loved the spacious room, I will work hard with my House Keeping for cleaning check and maintain the international hygiene standards all the time. I am revisiting your points on the steps of gym and checking each anti-skid strips and ensure there is no concern there.\n\nLim F, once again thank you for the recommendation. We can't wait to welcoming you back soon!\n\nKind regards,\n\nShashank Sinha\nGeneral Manager\n",

The main reason I initially selected The Mayflower was the prime location along one of the main thoroughfares (Jalan Sudirman) in the CBD. Traffic congestion in Jakarta is an issue and being close by taxi or within walking distance of offices and malls makes the Mayflower a great location. As I quickly found out, however, the property had a lot more to offer than just a great location. The service at all levels was absolutely outstanding, I was made to feel extremely welcome and as a solo traveler I really felt at home. My deluxe one bedroom apartment room was very comfortable, quiet, clean with good amenities (kitchen and washing machine). The views from my room were great. WiFi was good. The gym was very well equipped with great views across the city. Breakfast choices were excellent with very attentive and friendly waiting staff. Room service menu choices were good and there are also a couple of eateries in the office building.",

The hotel is located in a business compound named Indofood Tower (not to mix it with the other Marriott). There is an Italian restaurant underneath, which was good for us...",

The Security warned me for my action. And when we need to go out to Setiabudi street I have to go out take another parking ticket just to make a u-turn to the other way out. Again, another Security Staff warned me for my action and we start to argue. Security staff just don't care what was happened and their group just kept warned me repeatedly without really listening my explanation, even in front of the Secure parking staff. To be straight forward we start to rise our voice and somehow I managed not to scolded them. Instead the Security team kept nagging my action.\nAt this point I'd better off and not arguing with this kind of Staff.\n\nIt is too bad for having this kind of Personnel working under Marriott standard. Just really a draw back and I think should be reviewed by Marriott management.",

It has a full kitchen and a washer/dryer. Linens and towels were fresh. Bathroom amenities were adequate. Lighting in the bathroom is a bit dim. A challenge when putting on make up. The reception staff are friendly and helpful. They made the check in/out process very convenient. The dining room staff are also helpful and accomodating. We were impressed with the massage service in the spa as well- professional and very good. We asked for help reserving a taxi to the airport for an early morning flight. Front desk staff made sure our taxi was on time and also packed a breakfast for us to take to the airport. Overall, service was consistently very good- always a smile, a warm welcome and willingness to help. ",

Starting from the security, front desk, coffee shop, house keeping, engineering and The Room, it was and it is, \"home away from home\". It's a shame that I don't remember the names, of the hotel associates who made my business stay (which can be boring) so memorable. But I would always remember their smiling faces, their warmth, their care and friendliness. They really uphold the brand name of the \"Marriotts\". I checked into the hotel with an expectation of world class experienced, and in every sense it was extraordinary, and all those 8 days I was on top of the world. A big and specials thanks to The GM, Mr. Shashank Sinha, and all his team members who made my stay a memorable one. \n\nTalking about top of the world.

The rooms are excellent and the facilities including the gym and the pool are world class. \nThe room service and the breakfast buffet is top notch as well. \nIt is in a building called Indofood and thus there are 2 grocery stores in the building. There is a 7/11 store near by. The hotel arranges for taxis and also a pick up from the airport. \nI have 0 complaints and I just love this place. I will be leaving though in 10-15 days... SIGH!",

Otherwise, the hotel's official entrance is around the back in the basement. My deluxe 1 bedroom was huge although the facilities are showing their age. There was a plasticky smell in their rooms, so just get them to open the window locks and aerate every day when you leave. There isn't much choice for food downstairs, but Plaza Indonesia / SCBD are 10 minutes away in good traffic, or you can walk 5 minutes to the BRT stop. Staff are very courteous, quick, and helpful, which more than made up for the minor furnishings issues. They even accompanied me to find a doctor and offered lighter breakfast foods later in the day.

The apartments are at the top of a office tower block and located from 28th to 36th floor. Reception and a small caf\u00e9 are at the ground level. The apartment itself was huge with two bedrooms, two bathrooms, large lounge and kitchen. More suited to a long term stay than a couple of nights but at a very reasonable cost compared to JW or Ritz Carlton. Breakfast selection was ok with egg station and freshly cooked noodle dishes",

And the little gourmet kitchen in our rooms gives that added advantage for our guest to try out some home recipe. \n\nOur central location does give the advantage to all our guests to commute and beat the traffic by using our alternative access to the hotel via Setiabudi. I am sure you found it convenient too. Lastly our staff our biggest strength and single biggest asset, they feel very motivated when they read such reviews and their recognition. I will surely pass all your compliments to the team and look forward of welcoming you soon to our property in your next visit to Jakarta.\n\nRegards,\nShashank\nGeneral Manager\n",

They come with practically all facilities, but being a long term stay place, do not expect quick services. The staff are extremely good and helpful. The breakfast menu is very limited and does not reflect an international Marriott collection. The best thing was they had a Indian Vegetarian section, Thanks to their GM, which helped vegetarians have good food [ atleast one item is there]. Overall good place, but you can opt for other Marriott properties as many are in town.",

And as a SPG gold member I expect some extra service.\nThe welcoming at Mayflower was nice, friendly, warm and as expected. \nThe room was huge, nice, a bit run down and a bit smelly. A bit nice, a bit not so nice.\nFirst I need to spray parfum to every room to make me feel comfortable.\nThe next day we talked to the staff about the very bad smell of the corridor (32. floor) and they dont understand which bad smell. The smell is so ugly, i covered my nose with my tshirt while walking from lift to room or room to lift.\nImprove please.\nOverall it\u00b4s nice, but for the same price I stay now behind the Mayflower at another Apartment Residence and I got much better Room, bigger, nice smell and more feel like at home.\nAt least it was a disappointing stay at Mayflower. and till now I didnt get my marriott points on my membership.",

Check-in was smooth and we were provided with the smoking room that we requested. The highlight of the night was definitely the kitchen. Everything was in working order. We cooked roasted chicken and it went well without any problem. Hot water, air conditioner, and room condition was well-maintained. Thank you for a lovely weekend.",

He went over and beyond to ensure that everything went perfect. \nStaff at the hotel mirror his attentiveness to guests especially Fitri from Front Office. Thank you for getting the travel adaptors and helping to baby proof the apartment. Another person was Hussin. He took care of my visits and excusions and went out of the way printing maps for the taxis and ensuring they knew the routes to take me and my family by. I really appreciated that. \n\nThank you everyone at The Mayflower. I have nothing negative to comment on. Its been a great 3 days.\n",

As my wife and I walked at of the lift I noticed there was a happy hour offering discount on beers, so decided we'd have a pre-dinner drink at the Mayflower Cafe. On sitting down we were warmly greeted and it was recommended we try the lamb curry, which was quite a reasonable price and something we don't get to eat often. To cut a long story short it was delicious and sufficient quantity to satisfy any hungry traveller. Washed down with cold beer, this mea was a treat, and the hospitality first class.",

              "text": "It's a good place to spend your weekend in Jakarta. We stayed here on the long weekend of Dec 8 to 11 2016.\nI'm in love with this hotel since I arrived. The staff were super friendly, especially the security who makes us feel safe after the security issues in Jakarta a couple of weeks ago.\nThe front desk staff were friendly, helpful, and very informative. They answered all my questions about the hotel facility and what to do in the city. The welcome drink and lite bite were a good idea, especially after spending 2,5 hours trapped in the traffic from the airport to the hotel.\nThe room was huge and comfortable. It feels like a home away from home. The kitchen set and washing machine is a nice addition compared to your usual hotel room.\nThe breakfast is simpler than other Marriott's hotel but they provide your daily breakfast needs with the best quality.\nFor sure I'll come back to this hotel when I visit Jakarta!!",

They put sound proof windows! :)\nThey have rooms headed to the main street-maybe will be more noisy OR headed to the setiabudi area-you can hear the sound of morning pray-call before 5am, i used my noise cancelling earphone then went back to sleep. \n\nLocated in the main street of Sudirman street, very convenient to travel to my meeting sites. I went through Setiabudi, Kuningan roads.\n\nThe apartment is huge, for a one-bedroom unit. The amenities are complete, even they have coffee maker, dishwasher (yes dishwasher, even i was wondering why thy have it since it's a service apartment-but not a complaint tho!)\n\nThe design is a bit old, and it looks a bit old, but everything well functioned. Fast response from the staff, and the egg Benedict-from in room dining is fantastic!\nNot a big fans of their breakfast area tho, very small and if you come in busy hour, you may need to wait till someone leave.\n\nSpa, swimming pool and gym are available, haven't use them yet, but it looks ok!\n\nThe staffs were so nice and attentive!\nMay come back again with noise cancelling earphone!

The food was creative and interesting as the Chef made a special ox tail stew with rice and sambal for me.  Something different and taste YUMMY!  Had the opportunity to stay in the rooms for 2 nights as well, i was very impressed with the space and the facilities included in this building.  The prices are real value for money and i would love to recommend all my friends who needs to visit Jakarta for leisure or tour to really consider this place as they make their rooms really cozy, very squeaky clean and super comfortable overlooking the beautiful city.  This place has everything you need and a great place away from home.  To top it off the GM is an amazing guy!  Well done!!!",

Mayflower provided a decent size apartment unit serviced daily, a generous breakfast, stylish and clean interiors. The kitchen had all amenities needed to cook. Internet connection was included in the room price, very high speed and supported several devices. Spa, pool and fitness center are of premium quality.

We had a small reunion in the apartment about 8 of us. So it was just perfect, the one bedroom apartment was very comfortable and spacious. Nice large queen size bed, clean and comfy. Clean bathroom. Just a minor thing in the bathroom. The powerpoint was not working so I had to use the hairdryer in the bedroom which do not have a mirror close by. \n\nMy friends brought some food for lunch that day. The hotel staff were very helpful in getting additional plates and cutlery to the apartment back and forth so many times without any problems as we wanted some other things for our little party. The view from my room was spectacular. I left my curtain open all night to enjoy the night skyline of Jakarta while reminiscing the times I spend growing up in this beautiful City. it was a memorable experience.",

              "text": "Stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment for 2 nights with colleagues.  View of the city was really good, even with the Jakarta haze.  \n\nApartment was super spacious, including two good size bedrooms with double beds and a master with a bed that seemed bigger than a normal king and walk in wardrobe.  Kitchen had everything you needed although a microwave would be handy, especially if you're living outside of home.  Two large bathrooms with separate showers and baths.  Big living area and dining table made for a space that would be easy to live in with a big group.\n\nSmall things which could be annoying - apartment was for up to 6 people, with 4 booked, but only 2 bottle of water were provided.  We called for more, not sure if we were charged.  Some of the rooms had a stale food kind of smell, which was unpleasant until we got used to it.  There were tiny ant bugs in the bathrooms which are yuck but I've seen them in offices and hotels elsewhere in south east Asia.  Check out took over 15 mins for them to check the minibar and whatever else they wanted to do.\n\nWhen I booked I was told breakfast would be extra but on arrival found out it was included, which was a great surprise.  There is a small breakfast selection but it included the things most travellers want the most - egg station, fresh cut fruit, toast, coffee, juice, etc.  We ordered room service one night and had to call after an hour, only to be told that they had a small kitchen and we had ordered a lot...\n\nBeds are pretty comfy.  Shower pressure fantastic.  Included amenities pretty good but half shampoo bottles are not a good look.  Internet was okay but a occasionally patchy.  \n\nService was almost always very friendly and polite.  It was disappointing that the master bedroom uber bed couldn't be changed for twin beds, even though that is what was in the pictures I was sent.  Check in was very friendly and included a welcome drink and cold towel.\n\nHotel was quite hard for some taxi drivers to find.  Some recognised 'Indofood building' but one driver went in circles for 30 minutes and we had to guide him using google maps.",

              "text": "I stayed for a weekend in town get away,  in 2 bedroom apartment with wife and 2 toddlers for 2 nights. The room itself is very good and comfortable. Plenty of common space but the bed room was rather small. We were placed on one of the rooms with view toward Jalan Sudirman, which is quite nice scenery in the night . \n\nThe kitchenette was well equipped and well maintained. Although for this level of property I would expect to see more premium coffee like Nespresso or Dolce Gusto, or Keurig machine, instead of cheap drip coffee machine, instant coffee and tea they provided. The room also equipped with washing machine with tumble dryer. I tried to use it once, but it was so noisy and it was installed on the hallway closet close to front door, that I afraid i was bothered other guests in nearby units. \n\nThe breakfast was kind of a downer. Very small place and limited options. I think the taste also not so glorious.\n\nThe hotel have a big indoor swimming pool and also Jacuzzi pool on one side of the pool. Also it have a kid's pool. The kids were enjoying the indoor pool. \n\nFor family with little kids I think this property is not a right choice, albeit the apartment itself is very nice and the staff was very warm.",

Of course at a Marriott you already have high expectations, but they were not only met, but outperformed with all the things on offer there (from the rooms including everything you might need, pool, spa, gym and so on). The chef and the F&B team surprised us every morning with an over complete breakfast (from all western breakfast dishes you can imagine to Asian and Indonesian delicatessen that helped us to explore the new country on a culinary level every morning). Last but not least the excellent and highly motivated Team and staff which made our first weeks really nice. Highly recommendable!",

Marriott Executive Apartment, The Mayflower, Jakarta had that fact and more. The one bedroom apartment was spacious (80sqm), competed with the usual 5-star hotel amenities and more such as fridge, stove, microwave, basic yet complete kitchenware, living/dining area, including washing machine and detergent. Hotel facilities were great too with indoor swimming pool, gym, sauna/steam, and jacuzzi (shared, located in the swimming pool area). The breakfast restaurant was very small with basic varieties; however, it wasn't a major issue since you can have your own freedom in your own kitchen.",

It is a very good time to spend while the lebaran is coming the distance from nearest mall grand Indonesia is actually walking distance . With all the fully kitchen equipment make our stay more convenient to cook Indonesian food.\nThey also have Indonesian buffet during weekday but unfortunately it was closed on lebaran day but it is okay we have own kitchen .\n\nAll the staff are very friendly specially reception which also work as a waiter they are everywhere. We noted that on the third day we stay , Mrs Euis, the manager on duty  give us a complimentary dadar gulung which my daughter are really like.\n\nShe even ask kitchen staff to prepare for us everyday. Dewi and Meli also another staff thay always deliver an exceptional services.\nOverall we are very happy and sure will always choose Mayflower as a great apartment to stay.\n\nLove love",

              "text": "I stayed at the Mayflower for over a month. It was in every way, a perfect stay. The apartment itself was spacious, well maintained and tastefully decorated. The living room and the bedroom were large, the kitchen was fully equipped and the bathroom was extremely spacious. They also provide a washer and dryer in the apartment itself, which is super convenient. They also provide daily cleaning services, and the housekeeping staff is very friendly and accommodates all of your needs. The front desk staff were exceptional - they helped me out several times with taxi booking, local language translation and made sure that my every need was taken care of. I also used the gym and the swimming pool regularly - both are very well maintained and spacious, so it never feels crowded. These apartments are also located in an upscale part of Central Jakarta - one of Jakarta's best malls is a 20 minute walk away, and there are several eateries around the building. All in all, my apartment felt like home and I really grew to appreciate the staff there. Would HIGHLY recommend this gem of a property to anyone who's looking for a comfortable short term or long term stay in Jakarta.",

The service level has impressed my friends and myself the moment we stepped in. \n\nLocation\n10 mins taxi ride away (with no jam) to Grand Indonesia, Plaza Indonesia and Pacific Place.\n\nSecurity\nTypical of hotels in Jakarta but done in a very polite and professional way all the time. Security staff even assisted to press the lift button for you and on two occasions, offered their help without being asked when they saw that I had issues with my room card.\n\nReception\nThe best front desk team I have met, regardless of the day or night team. Besides being address by the last name, probably because of the numerous occasions I called for their assistance. Check-in was smooth and fast and we got an upgrade to the executive apartment. The front desk staff brought us to the room personally and did some explanation of the room. The front desk also recommended us the various dining options around the area. \n\nWhen called upon for assistance (additional robes, towels, etc), requests were seen to it immediately and we got the items and assistance within 10 minutes. On the last night of our stay, we sought their assistance to order KFC for us and needless to say, they helped us placed the order and took the trouble to send the food up to our room. As staff of Marriott, they did try to offer us the room service option but was never pushy when we chose otherwise. \n\nRoom\nBig and comfortable bed!\n\nHousekeeping Team\nKept the rooms tidy and clean. Good job!\n\nCafe Team\nPolite and attentive to clear the plates and offered us the various beverage options even when we did not ask for it. \n\nGym & Spa Team\nAnother polite team!\n\nThis is one impressive team who are always ready to assist (be it taxi or room items). This Marriott team deserves the due recognition.\n\nThank you for taking good care of us and we wish you well. Will definitely recommend my friends to stay with The Mayflower when they visit Jakarta.",

The apartment is old and most of things in the room (3006) are not functioning properly or not working at all, staff are not professional, cleanness is not satisfactory, electric kettle is disgusting old/smell (I took pictures of kettle just for verification). I stopped complaining after four complains. In my opinion the hotel is not good value for money compared to others in Jakarta for the amount of money I paid which considered a special offer from booking.com and will never go back again if have to pay the same amount or higher for this standard.",

I used the gym and enjoyed it (bring your runners if you want to use the gym facilities). The chlorine pool is large.  The rooms are a bit quirky. It was hard to find an electrical outlet where I could plug in my computer, for example, and then I had to charge my computer and my phone alternately because I couldn't do both at the same time. The light switches were in odd places. The shower door leaked.  It was handy to have a washing machine in the room -- but nowhere to hang the clothes if you don't want to use the dryer. The restaurant was so-so. Be warned that they use MSG.",

Sound-proofing was very good (the mosques begin amplified calls to prayer at abt 4:40am). Gym/spa was nice--clean and spacious. Breakfast and lunch buffets were good and a good value. Building had a few other restaurants and a Coffee Bean but no adjacent mall. I liked that this hotel was smaller and quieter than the mega-hotels surrounding Plaza Indonesia or in Kuningan, but still close to everything.",

What I particularly like about these apartments is their size, kitchen and the high ceilings. I've stayed in 2 bedroom and 1 bedroom apartments and both were adequately furnished and serviced. The residences offers great fitness and food options. For fitness, it has a spa (good masseuse), and sauna and steam room, 25 m indoor swimming pool with 4 comfortable lanes, big gym and other options like yoga etc on some days of the week. Food is a decent spread of both western and eastern cuisines and 24hr room service menu too. The staff and especially the general manager are very courteous and make every effort to make their short and long term guests feel at home. The residence is close to all the new fancy malls both up and down the road. Within the complex, you have ATM, food (Japanese restaurant is particularly good) and 7/11 kinda store too. \nDon't think twice for booking this place. You'll enjoy the comfort, service and feel at home. ",

Checked in at 6AM and the front desk rep was very much attentive, full of energy etc while obviously i was the opposite after taking the red eye flight from HKG.  The place is a bit dated and probably needs some TLC to \"modernize\" the feel.  The rooms were pretty big and comfortable.  Breakfast was nothing special but can fill you up.  It was also good that the care service Silverbird was able to just charge my ground transportation to the room charge.  I gave this \"very good\" rather than average because of the people...all smiles, very attentive and warm.",

Perfect place if you want the comfort of a hotel and at the same time the privacy and flexibility of your own apartment. The location is very central in Jakarta, however you do need either a car or a taxi to move around. There are no shops or restaurants on walking distance from the apartments. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly, especially the front office is doing their outmost to make your stay as comfortable as possible. All in all, I can only recommend the Mayflower in Jakarta.",

The breakfast restaurant was very good offering a large selection of well cooked options, again equal to any 5 star. Only downside I can think of is that it doesn't have a large choice of amenities, shops restaurants etc walking distance.",

It took a long time for that matter, in addition, the aircon in second bedroom isnt cold enough. We had technician fixing them but he couldnt! In the evening i called again to the manager and the manager offered to change rooms. However, the room isnt cold either! He explained to us that all 2BR apartments second room ACs are like that. He offered to split us to 2 1BR apartment. The AC problem solved. In one of the new room, the phone was broken, we didnt really care as we dont use them anyway. But once again we need the technician to fix them. The hotel feels old and need some fixing, our 2BR was the worst, the pillow cover was stained, they gave us only 2 bottles of water for 4 pple stay. Mom argued and they gave us extra 2 bottles. Another feedback is the housekeeping didnt refill our amenities daily. Overall the hotel is nice and good value but there are things that needs improvement",

I have been upgraded to other one bedroom suites that have bigger bathrooms and bedrooms and being at the end of the building do offer better views to the north or the south.\n\nThe beds are comfortable, and a good sized desk and chair are provided in  the bedroom as a working area. Having a separate bedroom form the living area is nice, especially for an extended stay as you don't feel as cramped.\n\nThe complex has an indoor pool and a gym on the 28th floor that is reasonable well equipped with a range of cardio and weight machines. The 28th floor also has a spa and massage facility.\n\nThe restaurant provides a great breakfast with a selection of western and asian foods. Room service is quick and good quality at a reasonable price and provides an easy alternative if getting back from the office later in  the evening.\n\nThe location, on JL Surdiman is handy to major shopping malls such as Plaza Indonesia, Grand Indonesia and Pacific Place so there is a large range of options for eating out or getting a drink.\n\nAll the staff from the front desk, restaurant, kitchen, housekeeping and security want to provide the best service at all times, they are all friendly and approachable, and can't do enough to help. They really make the difference to your stay over a period of weeks.",

There is a gym & spa centre within. The bedrooms & living room are well spaced. Adjoining is a well equipped kitchenette. The only draw back is there is no charging power points in the bedrooms except at the bathroom walls for blow dryer. So considering a use of laptop or charging cellphone could only be done at the living room. Overall is a pleasant & comfortable stay.",

There are no amenities in the area other than a local small minimart at the lobby and 3 restaurants shared in the Indofood office tower. Getting a taxi is a pain as the main road is clogged and you have to fight with the office crowd to get one. The hotel is able to get you one, but that would set you back by another 15mins and they are also fully capable for screwing it up. \n\nStaffs are undertrained and often have no clue how to deal with request other than check-in and out. As i have stayed in the hotel multiple times, no more than 3 gadgets are allowed internet access and with that, it choked the system as it remembered me with my gadgets. Calling the frontdesk gets you a number to call the Philippines helpdesk who spends the first 10mins to verify your identity and next 30mins to open 1 extra access to your gadget. And the frontdesk is incapable of helping you any further.\n\nFor 2 stays, i had major problems with the shower. On 1 stay, i had to stay 7 nights and everyday the shower had No hot water and everyday i have to call somebody to fix it and everytime they tell me its fixed and the cycle continues. Jakarta is hot but the AC in the building is cold, so you don't want to shower cold. On another stay, the shower had no pressure, and it is the same thing, you call, they come, they fix, shower, no pressure. \n\nNow we come to breakfast...lets not talk about it. \nThe traffic is a pain but you get over it. To deal with the traffic, day's work, this hotel, our complicated relationship is over. I recommend JW Marriot if you are Marriot's member, Intercont, maybe Mulia.",

Staff is unprofessional, inattentive, appliances - like cooler, air conditioning are not working, awful smell at times, dirty napkins at breakfast, dirty bed linens, also they have started to clean the rooms more or less OK only after multiple reminders and then ultimately a big scandal I have organized, still can not wash the dishes properly. Management is a disaster also, absolutely inattentive to requests and complaints. My company paid a long-term rent and cannot cancel it, so Marriott management is just laughing at all the problems. Awful, disaster, just do not go there!!!",

My family always choose this apartment because the price is reasonable and we are happy with the big space that they are offering. Though I have to admit that the room will need renovation soon because it looks a bit worn out and their breakfast menus needs to be improved.\n\nHowever, during my last visit there, I experienced something unusual. Soon after I arrived at the apartment (in the evening), I did the check in at the reception. Nothing's weird with the check in. Few moments later (I was still at the reception) the people at the reception asked me if I have knife on one of my suitcase. I asked my mother and she said \"Yes\". So I relayed her answer to the reception and asked on what seems to be the problem.\nThey said that the knife can't enter the room. And when i asked for the reason, they only said \"the hotel's policy\". I find this is weird. And the reception said this \" we provide full set of knife inside the room. Just leave your knife with us and you can take it when you are checking out\". I disagree with their terms, leave their reception and asked the concierge to deliver my luggages since I got one baby with us and he started to get annoyed because their reception-lobby was a bit hot.\nAnd guess what ? They send it right away.\nSo, really what's the fuss about the knife after all ? I tried to ask their management using their twitter account and they answered that they will have someone to follow up my report. But no one came.\n\nApart from this annoying incident, I can still recommend this place to stay. Especially if you are with one big family.",

Just be sure not to be there once the road is opened again for traffic.\n\nStaffs are friendly and if you stay long enough, remember about all your preferences making your stay all the more enjoyable. \n\nBreakfast is average while the gym is great.",

              "text": "I stayed for more than three (3) months at this lovely American hotel (serviced apt) in downtown Jakarta. The hotel is in Indofood tower. The modern room is well appointed and impressive. There are full kitchen, fridge, spacious living room, two wide screen TV, and a walk in closet. The floor of the living room is marble. The bathroom is all marble. View from the room is very beautiful. Location is perfect in Sudirman which is the best location to efficiently travel to southern and northern Jakarta via toll road, even to Airport and Bandung. Price slightly cheaper than Oakwood, but the location and quality is far better. Beating Jakarta traffic is a must. There is a Silverbird taxi station at the entrance which I use twice a day because of the excellent value  for money, just make sure to ask for E class Mercedes or Alphard car. There is a enormous indoor swimming pool. The fitness center is spacious but standard. The view from the pool and fitness center is very beautiful. There is many ATM machines on ground floor for local currency. Two prestigious malls the Plaza Senayan and Grand Indonesia are the best place nearby to eat. The hotel staffs are very courteous and helpful. If only other Marriott in the US has similar standard. This hotel is much better than other category 2 Marriott hotel in the US. I would stay here again when I visit Jakarta. I am an Starwood SPG member but for Jakarta I choose this hotel. Excellent value for the money.",

              "text": "As a long time international business traveler (also SPG Platinum and Radisson Gold), I have had my fair share of hotel rooms. I usually stick with business hotels from international chains as they have standard service levels and mostly I am happy with.\n\nMy Marriott Executive Apt. stay was in my second trip in Jakarta. In my first visit, I stayed in Le Meridien located less than half a mile down the road. I hated to walk even that distance because of heat, smog and crowd at peak hours. This time, our local office gave me two options. First one is Intercontinental which is literally next building from my office and Marriott Exec.Apt which is across the street. In my fourth week in Southeast Asia, feeling a little like home with full kitchen, living room and a separate bedroom sounded like a great idea for slightly more than what I would pay for a regular hotel room. After all this is Marriott, how bad it could be? \n\nBoy I was wrong... I quickly realized service and quality was not comparable and part of the reason why is that this property is sharing the building with other offices. Although it has a separate lobby, the limited amount of space makes common areas small and I figured it might be contributing to maintenance issues. \n\nUpon uneventful check in, I got into my 30th floor apartment. Apartment was a good size long and narrow one bedroom with a separate laundry. It looked clean and modern except that it had a very slight odd smell. I was tired and liked what I have seen so I stayed. The first problem started after i tried to log on wifi. It took me multiple attempts to connect to the router but I was able to at the end. The second problem started when I wanted to connect with my phone. Upon multiple attempts, I was again able to connect but then concluded internet connection clearly has a problem which was confirmed after my laptop connection dropped. At this point, I decided to call the front desk. Front desk manager politely informed me that their technical service desk is not working on weekend (!) and I told her I am on a business trip and need reliable internet connection. She offered to come upstairs and take a look. After 10 minutes of her working on my laptop, I was back online. Himm, ok, I lost about an hour but still... \n\nThe next morning, I woke up to a bad smell coming out of bathroom. Took a shower, which leaked water in the middle of the bathroom despite closed shower door. I was sure I was not the first person seeing water on bathroom floor but a little surprised the water and drainage were quite far from each other. Besides there was no angle so I had to swipe my little pond with towels which took me to the source of bad smell: Drainage. At that point, I took a careful look at the bathroom, the quality of the work, materials etc were terrible. Uneven edges, molded grout, plastic shower head, non sealing shower door etc. Called front desk, told them the problem and went out. \n\nThe next two days, the bad smell was not there but room still had some odor and my connection problem was back. Called front desk manager and asked for the IT guy this time. They came together and supposedly fixed it. After that I still had connection problems but it was better than before.\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday I had buffet breakfast at the small restaurant next to lobby. Food selection was very very limited and nothing comparable to full service hotels. I had already decided to never come back again due to internet and stinking bathroom and breakfast sealed my decision but it was not over. On Monday morning, there was simply no empty table in the tiny restaurant. I had to wait for someone to finish. Frustrating. Wednesday morning bad smell came back. I thought it was fixed. It was again coming out of drainage and my theory is it happens when someone above or below me is taking a dump. Otherwise it would not be intermittent. I went down and ask for director of rooms or general manager and neither was in property. Operations manager came out of office, listened to my problem and told me it will be fixed today. In the evening, I came back and saw the sophisticated (!) fix which is blocking the drainage with aluminium foil. Good news is smell was gone, bad news is there is no way for water to exit. Brilliant. \n\nIn my first day, had seen %20 off for SPA and decided to try it out. I went down to 28th floor, saw excellent pool and nice gym. The spa was next to the gym, nice, clean rooms. I was happy to relax and ready to fall into sleep during my 90 minutes massage only to jump up my seat after I heard a very loud music and screaming people. I asked for the SPA associate and asked whats going on. He told me a group rented the gym for a workout session! Worse, since they paid for it, they will stay. Hotel is renting the gym to obviously noisy event next to their spa!!! I told them this was unacceptable and they offered me to go to a different room. I changed to more silent room but i lost my mood already. \n\nI am no difficult customer and don't write reviews as I have received consistently standard service from all big chains but my experience with this property was entirely different. If you value quality over quantity, I recommend to go to a traditional hotel. This property might be suitable for big families with kids but not for me. This is not a hotel for a business traveler. As for the staff, it would be unfair to slam them as these are beyond their control. I always told my friends if I ever own a hotel, all my staff will be Indonesian. They are the most hospitable people on earth and these guys are no exception. It is sad that they work for this property.",

              "text": "Mariott Hotel  executive  apartment  hotel in Jakarta is  situated  the central area and  it is well located if you neeed to be close to financial district . I selected this Apartment Hotel  as I was in Jakarta for business and as it said, on web site, it has a very nice and well equipped fitness  area. I confirm the fitness area  it is very very nice, and if you are into heavy body building You can accommodate a very proper training session as the gym is fully catered  with Life fitness brand  equipment. The cardio area is also super  well equipped. The gym is on two floor and it is very large, quite, clean.All you need for a good session and more. At lower  floor , 28th floor,  there is a very large pool, with kids pool too. At second floor, 29th floor is located the gym with a breathtaking view of city skyline. Apart from a beautiful gym I can not express a positive opinion. I was assigned a two rooms apartment, yes very large and spacious, with two bedrooms, and two bathrooms, but  all and all the fitting looks very old and the apartment would need to be refurbished. Thery are clean though. There is only one \u201c restaurant \u201c, if so We may call it,  which is located at ground floor, and which is very very small to cater such a large Hotel apartment block. So in the morning, if you want  to have breakfast, take into consideration it will take some time to be served. The selection of food is   limited, there are no cold cuts and little European style food. For instance there is not a water bowl in the restaurant, so if you want just a glass of water , you need to ask the waiter that takes times  minuts to serve you. I also had a diner in the \" restaurant\" first night at arrival, and it was just ok. As per the other service, like housekeeping,  I should mention my laundry was delivered to my room late at night, at 9.00 o\u2019clock pm, when all restaurant in Jakarta are closed, so I went out  for diner with client with same shirt I had on all day. Not nice!  In addition to that the set of terry towles  is limited to one piece peer size , even if in the apartment there are two bathrooms there was one set of  terry  towels just in main bathroom and limited, as I said to one piece per size. I called housekeeping for another  2 pieces  of terry pieces and It took 4= minuts to be delivered in my room. All and all I am disappointed. I paid 150  USA dollars per night, which is a lot of money in Jakarta, and I must say I paid for what  I did not get: the service, the morning breakfast and the restaurant do not really work, they need to be refurbished, they need to fix air conditioning as temperature inbreakfast lounge is far too hot. my apartment was old and  looked very \u201c empty\u201d and not cosy at all. The level of service is  poor, and the only positive things in this apartment hotel is the great GYM at 28th floor. I will not come back in Jakarta and I would not suggest to other business travelers.",

Usually I would stay at the Doubletree in Menteng area which is close to the CBD and good malls in Jakarta.\nCheck-in was smooth but that was the last of it.\nUpon check-in, I couldn't get the lights and other things to work. Only the air-con was working. Called 3x for the engineers to come and fix it but I had to leave for a meeting. Upon return, I noticed that the wall keycard-holder had been somewhat fixed with a new keycard. Wanted to take a shower but the hot water didn't work. Again, called the engineering dept with no success. Went downstairs to inform the front desk as I had to leave for a dinner meeting. Came back and noticed the hot water still didn't work.\n\nI gave up as I was too tired and took cold shower for the night and the morning after.\n\nThe kettle and kitchen stuff looked to be 20 years old. Can't imagine how much bacterias are in this room.\n\nWent to check out and was informed that the Silverbird taxi is waiting to take me to the airport. Rushed down and the bell boy just looked at me puzzled. Sure enough, no one informed him or the taxi driver.\n\nI can only say that I will NEVER return to this place.\n\nI don't know what kind of country manager that the Marriott Group hired for Indonesia to agree to accept this place as one of their own.",

We booked our room through hotels.com and as always, Indonesian services are not so pleasant whenever a third party is involved. We booked 3 rooms under 3 different names, we were informed by hotels.com that all our bookings have been confirmed. It shouldn't take us more than 10mins to get our rooms - we were so dead tired after the whole wedding ordeal.\nWhen we told them that we have 3 bookings, the 1st (guy) reception told us only 2 rooms were booked and that they didn't receive the other booking. We insisted that there are 3 bookings, that guy didn't do much to help us at all, and I, the bride, almost lost my temper. Thank God another reception came in and called their superior and tried to solve the problem.\nAfter this guy look at the booking sheets again, HE DID FOUND THE 3RD BOOKING NAME (after he unproffesionally insisted there was no 3rd booking) - though it somehow didn't get registered to their system.\n\nIn the end we waited at the lobby for 30-45 minutes, with sore legs and lack of sleep. Only the bed, warm shower and my family made things worth while\n",

The jury is still out on that question!\n\nGood location in terms of getting to many of the key business areas.  Apartments are very spacious, if in need of an up-grade and refurbishment.  They are somewhat old-fashioned in look and feel.\n\nVery attentive staff.  All very polite and helpful.\n\nThe in-house catering leaves a bit to be desired.  Breakfast spread was not up to the Marriott brand's usual standard.  I ate dinner in on one occassion and the food served was just so-so.\n\nThe location seemingly isn't that well known to taxi drivers.  So I'd advise anyone to print off a clear map before going and while based there.  There's not a lot to do within the building or within easy walking distance - in terms of alternative restaurants, bars, etc.\n\nOverall, I'd say it's decent value for money.",

The rooms are big and for some the kitchen facilities may be of value. The property would certainly benefit from an upgrade, as other guests noted it looks a bit tired and run down. No rainshower in the bathroom and toilet not stopping to drip.\nCheck out was more painful. USD Rate gets converted at expensive hotel conversion rate (>5% over bank rate) into IDR. Payment in US dollars only possible in cash. I wish they would stop this stupid practice of trying to squeeze a few more dollars out of you and raise their rate by $5. It just feels cheap and leaves a bad taste when a 4 star property has to resort to such means.\nBreakfast is nothing to write home about. Coffee was nice enough but sausages and potato slices cold, not much choice.",

Great if staying with others...a bit boring on your own, as no bar as such and restaurant is small and quiet.  Staff very friendly and attentive in restaurant and reception.  Overt (but not OTT) security in the lobby.  Pool was great (a bit cold!) & gym had plenty of aerobic stuff and free weights all in good condition. Food was tasty.  Apartment (1 bedroom) large, comfortable and pretty modern with 2 flat screen TVs, stereo, dvd player, & full kitchen / washing facilities.  I agree that more (any) accessible plug points for guests is required in the rooms.  MEGA building projects behind the Indofood Tower make for an 'interesting view' from the apartment!  Great location though, in heart of business district.  Would i stay again?  Yes if travelling with others (maybe), but probably no if solo - mainly due to being a little lifeless / quiet.",

It makes no pretenses about being an apartment...although far from an executive feel.\n\nThe room has certainly been lived-in. It looks a bit tired from the wear and tear. Nothing \"executive\" about it. \n\nIt took forever for the houekeeping to send up a shirt.  Though I have to stay that the staff (David) at the Cafe was quite attentive and most helpful.\n\nThe photos on the website are much, much better than the real thing. As a rule, I think properties should include the dates when published photos were taken. But i guess that's what we tripadvisor-zens are supposed to do...to be the voice of reality in an otherwise glamorized world of corporate PR.  It would be good though if hotels kept themselves honest.\n\nConstruction work of the MRT in Jakarta also makes access to the Mayflower challenging, to say the least.",

It offered great corner room in the executive floor, great view of Jakarta and most excellent service by the staff.   Very courteous and always ready to help.   \n\nRoom 3507 offered excellent view of the city.    Huge living room, full size kitchen, huge bedroom and 1.5 bathroom.   Has a combined washer and dryer, though the dryer doesn't dry well.   \n\nPros: value for the money, service, easy access, quiet\nSlight Cons: located in a major thoroughfare, so expect traffic jams anytime except between 10pm and 5am, have to travel by taxi if you don't plan to cook and want to eat",

              "text": "Compared to several other service apartments in Jakarta, The Marriott Mayflower is very expensive. If money is not an issue, it's worth it to stay there. I stayed in a two bedroom apartment. The apartment is very spacious with a very nice big kitchen. The view was also great. \nThe master bedroom has an ensuite large bathroom with modern amenities. The second bedroom was also quite big, the second bathroom was also quite big. It has a good washing machine with a dryer function too. The kitchen utensils, dishes and cutleries were quite good. They even provided basic needs for free such as cooking oil, washing powder, etc. on request. \nThe disadvantages were that it's very difficult to get in to the apartment. The security checks were a few times which was not very practical for long staying guests. It's located in the business area. In the evening, when offices were already closed, the restaurants downstairs were closed too. It's not easy to find restaurants nearby within walking distance. You always have to go by car. \nThe internet connection is not free and quite expensive.",

Would not say the location is gd but near enough to the Central where major malls are. By taxi it will cost you around Rp18K and Senayan about Rp20K. We did not take w breakfast as the hotel charge very exp. Plus this apartment located adjacent to office building where you can get food easily like Coffee Bean and 3 other local restaurants (but unfortunately the restaurants close on weekend). The apartment will be half full on weekend too (as it caters for business traveler\n\nThe lacking of this hotel; it provides basic toliteries - no toothbrush and paste, towel limited and only soap bar. unlike most hotels will provide complete set. Staff could not give proper info at times eg We plan to go Ancol ( the Jakarta Famous family Recreation Park) We get them to arrange for a taxi since it about 1hr drive. But when we arrived the place at 10am it was closed and only open in afternoon at 1.30pm. So we have to wait for more than 3hrs. The staff should have checked the info first when arranging the transport and advice us accordingly.\n\nThe gym, swimming pool and steam room are gd. Again if you go after office hrs it tend to be more crowded as the office ppl will use the facility also. This hotel is very quite on weekends and u see less ppl.",

It was a smart choice given our family size as we have a separate bedroom from our kids. The apartment was very serviceable, although we requested a different washer/dryer combo as the old one didn't dry. There is a breakfast buffet, but it has very little and not too impressive, as is the food ordered for room service. The pool is gorgeous tho as is the fitness centre. An amazing view 28 stories up. Love the amenities there. No problem with Internet for us but it is a modest additional charge. The lobby and entrance is through an office building, which is odd. We were also very surprised at the metal detectors and xray machines, but because of bombings, we've come to realize that it is a fact of life in Jakarta.",

What a terrible mistake it was.\n\nMy bad experience started when I checked into my apartment. Internet connection was not working, and kitchen appliances, especially the dishwasher, was filthy. A week into my stay here, the aircon broke down and instead of proactively informing me that there was a problem and providing me with an alternative solution, they waited until I called, three times, to tell me that something somewhere was leaking and they couldn't find it. The service and competence of the duty manager was appalling, and those of the hotel manager was the worst I've seen so far. \n\nThis place is a perfect example of over-promising and under-delivering.",

During that stay, everything is quite good except the slow service and issue of carpark that later settled after we asked to meet the supervisor (ended up the staff just lazy to do a little bit of work and just say that the service is not possible). The second time, we somehow still consider to stay over there again in 3 bedroom apartments, we have made reservation few months ahead to make sure the rooms are available. Today I was calling to find out regarding kitchen utility details and just found out that my name was not reserved at all. I was so disappointed to find out about it now and I was not contacted regarding the unavailability of the room eventhough my credit card is registered by them. The staff ask if they could help me to booked again today. I thought I would give them a chance again and make a reservation again as the staff said that there are 2 bedrooms apartments that are still available. few hours after that... I was contacted that the 2 bedrooms are also unavailable and if I would like, I am going to be placed in waiting list instead. \nThey should have apologized regarding their first mistake & instead of fixing it, they create another mistake and disappointment to their customers.\nI was VERY disappointed with Mayflower service.",

Good reception despite a bit slow.\nRooms are clean, huge (esp the executive 2-bdrm) and well-equiped. Very friendly service in the rooms.\nCareful, room service is disgusting though but plenty of food in the area. \nView from the rooms and the pool is stunning.\nSwimming pool is very nice too.

Had  a great tasty dinner. And i really meant this because not everyday we had such delicious food. Average food yes, but this is really tasty. We had the nasi madura package. And the desserts, which was the kueh were amazing to compliment it. I forgot the staff who clear up the dinner, thank you so much pak for being very nice and attentive. He noticed we could not finish the dessert/kueh and offered to bring some take away boxes. Once again, thank you for your great hospitality and have blessful Ramadhan for all of you. ",

Also close to a large shopping center.\n\nI really like the indoor pool which is on the 28th floor. The pool is very big, complete with hot and cold whirlpool. There is also a sauna and steam room. The gym room is also very spacious.\n\nThe room I stayed in was a 2 bed room unit, very spacious and comfortable. Complete with dining area, fully equipped kitchen, Living area. The main bedroom has an en suite bathroom complete with a bathtub with a cityscape view.\n\nFor breakfast the menu is very diverse. The Cafe also serves lunch and dinner with quite a variety of ala carte menus. I also tried live cooking in the room. Chef Rangga who serves food very well. We can also ask a lot about the food menus that are served.\n\nAll the staff here are very friendly and helpful in every way. It's really nice to stay here",

I had many flight delays and had to change the reservations few times. But the hotel team still managed to accommodate our request and provide the best service with clear communication. Everything was so smooth from the reservations, airport pick-up, registration, and the staffs were so welcoming and accommodating. The room was impeccable, spacious and clean. The food was tasty and delivered in a very hygienic manner. \nWe originally booked for 3 days/ 2 nights quarantine but before we arrived, the government changed the regulations to 2 days/ 1 night stay for those who already completed booster vaccine. The hotel immediately informed us and modify our reservations, they were honest and didn\u2019t try to rip us off or make us stay more. I really appreciate this gesture. \nThank you so much!",

              "text": "I am a Marriott Bonvoy Gold level member and booked this hotel for a quarantine package based on reviews here, as well as the Marriott site.  \n\nThe staff here has an excellent attitude and try to be accommodating.  \n\nI arrived by taxi from the airport after completing the Covid entry protocols.  Check-in was handled in my room and was efficient.  \n\nI booked a \"One Bedroom Superior\" room, which was about 90 sq meters.  There was a main/common room that had the washing machine, kitchenette, table for 4, and TV area with seating for 4-5 people.  A door way in the between the kitchenette and dining table area led to the bedroom.  Inside the bedroom, there was a king size bed, TV, work desk, and bathroom/closet area.  If you have guests, they have to go thru the bedroom to get to the bathroom.   \n\nUpon entering the room, it was immediately apparent that the photos on Marriott's website are VERY old.  The room is dated and worn down in every aspect.  Wood flooring is squeaky and warping, especially below the windows and at the entry to the bathroom.  The kitchenette is minimally equipped and not suitable for cooking anything other than the most basic of meals.  \n\nThe furnishings in the main room room are of low grade commercial quality.  They look OK in photos, but were not made for normal day to day home use.  The bedroom was equipped with similar low grade furnishings and a bed with a worn out mattress.  There was a bad attempt to update the closet area that is between the bedroom and the bathroom.  The materials are a totally different color and don't make efficient use of this space.  There was no place to put a medium to large suitcase like you find in most hotel rooms.  \n\nThe bathroom has a sink, shower, and separate bathtub.  In the photos, it look nice.  In reality, the wooden trays in the sink area are cracked and broken and there was a drain next to the toilet that had water coming up out of it every time I flushed the toilet.  Pretty gross.  \n\nI was there for 3 days and 2 nights.  Never was able to get hot water in the shower, sink or bathtub.  Lukewarm at best - and that was only possible if you didn't turn on any cold water.  \n\nThe quarantine menu  looked decent, but EVERY meal was served cold.  The box it was served in felt warm, but even after complaining, I was still served cold meals.  The food was bland, with the meat and veggies overcooked.  Unlike my quarantine stay at the Shangri-La Jakarta, eating utensils, napkins, salt, and pepper were NOT provided with each meal.  Breakfast was served with coffee and orange juice, but no drinks were offered with lunch or dinner.  you can't order outside food/drinks - so I'm not sure why no drinks came with lunch or dinner - but for the package price, this was not expected.  When I asked why meals came with no utensils, I was told there were utensils in the room - and there are.  But you have to wash them after every meal.  Again, for the quarantine package price, this is ridiculous.  \n\nThe air conditioning was noisy and it was hard to control the temperature.  There were separate controls for the main room and the bedroom, but it was either too cold or too hot.  It was impossible to set a comfortable temperature.  \n\nMy room faced the street and significant road noise could be heard around the clock.  I have stayed at other hotels in Jakarta (Mulia, Crowne Plaza, Shangri-La) with rooms facing the street and not heard the level of road noise I experienced here at the Mayflower.  \n\nMarriott Bonvoy members take note - While this is a \"Marriott\", they only give 2.5 points per dollar vs 10 points per dollar at \"regular\" Marriott properties.  They told me this was because they are \"an apartment, not a hotel\".  The room rates are similar to a hotel - so if points matter to you, you might want to explore Marriott's other properties in the the area.  \n\nWhat makes this experience especially disappointing is that I spoke to two different people during my stay about the food being served cold.  Both of them were apologetic and said they would fix it, yet I still continued to be served cold meals. \n\nI was told to be ready at 5am on my last day of quarantine for my PCR test.  Someone came to my room well after 6am to administer the PCR test.  I was told I would have results by 2pm, so I booked a 4pm flight that day to fly to Surabaya.  My results were not available until 3:30pm - so I missed my flight and had to rebook it.  The hotel knows how many guests they have - don't tell me to be up at 5am and then show up to test me well after 6am.  And I'm not sure what lab they are using - but again, don't tell me test results and check out will be at 2pm and then be 90+ minutes late.   \n\nWhether you are staying for a quarantine package or a regular hotel stay, I would proceed with caution if you are considering booking here.  The overflowing drain is a health hazard and I would have moved to a different hotel were it not for the fact that I was stuck there in quarantine.  \n\nBased on my two quarantine stay experiences here in Jakarta, I would strongly recommend the Shangri-La Jakarta over the Mayflower.",

I was staying alone and away from my family who I had left back in my home country.\n\nMEA staff and facilities continuously made me feel at home with their outstanding service quality, guest empathy, courtesy and friendliness. The property is marvelous and the maintenance + housekeeping gets a 10/10 from me.\n\nI fell in love with the Gym, Spa and Pool :)\n\nThank you everyone at MEA Jakarta... Terima kasih, Ibu Winda and her wonderful team. So many memories which I will treasure from my years spent in Jakarta and my stay at the Mayflower MEA.",

It also offered a great view if Jakarta business district. \nWe loved that it was within walking distance of lots of great sights, place to eat and also MRT Station. \nThe indoor swimming pool is amazing, also the jacuzzi and the fitness center. \nI would highly recommend this place! \n\n",

Indeed, their service is exceeding my expectations.\nThey help me from pre-stay, because I need to modify my bookings several times. During stay, from the security in B1 level, the one who help me during the check-in and arranged me taxi and takeaway breakfast because I need to left early. And post-stay, they reminded me that my driving license was left with them during check in. I'm giving them a perfect score here.\nThere was some issue with my dispenser in the room but after we called them, their engineering team was coming to check and replaced it with another one.\nI was worried when I need to stay during this Covid situation but I saw that all of them were implementing the health and safety protocols ensures me that I don't need to be worried.\nThe room was bit old, but all the equipments and facilities were working well.  We even cooked some dishes during our stay. Unfortunately, we didn't have much time to ejoys their indoor pool overlooking the Sudirman area and their whirlpools.\nBreakfast was served ala carte and you can ordered from the digitalized menu. We love their Marriott Breakfast -- the hashbrowns were really good!\nGreat job! Definitely will come back.",

The indoor swimming pool is the best part of this hotel where you can relax at the pool while staring at the Jakarta's main road scenery with it's skyscrapers. At night, the view got even better with city lights coming from the building. I would like to give an appreciation to Pricilla the one who was in charge at The Cafe and reception. Even though breakfast time was hectic and they seem to be short staffed, she still manage to be hospitable, friendly and attend to our need despite the pressure. Our check out was also assisted by her and we would glad to be back someday. All the best.",

And so many restaurants nearby.\n\nThe room is very comfortable. Everything is perfect. Although maybe don\u2019t expect too much on the breakfast. But there are so many places you can go for breakfast so no worries.\n\nWe surely want to come here again in the future. The pool was nice, it\u2019s big enough for the kids to play.",

The 28th-floor gym overlooking Sudirman does make exercising more fun as you are not facing a mirror or another building. I am happy you enjoyed the \u201cME Time\u201d in gym. \n\nWe take pride in delivering the signature intuitive service to our valued guests that have become synonymous with the Marriott brand across the globe. I am so proud of the team making that personal touch to a special occasion like your Birthday. I shall convey your kind words to our worthy staff especially to Vinda and June. \n\nI am glad to hear about the Chef Lukman took special care of your food and was very accommodating, I am sure he will be very delighted to see you recognizing his efforts in this forum.  \n\nThe team and I look forward to the pleasure of hosting you again.\n\nRegards,\nShashank Sinha\nGeneral Manager\n",

              "text": "Our visit was a blast! My cousin booked a two-bedroom Deluxe Apartment for us and turned out, he secretly told the staffs about my birthday so upon arrival, they came to sing me a Happy Birthday and bring a small chocolate cake, much to my delight. I really appreciate their kind gesture. \n\nTalking about the apartment, the unit had two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a kitchenette. All windows offered a breathtaking view of the city. Washing machine and ironing board were kept inside a cabinet in the hallway. The living area was spacious and able to accommodate 8 persons, including the four of us. At night, we welcomed our friends and had a small birthday party. The kitchenette allowed us to prepare some meal. With an amazing city view, the party was memorable and I was really happy. \n\nDesign-wise, the apartment looked chic in a contemporary style. The lighting in the living area was somewhat too dim for my liking. The master bedroom had a King-size bed and a spacious closet. The second bedroom had a Queen-size bedroom. Each bedroom had a TV. What I liked from the master bedroom is its master bath, equipped with a long bathtub and big windows overlooking Sudirman street, perfect for relaxing. The marble floor could be slippery so we really had to be careful when walking, especially after taking a shower. \n\nThe property's swimming pool is one of the biggest indoor hotel pools we've been I would say. There was also a kids pool. The pool area also had two whirlpools with a great city view. We also enjoyed their steam room and sauna, located inside the changing room. The gym was awesome, again with a breathtaking city view. \n\nSetiabudhi Astra MRT Station is right next to the premises, making commuting convenient. Overall, the staying experience was wonderful. We would like to thank the staffs, especially Ms. Pricilla, Mr. Daniel, Ms. Regina, Pa Supri, and Bu Vinda for the hospitality. We'd love to come back again.",

I am happy to hear that the indoor swimming pool and view did meet your expectations. \n\nPlease accept my sincere apologies for the lapse in service from our end with regards to kitchen equipment. We do provide knives and all different pots and pans for our guest enabling them to cook; in case of any additional requirement, we are more than happy to have it delivered in the room. \n\nI am sad to hear about the smell in the room and will further have this concerned investigated and addressed with House Keeping and Engineering Team. We are extremely focused on providing outstanding service to our discerning guests and it is rather unfortunate that we failed to meet your expectations this time around. I assure you of a superior experience upon your next visit and I do hope you give us the opportunity to serve you better. \n\nWarm Regards,\nShashank Sinha\nGeneral Manager\n",

Your insightful recount indeed helps us in our endeavor to provide best in class hospitality and service to our guests. I am glad that spacious units on the higher floor did meet your expectations. \n\nI understand that your less than satisfactory experience due to traffic, B1 access to the hotel, breakfast and spa experience failed to live up to your expectations of the MEA Brand. Please accept my sincere apologies for not being able to live up to your expectations. I can assure that we try our level best to personalize the guest experience by facilitating the access via Setiabudi side to avoid traffic; many of our guests love the easy and convenient access through B1. I will keep revisiting the breakfast experience as the culinary team does a fabulous job keeping in mind the space constraint that we have. We will work in each of our feedback and can assure you that corrective measures will be taken to address the issues faced by you.\n\nI do hope you give us the opportunity to serve you once again and I can assure you of a more satisfactory experience.\n\nBest Regards,\nShashank Sinha\nGeneral Manager\n",

On my first visit, operations manager Vinda Warganegara went out of her way to introduce herself, make me feel welcome, and provide high-level assistance when needed throughout my stay.\n\nIn fact, the management team as a whole is top notch.  The manager named Fundi, for example, gave much needed and high quality assistance for a minor emergency that came up, with speed and grace.\n\nThroughout my stay, whatever I needed was provided quickly, professionally and cheerfully.\n\nIt was also wonderful to have such a high quality breakfast service available in the hotel! The chef Rio offered special, delicious dishes for me, and Rama and the other staff there were friendly, skilled, and excellent in everything they did. I ordered dinner to be delivered from the kitchen several times during my stay, and loved it every time.\n\nI appreciate the quality of the room, furnishings, and accommodations; and the service provided by the staff at every level. Ari and Samsul made me feel welcome every time I crossed paths with them, as well as many other friendly staff whose names I don't recall.\n\nFor the work I needed to do, the location was outstanding and central. And the apartment itself was perfect for the work I needed to do each day in the hotel; the layout, cleanliness, and provided features and amenities amplified my productivity during my stay.\n\nAnd: I loved the views! Jakarta at night is such a beautiful city, and the view from my apartment was ideal for enjoying the sights, day and night.\n\nAs someone who is currently a business owner, but previously worked in private security, I must also commend the excellent security staff.  Part of living in modern Jakarta is that each time you enter a mall or large building, you go through a security screen. And the Mayflower's security staff is amazing at their job - both for the hotel proper, inside the building; and for Indofood Tower itself. They are professional and courteous, yet with the clear competence and strength to make one feel completely safe. I appreciate those who put themselves in harms' way to protect us all, and the security staff here is the best.\n\nIf you are reading this and looking for a premier-quality apartment to stay in central Jakarta - for short term, or long term - I completely and whole-heartedly recommend Marriott Executive Apartments.  And I do so without reservation. They can't be beat.\n\nI look forward to staying at this location again each time my business brings me to central Jakarta. Terima kasih.",

              "text": "The Mayflower was the first time i stayed in a service apartment, just remember if you are concerned about Marriott points and or room nights you will not get them in full here for room nights its 3 nights for 1 night and i believe 3 dollars spend gets one point. So basically your only getting 1/3 that of any Marriott hotel.\n\nThe rooms are very large, nice view of the city. I had a single bed room, and i believe it was close to 100sqm which was more than enough for a single person occupancy. I didn't opt for the breakfast as it seemed very small and limited in selection. \n\nThe staff greeted me at the entrance expecting my arrival which was nice and were very fast in checking me in and checking out as well as explaining the room and facilities. \n\nThe rooms are a bit old but considering the size to cost i think its a good value. \n\nThey provide a water dispenser which was constantly vibrating and making sounds but as the room was massive when i went to the bedroom it didn't bother me.\n\nMy only major issue which hit me a bit wrong but i accepted the payment. First i took silvercab, as i was told they take credit cards as i landed late at night and didn't have cash. My bill was 290,000 IDR a bit over US$20. The hotel told me they can pay for me, i was very happy as i didn't have to exchange my money at that point. So i accepted. When i checked out they charged me IDR460,000. This is their rate if they book the car for you and the car is waiting, I didn't have any of that service i waited in line at the airport to avoid such over price, so that did hit me negatively.\n\nMy second issue, they put a bottle of wine on the dinning table with a sign saying i qualify for 15% discount on wines and to call downstairs for the full list. I assumed this bottle was complimentary as i get it often in hotels. I was charge 950,000 IDR for a sub-par bottle of table wine in my opinion that is almost US$70! \n\nI paid both charges reluctantly but may this be a warning they rip you off on this so do not use these services. \n\nPut these issues aside and if you know how to avoid being ripped off the place is nice, the service was good. the location is ok, no real activities in walking distance so you will need to cab everywhere, and it is the worst traffic in all of Jakarta so be warned.",

It's kind of convenient for people working in one of the office buildings nearby.\nNo amenities in the building, the closest shopping mall is ~20min walking distance. So make sure you do not forget anything\n\nMy first stay:\n- Room not ready when I arrived in the afternoon\n- Room service took 50 minutes to deliver. I ordered at ~9pm and could only eat at ~9.50pm\n- Multiple issues in the room with noisy appliances (fridge, water dispenser)\n- Air con is also very noisy and makes loud bangs in the middle of the night\n- Phone: only 1 person at the reception answering, take your turn and be patient\n- Food is definitely very average whether this is dinner or breakfast\n- Pressing not delivered in the evening. Had to look for my clothes, check with reception in lobby (as I could not reach anyone by phone) and it only came the next morning at 6.30am\n- No assistance for luggage on arrival or departure\n\nIn summary, it is a Marriot. Not as bad as in the USA but not as good as what one can expect. from 5* hotels in Indonesia",

It certainly reinforces our commitment to providing our treasured guests with the highest standards of hospitality whenever they choose to stay at our hotel.\n\nIt feels great to know that our location in heart of the Sudirman district and indeed the walking over bridge does add lot of convenience for the guest to access other side of the road and is appreciated by all of our guests who often enjoy taking a stroll amidst its tranquil confines. \n\nI am particularly pleased that you found our units spacious and well equipped with all appliances which enables guest to have them more productive when they opt to stay with us whether for business or leisure.

They constantly asked if they could help out in any way. \n\nI have been to Jakarta many times, but I must say this is definitely up there especially if you're travelling in a big group. Its a reasonably priced hotel located near to all the major attractions and getting a taxi is very very easy. \n\nId definitely stay here again the next time im in Jakarta. \n\nThank you all for making our stay in Jakarta a memorable one!",

We checked in late due to electricity maintenance, but the staff already informed us by email few days before, and also granted us a late checkout in return. We booked the 3BR unit, 2 rooms with queen bed and 1 room with SuperKing bed and a big big big bathroom. We loved it. The place is clean, no complains. The breakfast is delish, with western and indonesian dish. We also use the indoor swimming pool, and also the gym. Everything is on point and love the clean locker room. The staffs are great, really helpful. Too bad I didn't booked the rice cooker earlier, this will be our reminder for next staycation.",

It included a kitchen and laundry. The bedrooms were large with comfortable beds. The whole apartment was nicely decorated and clean. We did not use the kitchen because the on-site restaurants provided all we needed, including a full breakfast buffet with both western and Indonesian choices. There were a few maintenance issues when we arrived, but they were immediately fixed, including changing out the entire washer/dryer so we could use it. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Traffic and construction in the area made access a little challenging during our stay, but that was true of the whole area. Definitely recommend and would stay again.",

              "text": "The Mayfair Marriott Executive Apartments is located in the business district of Jakarta. The apartments are spacious, tastefully decorated & well equipped for those wishing to be self sufficient on longer (or shorter) stays. The aircon keeps things comfortable with the option to self select temperatures, & rooms are equipped with wifi along with ample desk space - always welcome when working. A daily paper is delivered on request, & room service for meals et al available. Despite being on a very busy main road, the apartments are quite, with wonderful views.  \nThere is a pool & a gym for those who want them. While there is a menu for room delivery from the dining room in the evenings, the only thing that I would have appreciated was easier access to places to eat at night. There is a mini mart accessed via the ground floor for emergencies, & a few independent eating places ('italian', coffee) that close early - limited. As this is the business district, options that are easy to get to & offer the type of meals I would have appreciated as a busy working visitor (single) were very limited. I found out after I'd left that apparently there are ring & order/delivery type options - too late.  \nHowever, by far the best thing about the Marriott Mayflower apartments is the service. Everyone, from security at the door, front desk, the dining room, maintenance, staff at the door, those who keep the rooms spotless is simply amazing. The staff work extremely well as a team & as individuals -  always courteous & obliging, never pushy or obsequious. Always willing to go the extra mile without request. Smiling &  friendly but always professional - service that I could not fault. I was very happy there for almost a month. Thaks to all the wonderful staff!",

Breakfast is simple compared to most Asian hotels but very good.  The daily Indian special including Chicken curry is a delight - the recipe changes every day.  \n\nMoreover, it was located close to several excellent restaurants in and near City Walk mall.",

As an apartment-style hotel and serviced residence,  its important not to expect 5 star hotel luxury (nor do you pay for this!).\n\nThe one bedroom apartments are spacious although if you wish to cook the kitchen has limited cookware and accessories.  I would suggest any business travellers note the following:\n\n- there are no universal powerpoints but they can provide adapters (I had my own)\n- there are not many available powerpoints, so often you need to unplug something to charge a device (including the bed lamp if you want to charge your phone overnight). If you have many devices you may want to bring a powerboard.\n- the desk is a bit small and in the bedroom,  so I worked on the dining table but had to plug my laptop into the bedroom tv power outlet. \n- there is a minibar (at cost) which if needed is adequate\n- if you're a light sleeper request a room that doesnt face Jln Sudirman as its a very noisy road with a bit of siren activity at night.\n\nThere were a few problems with my stay early on, however to the extent possible these were resolved immediately (or at least acknowledged for future resolution).  What was particularly appreciated was that these issues were broadly communicated to staff and management, who were all at pains to ensure everything had been addressed to my satisfaction during the rest of my stay.  The manager and head chef both introduced themselves to me at breakfast one morning and were very apologetic - I was addressed by name by both and by most of the staff which is a sign of good service training. \n\nI would say this is an establishment that wants repeat custom, and is therefore very focused on guest satisfaction,  which is to be commended.  I will be back when convenient for business travel.",

The living room was very huge, my friends and I hanged out there and even put the extra bed outside near where the tv was. The kitchenette also was very helpful when we wanted to cook something. One thing the most i love about the room is the AC. They have the best temperature so far. Its very cold. Oh now i remember two things then, beside the AC, they also have this indoor pool with two jacuzzis! We could see city skyline while in the tub :) will be back soon.",

Of course it had some wear & tear like any structure that has been around a while but I was still very pleased! I would definitely stay here again. The location was good. I only say good because there was no food or grocery stores quickly available on the weekend. The hotel is attached to an office building & in the business district so when they closed Friday it was for the weekend. I got that shocking information when I went looking for something to eat Saturday.   Citywalk was a fifteen minute walk or so away. It wasn't an easy walk with construction & small roads. I was more concerned about becoming somebodies hood ornament more than someone bothering me.",

The staff is super trained and extremely well versed and courteous to help you out in any way. Rooms are located on higher floors and give you a perfect view of the skyline. Got a free upgrade to a better room and was extremely spacious Beds are big and comfortable and has just about anything one needs in an apartment. \n\nThe bathrooms are old fashioned marriott style which definitely needs upgrade when you compare to equivalent standard hotels. The bathtub is ok but the shower is too boring. The couch and dining area are perfect and have some good english channels on tv.\n\nSpa is just amazing with some good Indonesian massage options. Jacuzzi and swimming pool are also very nice. \n\nNot many dining options around the area. But many malls in 2 km - 3 km radius (15 min driving time). Plenty of cabs and uber available. One very nice Italian place in the building lobby and a nice coffee shop. \n\nThe breakfast room is small and has fewer limited options but very decent and tasty. For Indians traveling, they have few options in the 24 hour room service from Indian cuisine which were also quite tasty in case they decide to eat in sometime. \n\nOverall a great experience and would come back again for sure",

Nothing was too much trouble and there were times when I ordered meals that did not exist on the menu and the chef would not only create them but would bring them to my room to ensure that it was exactly what I had in mind. There were times when I arrived to the hotel in the early hours of the morning, and the front desk team would come to my room to authorize my credit card so that I could get settled in quicker, knowing that I would need to be in the office the next day. \n\nI would have absolutely no hesitations on recommending Marriott and am grateful to the team for making it a home away from home for me.",

              "text": "First off I feel somewhat bad giving the three star rating although I probably would have rated it with two stars if the staff had not been super friendly and the price not been quite affordable. That being said, unfortunately the best price and best service cannot make up for a sleepless night which is what I unfortunately ended up having. \n\nAlthough completely beyond the control of the hotel, there is loud construction going on throughout the night which my room was facing and I was not able to sleep at all, even when moving into the other bedroom which was only partially facing the construction site. Once construction nearby is complete I would recommend this place, especially at current prices. It is a good place for long stays as the rooms have washing machines and a full fridge. I stayed in a 2-bedroom unit which was huge and had two bathrooms. This would be an ideal unit for families and or groups of friends. The rooms do appear slightly dated and not at the same quality level as typical Marriott hotels in Asia. This is however to be expected given that you get 3x the floor space at the Mayflower compared with other Marriott properties in Jakarta at similar rates.\n\nPlease note that this is a serviced apartment so don't expect full hotel service, e.g. breakfast was much simpler than what you might expect at other Marriott properties.\n\nIn summary, very friendly staff, enormous rooms in ok maintenance condition but currently issues with construction noise nearby.",

              "text": "The Mayflower Marriott Executive Apartment is an apartment style accommodation suited more to those staying long term however it is also very much suitable for short stays. Location is perfect right in the middle of Jakarta CBD within walking distance to major office buildings, the only drawback is that the area is alive only during daytime on weekdays while weekends are mostly quiet as this is a business area. The hotel is in the same building as Indofood Tower occupying the top floors of the office tower, there are several restaurants and coffee place on the ground floor of the office tower. The 1 bedroom apartment is spacious and nicely maintained, cleaned and equipped with kitchen, washing machine, 2 TVs, DVD player, stove & all the necessary amenities for guests staying on longer period. There is an indoor swimming pool and gym on the 28th floor. They also have a small cafe that served breakfast and 24 hours room service. Ordered food from the room service and not too happy with the food unlike other Marriott property, taste is bland and presentation is so standard perhaps because this is an apartment not a hotel? Not too many electrical socket inside the apartment as well to charge your various devices as most of them are being used for the lamps or electronic devices. The only empty socket is located in not so convenient place i.e. Behind the TV or inside the bathroom. Water pressure especially hot water could also be improved as the water is only slightly warm, more cold than warm to be exact. Given its location and spaciousness, it is a good alternative to staying in hotels and rates are quite attractive as well.",

Opted for a 2 bedroom apartment with a living hall. Within the living hall there is a kitchenette, drinking water dispenser, fridge, toaster, microwave oven & etc... Including home entertainment for 3 rooms including the hall. \n\nOnly let down, is there are not even 1 electrical socket for me to charge my notebook or cellphone in the bedroom. I've to use the socke for the hairdryer in the bathroom. Nice view of the city skyline at night & nearby Kuningan area and still within the central business district area.\n\nIt has a massage spa & gym on the 28th floor & a coffee house on the ground floor. This hotel has dual access and is well manned by security guards before gaining access into the hotel lobby.\n\nThe staff are very polite & services are just like the usual Marriott group of hotels.",

              "text": "My husband had a business trip to Jakarta so it was the office that arranged for the hotel. The room was comfortable in the sense that there's a lot of space for just two people, but given a choice, I would book elsewhere. Here's why:\n\n1. Breakfast is very basic and not great. I've had much better meals at smaller hotels that are not even part of an international chain.\n\n2. We had dinner at the caf\u00e9 one night and when we needed our bill, no one was around. I tried calling out to the staff inside the kitchen three times, but they could not hear me. Good thing the front desk agent a few meters away saw me and gave our bill, otherwise we could have walked away without paying.\n\nThis also happened again when I returned the next day to place an order. The staff were nowhere to be found when I entered the caf\u00e9 and had to call out \"Hello, anybody home?\" a few times before someone attended to me.\n\n3. The soap dish had old soap leftover by previous guests and the toilet needed cleaning.\n\n4. One kitchen drawer needed repair and the gap cover below the oven fell off every time I opened the oven door.\n\n5. Thick dust that can easily be reached by a vacuum nozzle and a water dispenser with what I assumed were coffee stains. Take note the picture attached is after I wiped some off. It then makes you wonder how long the water has been sitting there.\n\n6. The refrigerator shelves needed a bit of wiping, but that was minor compared to the state of the oven.\n\n7. There were no mosquitoes, but something always seemed to be biting me whenever I'm in the room.\n\n8. I called Guest Services on two separate occasions to ask how much local phone charges cost and was told by two different people that it's less than IDR 5000 per minute to a landline. I made a seven (7) second phone call to my husband's office and was charged IDR 11,217. Take note that the phone just rang 5 times and I didn't even get to talk to anyone.\n\n9. There is not much nearby in terms of food or malls except for The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf outlet on the ground floor along with a Japanese restaurant, but both are closed at 8 PM and on weekends.\n\nIn addition, the traffic makes you not want to get out because even at 10:30 AM or 3 PM, you can easily rack up a rather huge cab bill. I think only on Sundays and public holidays can you get relief from the traffic jams.\n\nThere is a pharmacy (Guardian), but that too is closed during weekends. The only silver lining is the small convenience store that is open everyday until 9 PM.\n\nSo was there anything about the hotel that I did like? Yes. First is that they had more TV channel options than other hotels I've been to (which I believe is typical of serviced apartments). And second, the staff were friendly - when they're around.\n\nTips:\n\n- Grab one of the hotel's business cards at the lobby and keep it in your wallet. Some taxi drivers do not believe that there is a Marriott at the Indofood Tower and will refuse to leave until they've made sure you understand that.\n\n- If coming from Plaza Senayan or Pacific Place Mall, best to ask the taxi driver to drop you off at Wisma Nugra Santana which is the building across the street from the Indofood Tower and take the overhead foot bridge back to the hotel. Otherwise, you'll have to go all the way to the rotunda near Grand Indonesia to make a U-turn. The highway unfortunately does not have breaks in-between and the traffic is so terrible that what is supposed to be a 5 minute trip, ends up taking close to an hour.",

              "text": "This property is an apartment-style luxury accomodation catering for businessmen in an extended stay in Jakarta. Located in the main thoroughfare of Jalan Jenderal Sudirman, it is located on the high floors of the Indofood Tower at the Sudirman Plaza, an office building complex smack in the Jakarta's central business district. However, during weekdays one must be prepared to fight the notorious Jakarta traffic jam to get in and out of the property. Each apartment offers a fully equipped kitchen, private laundry room, a dining table, a living area consisting of a couch and LCD TV and a separate, hardwood-floor bedroom area. The bed and pillows are ultra comfortable, one of the best I have ever slept in! Couple that with the high floor location, then you are guaranteed an excellent sleep experience! Service is great too. Only drawbacks are the PAID internet and the somewhat limited dining options (both at the small on site restaurant and in-room). This could well be problematic during weekends where the other FnB outlets in the office complex shut down.",

              "text": "Much Less than expected\n\nFrom the start...the hotel had an agent/employee (?) meet me at the airport when I exited the baggage claim area right after customs. \u00a0I just happened to turn left and a man was there who greeted me by name, but no sign. \u00a0I had prebooked a taxi with the hotel at 360,000 for myself only; however, the agent showed me to a large van. \u00a0I kindly reminded him that I had a written confirmation for a Mercedes car, not a large van. \u00a0The Mercedes is comfortable, but nothing so special since there are many to choose from just waiting outside the airport, no need to book in advance. \u00a0In fact, the agent just 'flagged' down a Mercedes car that drove by; then, said a few words; and, off I was to the hotel.\n\nA fairly quick drive to the hotel was about 20 mins from the airport, but I arrived late Sunday night! \u00a0Otherwise, be prepared for heavy, heavy traffic during morning and evening rush hours, especially during the week!! \n\nOk, first...the breakfast was very poor. \u00a0I think my stomach got upset from the lesser quality of food. \u00a0Also the variety of food was...very poor. \u00a0It felt as if the breakfast was just laid out in the middle of a bar, the food easily became dry, and was just very plain. \u00a0No way was it close to 3-star quality! \u00a0(Seriously!) Not typical of the Mayflower Executive (?) Apartment brand whatsoever! \u00a0 If I were a long term guess, I would surely be tired of the breakfast within a few days!\u00a0\n\nSecond, the room was just OK, but mine suffered from the smell of smoke and the cooking from one of the other apartments. \u00a0Housekeeping sprayed the room and opened the window for a while, but it did not help matters. \u00a0And can hear the movement of chairs from the surrounding apartment.\n\nVery basic apartments with dated furniture. \u00a0My room had full tile floor in the living and kitchen areas, and wooden floor in the bedroom. \u00a0Kinda of a very cold and hollow feeling, not like a home. \u00a0Good storage area, and a nice-sized bathroom, but with only one sink. \u00a0Good sized frig, microwave oven, and a dishwasher. \u00a0Kitchen area seemed very adequate, and had toaster, rice cooker and coffee maker too. \u00a0There was a fairly new Samsung combo clothes washer/dryer which was nice to have, a full sized bottled water machine, as well as some basic cooking pans and utensils, drinking cups and plates. \u00a0 Bed was comfortable though.\n\nBut, nothing to write home about, and I don't think I will stay again for any length of time. Even the reservation desk is at the back of the large building.  Felt so strange....I moved to the JW Marriott after two nights.",

Kids love the big tub and the apartemen is very spacious. Need to remove the old furniture in the living room, the rug specially. Curtain need to be cleaned as well but that is just small minus from our stay which not bothered us so much. We booked the room excluding breakfast since i can make my own in the kitchen. The fry pan is pretty much scratched so i didn't want to use it. I even use the laundry machine during our stay too (impresive!). Carefull with the noisy sound from the machine, i was a bit surprise how loud it was. I ordered from room service as well. Food quality are good, the price is ofcourse based on Western which for me a too expensive and less variety on Indonesian food. We also enjoyed the swimming pool. It is clean huge, and in door pool is perfect for us due to weather (February weather). Too bad the water is cold. \n\nPeople are very professional, helpfull and friendly, we are satisfied with overall stay and will definitely come again!",

              "text": "Stayed here in November 2013 and chose the Two Bedroom Executive Apartment. The room was big and had enough space to accommodate our family of four. We requested one roll-away bed and still had plenty of room to move around. Room was very clean, bed was comfortable, shower pressure was perfect; and complimentary water from the water cooler made our stay very pleasant. Room comes with a kitchen (no microwave) and a standard size refrigerator. There's also a Washer / Dryer combo unit which works well with washing clothes but a terrible job with drying. Breakfast was complimentary and was standard buffet with a mixture of western and Asian food. Not the best but sufficient since traveling outside is nearly impossible with the traffic and questionable food stalls. Internet isn't free in the room but offers decent speed. The swimming pool was very clean and long. The water wasn't heated but in a tropical country; the dip is absolutely refreshing. The only problems my family had with the hotel lies with the staff. Although most of them spoke good English, there were two instances where they dropped the ball. On our two days, we requested a private car through Golden Bird. The driver of the vehicle was polite but could only speak broken English. When we returned that evening, we requested a driver who can speak better English. The result: we ended with a driver who spoke almost no English or about the same level with the previous one. The other issue was the front desk misquoting us the rate for using Golden Bird outside of Jakarta; to sight-see another attraction.  Aside from these two issues; the hotel did arrange our round-trip transportation from the airport properly; using Silver Bird. Early in the morning, you may hear the loudspeakers from some of the nearby mosques in the vicinity of the hotel; regardless of your room location.\n\nKeep in mind that this hotel is located right in the center of Jakarta, so expect heavy traffic regardless of the time of day. At one point, it took my family more than an hour to get from the expressway off ramp to the car garage of our hotel. Regardless of where you enter the hotel; you will be required to go through a security checkpoint. Since Jakarta has been hit by terrorist attacks in the past; security will be tight.\n\nDespite the issues my family had; this hotel felt like our home away from home. I would stay here again if I came back to Jakarta.",

Size is ok, but rooms are narrow and long. Space between bed and TV is hardly enough. \n\nBreakfast is poor and seem to be focusing on Asian clientele rather than international. In my view every 3 star Ibis has a better breakfast. The 'juice' is some unidentifiable sweet colourful liquid.\n\nAlso, internet is chargeable (+/- 15USD per day) and not very fast.",

So understand that you are getting an apartment first, and a hotel second.\n\nThere is only one restaurant and I think I got food poisoning there.  Only people who are stuck without food in their apartment kitchen will eat there and so you can usually count the customers on one hand.  They probably have to hold over a lot of food too way too long.  For this reason alone, I wouldn't come back here.\n\nThe second reason I wouldn't come back here is that the street traffic outside the hotel is god-awful.  Don't expect to be able to go anywhere during morning or evening rush hour.  We took a taxi and covered about 500' in ten minutes.  Gave up and got out and walked back to hotel. :-(",

              "text": "Stayed for a night and the experience was unsatisfactory. Booked an airport pick up via the apartment which was good as it allowed to board the Silver Bird taxi faster compared to others. However although the Silver Bird driver was repeatedly told by the Mayflower staff the location of the hotel, it still did not stop the driver from behaving in the typical Indon driver style-asking me the foreigner for directions plus stopping at least three times to ask for directions from random people on the road. After much ordeal I arrived safely and managed to check in without too much hassle only to find my key card not working. Thus I had to waste time after a very long journey to head downstairs to get another key card. I was fortunate to meet the manager on duty that night and told him he should accompany me to ensure the key card works. Lucky for me, the manager was with me as sure enough the second key card did not work and the manager had to let me into the room using his master keycard. He gave some excuse about the batteries not working. I had to spend another 15-20 minutes waiting for the technician to fix the problem on my door. All this time I could have enjoyed a nice warm bath - sigh. Apart from that room service food quality was yummy and breakfast although simple was also enjoyable. The key highlight was when I departed i asked the front counter lady to book me a Sliver bird taxi that has credit card facilities. She also helped me communicate to the driver to ensure the driver understood the different destinations I needed to go before sending me to the airport. That part went very well - thank you to the lady working on 4 July 2013 around 11am-12pm.",

Location in an office tower means in house food optios only availible weekdays - and poor quality (fastfood). Need a taxi to travel anywhere. Internet in house extremely expensive and free wifi in reception and restaurant was problematic - my BB wouldn't work. Would not meet expectations for the business or pleasure traveller.

Located in the central part of the city, Accessibility to a lot of offices and most of the good malls, is very good.\nMost things about the place are nice- being new, the furnishing is new; the layout could have been better according to me, with better space management between two rooms. The Master bedroom is big and spacious with an attached well sized bathroom. The second bedroom is comparatively smaller. The drawing area is good with a relaxed feel to it, and an open kitchen. \nThe kitchen, according to me, was ill-equipped if you intend to do serious cooking, especially Indian food, but the Manager of the place, Mr. Amit, was nice enough to provide us with a pressure cooker, an essential utensil for Indian food.\nStaying on the 33rd floor, I would say the view was the deal maker for my 2 months.",

Not hotel car available...must wait 10 min for a cab. Do not get a manicure or pedicure here.....total joke and very poorly done.  I ended up having her stop after 3 nails and removing the paint she put on.  \nThere is a cafe for dining in the hotel, but always looked vacant.  I ate there once and got 5-6 bug bites on my legs.  \n\nI won't stay here again.",

Jakarta isn't exactly a place to see anything from your hotel, so don't expect to find a hotel in a park.\nThe other top quality hotels mentioned had severe Internet problems, both in terms of connectivity and time. The Kemp disconnects you if you're idle for 10 min, and I was frequently unable to connect at the Hyatt for hours at at a time.\nThe Mayflower will radio a taxi, and like at the Kempinski help you tell the driver your destination..only the Kempinski requires you to use the more expensive Silverbird taxi. The staff is fabulous. Any repairs needed were done..immediately and well. The staff seems happier and less stiff than the other two. I've seen tons of serviced apts...and this was the only one of two that felt livable. The reviewer from London had some good tips, too.",

Washing machine doesn't work well, changed in a day; neighboring room too noisy, management decided to sound proof my room in two week; pants bought from shopping mall too long, front desk help me to get mended for USD3. The list goes on. I know most of the staff there after two week. Everyone friendly and inviting. The only annoying thing is the security check everytime I come back from outside. However this happen everywhere in Jakarta.\nFood in restaurant always the same but after a few tenant voice thier disgruntled they alternate the food variation.\nGym and swimming is a bug plus to this place, finally I found somewhere with practical indoor facilities and not just for photos. The pool always clean and good size and length for a few laps after8 hours of work.",

              "text": "Last summer, July 2011, I was in Jakarta visiting my dad who happens to be stationed there. My family and I stayed at the Marriott Executive Apartments for a week. I had an incredible experience there. The apartment I stayed in came with a living, kitchen and three rooms- two rooms with double beds and a spacious neat master room with an attached bathroom. As soon as I walked in on the first day, I was amazed at the immaculately clean rooms as well as the tastefully designed living and the compact kitchen. Each room came with a modern state-of-the-art flat screen TV, double beds \u2013 king sized bed in the master room and beautiful portraits hung appropriately on the white walls. \nAmongst the things that I liked most was the magnificent view we got overlooking the city and the infinitely long main street in Jakarta- Jendral Sudirman Street. Whenever I found myself in the lovely lounge, I would invariably end up standing by the huge-sized window overlooking the busy traffic and the incessant flow of cars on the busy road. It was a fascinating sight! One wonders where all these cars came from and where they were heading to! \nIn addition, like most women I love the shops when I travel and was I not glad when I heard that our hotel was right in the middle of a busy thriving shopping area! I was certainly in the right place. The shopping in Jakarta is simply heavenly. There is this place called The Plaza Indonesia Mall which sells all the branded items you can think of. We could beguile an entire day walking in this massive place and still not finish shopping. I highly recommend this shopping outlet for those who love to splurge. \nFinally, this review would not be complete if I do not mention the breakfast provided at the hotel. It is a buffet breakfast style. The thing that amazed me was that it served food from almost all parts of the world- Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Western and Singaporean amongst others. However, I always ended up gobbling up the local dishes as I really enjoy spicy yet rich flavour that these cuisines offer. All in all, I highly recommend tourists who would want both comfort and convenience when in Jakarta to stay at this astonishing place!",

I took the whole family from Australia, Singapore to Jakarta for a 4 day shopping and food fest. From the moment we arrived we were greeted by smiles and nothing was too much by the staff. Helpful and cheerful they gave that extra touch. The rooms was clean daily and it was comfortable. We requested Golden Bird Service and the cars always arrived on time even at the airport. They have a lovely small quaint resteraunt which we had breakfast, good delicious selection. It might not be big but how much can you eat seriously. Plus we are surrounded by shopping malls and resteraunt just have to know where to go. Room amenities was great the oven is also a microwave as well its good that my husband read on the manual on how to work everything. We will be back again at the end of the year!!! Recommend to all",

              "text": "stayed in a 1-bedroom apartment and it was a great experience, being very comfortable like living in a condo. there was a washer/dryer (although they do not provide soap), a kitchen with oven and stove top (induction) with full size refrigerator and even a dish washer. no microwave oven though. complete living room amenities (TV, sofa set, DVD-stereo player) and dining table. the room is spacious and comfortable with large desk to work on although not a lot of sockets nearby for plugging in. comfort room is nice also. breakfast was included on the ground floor caf\u00e9 that serve not a lot of choices but good enough to fill you in. restaurants available on the ground floor as it is in an office building and there are a few other selections nearby. taxi cabs and transportation is also not an issue. only problem I have was when checking out I have to show proof the internet is included in the rate (email) and when I prepaid for taxi cab going to airport, they weren't able to communicate and handover a paper or something to them that I have to call back the hotel as the taxi is unaware. other than that, it is value for money and would definitely be on my top list of where to stay when i'm in the area again, specially if I will be with family.",

If you book a car with them at the airport,make sure they arrive on time and bring a board with your name on it,I ended up with two different drivers from the Marriott after waiting for 3 long hours at the airport. The airport pickup is just a waste of money.\nAnd also the service of the hotel,they take forever to give you what you want if you want something...sometimes they forget and you have to call back to insist.\nAnd last but not least,the internet connection,the internet person on line isn't very helpful and friendly,the wifi connection is a bit tricky to activate on your device if you don't bring your laptop",

This will easily go into the top 5 in my list.\n\nSituated in the busy business distinct offers a lot. You are very close to the few high-end giant shopping malls in Jakarta e.g. Senayan City, Plaza Indonesia etc. There is a coffee bean downstairs and a few other restaurants\n\nThe one bedroom apartment comes with a very comfortable king size bed and the room is amazingly huge. Bathroom is nice and clean. Kitchen is fully equipped with dish washer, oven etc. I enjoyed cooking most of my weekends there!\n\nPool and gym are great as well. Swimming pool is like heaven! The place get very quiet at night and weekend. \n\nAs the rule of thumbs in Jakarta, never travel alone on the street at night and be sure to pick Blue Bird taxi ONLY.\n\nShort note - if you are planning for a trip to Indonesia, get 150k local currency prepared before you leave Indonesia. You have to pay airport tax when you get your ticket. No ATMs no change! You need 150k !!",

( Quite embarrassing and disappointing )\nI booked the Hotel apartment Mayflower Marriott Jakarta for 2 nights ( LUCKY us, we booked only 2 nights ,after the 3rd day we moved to Kempinski JAKARTA ), As We checked in , the front office clerks told us that the breakfast is only for ONE PERSONS ??????????\n\nHow come that you booked the apartment for 2 persons and you get only breakfast for ONE PERSONS...?? THATS WEIRD...\n\nat the END of the stay, they TOLD US that the agent gave a wrong information about the breakfast, which surely for 2 persons... LUCKY they did not charge us for the Breakfast... but in a 5 stars hotels and apartment like MARRIOTT, We deserved to get a compliment service ( what ever it is ) as they did mistakes and we ended up spending extra money for the service that we already paid for....!!!!!!!!!!!\nWe took breakfast outside with our own charge ( in another Fine restaurant in Jakarta )..\nwhat a shame ..!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1\nAs we checked in to our room, We found only ONE pair of Sandal, ONE pair of Bathrobe , but the room was clearly booked for 2 persons ....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and they served Instant COFFEE ( Nescafe ) in 5 stars MARRIOTT Mayflower JAKARTA accommodation ...\nThe shower was good but the shower handle was broken, so when we opened the shower the water goes all around the shower cabin..!!! the 2nd day its still the same... NOT REPAIRED..!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the staffs did not checked as they did their daily room cleaning...and not well maintained... \n\nbut anyway, We had some fun too in MAYFLOWER Marriott Executive Apartment  Jakarta.. the staff are very HELPFUL and Friendly... Specially MISS HAPPY.. SHE is the star..and the front desk staff as well as the restaurant staff.!!!\n\none more thing..!!! \nThe price we paid has included Internet WIFI... but Its tooooooooo Complicated to acces it.. It took about 5 Human resources include duty manager to help me to log in.. ( too Complicated rules and birocrazy ).\n\nThe BED is old mattress and not that comfortable ... but we slept anyway,,,,\n\nWarme regards\n\nCHANDRA",

All kitchen amenities were new and working in perfectly order (with all user guides available). Breakfast offered a lot of choices; gym was very well equipped and pool was good. The hotel is in a short walk from a residential area (Setiabudi) right behind the building where you can find some good local restaurants and business; also, it is near CitiWalk, a small mall, with a very good food court. Bluebird taxis waiting time was less than 5 minutes during the week and about 10 minutes on Sundays. You can also easily walk to Setiabudi bus stop for the Transjakarta bus, a very convenient way to avoid traffic jams. \nU-turns are not very popular in Jakarta, so I would prefer to cross the road in front of the hotel to get a taxi on the other side if I was going North of the city to save time/money. Big luxury malls, such as Sudirman Plaza, are less than 10 minutes by taxi/bus and there you can find a very well supplied supermarket. \n\nFinally, the service -- it was the one of the best we have ever received. The staff was simply amazing, very helpful, attentive, kind and always with a big smile. My overall experience was wonderful and I will definitely stay there again.",

              "text": "I made the mistake of booking here as it carried the Marriot name.  What we didn't like about the apartments - poorly furnished in the living/dining room, middle of nowhere, difficult to get a taxi from (min wait 45 minutes), if you arrive on weekend there is a minimart that takes min 15 minutes to get to by taxi for some essentials, apartment comes with almost nothing - we had to buy our own sponge for kitchen, salt and pepper, detergent, etc - many of these things i would have expected from an apartment that charges as much as they do.  TV sound was intermittent, took 25 minutes to connect laptop and ipad to wifi using phone support, electric stove couldn't be turned off and emitted much heat, took 35 minutes for waters to arrive using room service, air-con in bedroom is really, really loud - I could go on and on.  What was good - the rooms are spacious - we booked executive 2 bedroom apartment.  But poor furnishings leave apartment feeling cold and uncomfortable. Sofa is tiny and cannot seat 2 western adults comfortably.  Staff are friendly, security is very thorough, beds are really comfortable.  We have stayed in Jakarta many times and would recommend anywhere else before here - its really due to their price - you can't help but expect a great deal more.  There is nothing to do in the hotel - only 1 very small cafe, a very cold indoor pool, very little else!!",

It did not meet my standards.  The apartments have plenty of space and are equipped well enough, but the furnishings were tired and could use refurbishing.  The rooms were long, narrow and dark.  Not very inviting.  The worst part however is the total isolation you have by staying in this location.  Over the weekend the few fast food outlets in the lobby are closed.  There is literally nowhere to walk to.  A taxi ride in the evening to a nearby mall (3 KM) took one hour due to traffic, each way! \n\nTo their credit, the staff at the hotel is very nice and competent.  One warning for anyone interested in Marriott reward points, you only get one night's credit for every three night's stay at the executive apartments and if you have Gold or Platinum elite status, you do not get the amenities of free internet and free breakfasts.  Given the poor location, tired rooms and lack of expected elite status amenities, I will not be staying at this hotel again.",

The apartment is located in Indofood tower, i was confused to find out the entrance and the lobby so i had to ask the security. The security has to check everyone and every bag entering the premise which i can tolerate due to the bombing threat.\n\nThe receptionist was very helpful when doing check in and he even walked me to our room. When we entered our room, the room is spacious for 3 of us where it has kitchen, living room, and separate bedroom with bathroom. They provide all necessary utensils from spoon, fork, knives, plates, mug, glass, pans, water boiler, microwave, stove, washing machine etc. We found this very helpful since we have a baby so we could prepare fresh food for her. The room also has 2 air-con controller for living room and bedroom which are so handy, and there is also internet available both wired and wireless. The swimming pool is also great with two jacuzzi and gym equipments, it was like our private pool since no one uses them during office hours.\n\nWe upgraded our room into 2 bedroom apartment on our last night stay, we got a much bigger living room, 2 bathroom but smaller bedrooms. We did an early check out at about 4am to chase our flight and the hotel staffs were so helpful and quick to get concierge and trolley into our room.\n\nIn overall, we were delightful with the service and the room that we paid. I strongly recommend this apartment for family with children especially who needs a 2 bedroom apartment since i think it costs less than paying 2 rooms in a 5 star hotel",

              "text": "We stayed booked the apartment for more than 5 months and got quite disappointed with the service provided by the IT staff. First, the apartments are nice but lack kitchen utensils and you can hear the noise from a room to another. So nothing extraordinary with the accommodation. However, because we had a long stay, we had agreed on a free internet connexion for the apartment and its occupants. The internet connexion was, VERY, VERY bad (the wireless was NOT working if more than 3 were using internet) and we had to call the IT department many times. Also, when the bill came, we realized that 2 internet connexions were free but that the 3rd one and whenever we had guests, had to pay quite an indecent amount of money for a connexion. Even though we stayed more than 5 months, the staff didn't do any commercial gesture regarding that and we had to pay about 300 USD per months just for these extra connexions. Also, they had a problem with their land line system: they charged us for amounts of 400USD a month, despite the fact that we were just making some local phone calls. Noticing these problems the second month, we asked for the details. If they were always prompt in sending the invoices, they were very slow, even absent when it came to this situation. Once they admit that there was a problem: the land line bill showed a 57 seconds call for more than 40USD but to my knowing the communication problem has never been solved. They have just refund a very little amount of money: these particular 40USD as it was surreal but pretended not to understand that they surely had a problem with their system. My colleagues and I are used to this type of serviced apartments but we have to say that this one was particularly disappointing.\nGood note for the cleaning staff though: always smiling and available",

I am glad to hear about the units being comfortable and spacious for you during your stay. I will like to personally apologize for the inconveniences about the privacy in the units. I will further have this addressed by my House Keeping team to ensure that it was the case in isolation and can assure you that it is not our usual standards. At Marriott Executive Apartments, we strive to provide excellence in our product and service standards and it is unfortunate that we did not match your expectations. \n\nYour feedback is an integral part of our operations and we have made the note of your feedback on furnishing looks old, we are going to have our complete renovation of the units and will share your feedback with interior design team. \n\nI do hope that we get the opportunity in the future to host you again and showcase our signature Marriott hospitality.\n\nRegards,\n\nShashank Sinha\nGeneral Manager \n",

I was happy to hear that our standards of personalized services and cleaning did live up to your expectations. \n\nThe breakfast experience is most important element of our guest stay and we put all \nour emphasis on driving this experience I am thrilled to hear that team did deliver that promise to you. \n\nI was sad to hear that you could no use the pool which has been opened since last 3 months and was under renovation till March end only. I am sure that you will give us another opportunity to be able to serve and be able to extend you with another memorable experience with us.\n\nRegards,\nShashank Sinha\nGeneral Manager\n\n",

              "text": "Wij verbleven in een zeer ruim appartement op de 29e verdieping.. Wow! Wat een uitzicht! Kamer zag er keurig uit en alles perfect verzorgd. We kregen zelfs de New York Times smorgens in de kamer.\n\nHet enige minpunt is het ontbijt. Weinig variatie voor Europese gasten die liever geen warme maaltijd eten. Daarnaast was het bedienend personeel niet alert. Wij hebben ruim een half uur aan tafel gezeten en niemand vroeg of we een kopje koffie of thee wensten. Ze kwamen dan wel langs om de tafels af te ruimen. Dat dan wel. Erg jammer gezien de hoge prijs die je voor het ontbijt betaalt.\n\n",

We are certainly disappointed that your stay was not all that it could have been. \r\n\r\nWith regards to your feedback on the manicure, asking us to keep a wider range of nail paints, we have worked on the same and now offer a wide range of high end products. \r\n\r\nWe strive to give our guests the very best in our food offerings. As you may recall, the fruit you ate led to an upset stomach due to your medical condition at that time and a manager actually joint you to go see the doctor as well. \r\n\r\nOnce again, we apologize for any inconvenience caused and thank you for your review. We would be obliged if you give us an opportunity to serve you again and restore your confidence in The Mayflower, Jakarta - Marriott Executive Apartments. \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\n\r\nAmit Sakhrani",

On a eu droit a un appartement assez spacieux avec 2 chambres et SD s\u00e9pares avec dressing ds la chb de parents.\nLa cuisine am\u00e9ricaine ouverte sur le salon avec tout ce qu.il faut. Une buanderie avec machine a laver et s\u00e8che linge. On vs donne m\u00eame le liquide pr la machine. 1 \u00e9cran plasma ds chaque chb et ds le salon, sans oublier la salle a manger.\nLe pt d\u00e9jeuner \u00e9tait compris, c'\u00e9tait tr\u00e8s correct: buffet diversifi\u00e9, c\u00e9r\u00e9ales, yaourt, omelettes, noodles, pancakes, viennoiserie, gaufre et j'en passe. Ce pendant, la salle est petite, et des fois il y a une petite queue.\nLa piscine par contre est couverte, donc impossible de bronzer. Le massage n'est pas mal non plus.\nQuant a l'emplacement de l'h\u00f4tel, on ne peut rien faire a pied, il faut prendre des taxis mais on est a 10 mn du grand Mall.\nLe personnel est sympa et tr\u00e8s serviable.\nJe le conseille vivement si vs \u00eates de passage en famille a Jakarta.",
