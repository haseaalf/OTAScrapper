              "text": "DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND DO NOT BOOK HERE. There was NOTHING luxurious about this place. We got to our room and wanted to jump in the pool because it was so hot. The pool was filthy. Not only was it tiny, we couldnt even see the bottom and the water looked like pond water. We asked them to put the filter on and Brown water poured out from it, that smelt like sewerage. We asked them to clean the pool only to be told that the pool man comes every 5 DAYS!  \nThe rooms were dirty, rips in the sheets, mould on the walls, grime and dirt visible in every direction.  \nThe stench of moth balls stung our nostrils when we arrived. \nWe asked to be changed rooms but to see the room first, it was even worse than the one we were in. \nThe sheets on the bed had rips on each corner exposing the blankets. \nThe floors looked like they had never been cleaned and the construction site behind us looked directly into our bathroom-privacy lacked immensely. The construction noise started early morning and the sound of power tools were constant till the evening. \nThe shower head and taps sprayed water from every direction. The tv chanels didnt work and the tv clarity was non existent-the one chanel that worked you couldnt even watch. \nWe opened the fridge only to be mortified by the overwhelming stench of smelling like something had died in it a few days earlier.\nSince we booked on booking.com they refused us a refund. We told them we would stay the night and leave the following day only to be out of pocket for our last 3 nights in Bali-it was better than spending anymore time in this hell hole. \nThis place was over priced, poorly maintained and lacked cleanliness. \nWe will never stay here again! The photos and reviews did not live up to expectation, not even slightly. If we paid $20 dollars a night, this would still be questionable.  I hope this review helps other travellers get a real idea of what this \"luxury villa\" is really like.",

I can\u2019t fault the place whatsoever, the service was amazing and all staff were so polite, they can\u2019t do enough for you.  Breakfast was lovely and brought to the villa at whatever time you choose each day, which we thought was great. The villa was amazing and we can\u2019t wait to come back again in the future",

On arrival we were met by the ever so lovely Wisma whom we saw last time and she was just as welcoming this time as last.\n\nThe villas haven't changed and are still as neat and tidy as before.  The only complaint I have is that like most hotels overseas the bath towels are not as big as they could be and perhaps this needs to be addressed by all of those hotels and villas in Bali that cater for the Australian tourists.\n\nApart from this, I couldn't find fault with the service, quality of layout of the villa, they still do a great job and deserve to be applauded for their efforts.",

              "text": "One of the reason why I chose Taman Mesari over the other villa was merely because of the outdoor jacuzzi in the private pool. Little that I know, it was the best decision I ever made. The low density private villa ensures privacy and it was more like your own villa. It was like entering a different world once you are inside with their well manicured garden and fish pond alongside the lobby area. \n\nAll the staff was very accomodating, the hospitality was far beyond my expectation. They were very professional, love their jobs that they were able to go an extra mile to make your stay a memorable one. They know what they were doing and passionate about their job. I hope the management will continue to keep these precious talents that are very hard to get nowadays. Thank you a bunch to Ms. Wisma, Ms. Rima, Mr. Ichan, Mr. Heri and all the other staff that I didn't managed to get their names. \n\nIt was my mom's birthday surprise and the staff was so sporting in helping me to arrange it so well that I forgot that I only make the arrangements week before. I took the decoration package and private dinner at the villa and really satisfied and amazed with the arrangements. Food during the dinner was tasty and appetizing. They also helped me with receiving cakes and special bouquet I ordered to be delivered to the villa on the day I arrived. \n\nI also asked for their suggestion on photographers which they recommended a very good, young and talented group of photographers and videographer to shoot the moments. We love the photos taken and the video that we can't stop watching over and over again. \n\nIt was a very successful surprise,wonderful holiday and my mom was very happy, her reaction was priceless. All worth it.",

              "text": "I gave the facility 5 stars based on the quality of customer service alone. The staff went above and beyond to ensure I had a great holiday. I chose this property due to the amenities for an extended stay. I added the birthday package to my reservation, which was worth every penny. They even provided me with a bouquet of flowers. The check in process was very simple. They were even prepared for my early arrival. The quality of breakfast was great, and very filling. The in villa dinner went above my expectations. They offer a four course dinner. My stay included a free one hour massage, and I regret not setting time aside to schedule. They keep the grounds very clean. Be prepared to see a few small creatures, and be sure to pack mosquito repellent (mosquitos are everywhere in Bali). The pool is of a great size, and I ended it during my stay. The bathroom is massive, and I enjoyed the extra space. Take advantage of the floating breakfast, I felt it was a neat experience. The room looked exactly like the photos posted online. The location is perfect. I walked to the beach twice, 15 minutes to Double Six beach. There's plenty of shopping and restaurants nearby.\n\nAreas of improvement: There were stains on the kitchen floor, maintenance should provide attention here. It didn't bother me, but I would have preferred to not see any stains. The bath towels and hand towels should be replaced. They look very old. I would have like to have wash cloths in the room as well. It would be helpful to have a few more dishes in the room, along with paper towels. There were no paper towels to clean up a spill.\n\nTIP while in Bali: If possible, only use Blue Bird Taxi. They offer the best rates. I learned this quickly on my first night. Be sure to look for the name Blue Bird because there are several blue taxi's in the area.",

The staff are extremely friendly and attentive.\nThe villas are tucked away so you don't hear the hustle and bustle and can literally relax in your own haven.  An easy 15 minute casual walk to the beach.    Transport is easy if required.  Breakfast every morning was easy too.  Loved it here.\n\nThe villas don't have a babysitting service which was no issue as we used Bali's Best Babysitting Service and they were amazing too.",

Location is very central with a short walk to Main Street (Jalan Raya Seminyak). Very spacious and clean. The restaurant is very good with the food quality and presentation being the best by villa accommodation standards I have experienced. A few craft men ship issues in the villa finish but it doesn\u2019t detract too much to the stay. An excellent find online.",

I called the reception and they said the technician is already got home... \nThey checked the gas and they said there's no problem...\nBut then I waited but still no progress... I called again then they changed the gas finally, but it's already 12am... and they said to wait again until the water gets hot... which I did waiting for another 30mins, then I fall asleep without bathing............\n\nThe breakfast is on time.\nTHe pool is amazing\nThe ambience is nice\nOverall it's a nice stay except the hot water case......\nwhat you see in the pics is what you get",

              "text": "Villa 4A needs a bit of minor maintenance. i.e Shower head jets are not aligned and the floor gets a wash every time. Bathroom sink tap is loose. The decking and wood work is not stained which makes it look dated and unappealing, i bit of wood stain on all the woodwork would look magic. The vegetation (Vines and Birds of paradise) need triming. The vines make it look untidy and the birds of paradise are well overgrown.\n\nThe bed was really comfortable with a good air-conditioning system. The shower had great water pressure and was also a bath, 2 people to fit in there easily. The small kitchenette served its purpose with the fridge being ample to store some fruit and some beverages. There was a water filter there which kept water cold for drinking or boiling if you wanted a cuppa (No Bali Belly from this water - Thank you).\n\nA 5 minute walk had you on the street at Bintang Supermarket - We got most of our supplies from there. Money exchange was also within this area and it was safe and trustworthy (GMC or GBC I think it was called). Exchange rate for AUD averaged at 10500 IDr to $1 which compared to Melbourne Airport was excellent.\n\nOn the meter a taxi ride to Seminyak square was approx. 25,000IDR and 30,000 to Kuta.",

A pool and spa right at the door of your bedroom. Literally at the door of your bedroom. No steps, just straight from the bedroom door into the deep end. And a couple of strokes to the inbuilt spa. Absolutely wonderful. \n\nFresh drinking water supplied, gas cooktop in the open living dinning area. When I say open living. I don\u2019t mean no walls between rooms. I mean no walls at all, your sitting out on a covered garden area. Its just lovely. \n\nStaff are super friendly and tentative to your every need. Very close to shopping and markets. All in walking distance. Lost of restaurants right around the corner or you can just order in. \n\nWe would return to Taman Mesari without hesitation. ",

From the minute Ngurah picked us up from the airport to the minute we left Taman Mesari staff were friendly, helpful and couldn't do enough for you! On arrival there was no faffing around with check in he took us straight to our villa and gave us all the info we needed there!\n\nThe villa is stunning!!! Meticulously cleaned every day at a time of your choice and they are all very friendly and speak great English!\n\nWe had breakfast served for us every morning by Fery who was brilliant, you have a choice of American, continental, Indonesian, pancakes (you have to try these) and cereals all are served with juice tea fresh fruit and toast and cousiants those who thought there isn't enough choice are being unrealistic! \n\nWe had the BBQ on our first night I would recommend it the food was great and created a real feel of Bali!\n\nThe villa is nice and privet with high Walls but it's huge high roof creates the feeling of lots of space. The staff never enter uninvited and always seek your permition before entering! \n\nYou also have to have the in villa spa treatments all amazing and so relaxing!! \n\nAll in all taman mesari made our honeymoon the most amazing Balinese experience for us! We plan to return on our 30th wedding anniversary lol!!! \nThank you to absolutely every one at taman mesari especially Ngurah, Fery, Ichan, Arya!",

(And being very impressed)\nAirport transfer went smoothly.\nOn arrival we were told the room I had requested was undergoing maintenance so this was disappointing, after confirming this villa was available. An email to inform of this change would have been nice.\nThe living area in the villa is all open plan and was nice and roomy for the 4 of us.\nThe pool is lovely and clean but didn't get a lot of sun.\nThe rooms are clean but unfortunately this cannot be said for the sheets. They were 'clean' but stained. (Sadly something which is all too common in Bali) and was slightly off putting. As a result we requested the sheets be changed and then not re changed throughout our stay. So after this was done, no complaints with the rooms. (And the sheets they changed were pristine....) \nVillas all cleaned and made up daily with no issues. \nThe staff are all so very friendly and welcoming. English as a second language and quite broken so sometimes difficult to communicate but was not a problem for us. \nHad a lovely in villa BBQ cooked for us for something different. Heaps of meat! Probably not worth $35 each but a nice experience.\nThe villa itself is a short walk (probably 100m down a dark ally at night, but not once did we feel unsafe. \nShort walk to Bintang supermarket. Small scooter ride to seminyak \"eat street \" and Kuta. Nice walk to beach. \nOverall, despite not being as impressed the first time (however the villa was only 1 month old then!) This was another relaxing girls trip! \n\n",

They even provide mosquito repellents which you will definitely need. The villas are located in center of Seminyak with all the clubs and restaurants. It's crowded and loud but you can't hear any noice from the street in your villa.\nThe villa is beautiful and well designed but unfortunately a bit dirty and not very well maintained. The first day of our arrival we had dirty towels in our room. They've been replaced instantly after our complain yet in my opinion all the towels were a bit old and dirty. The breakfast list is wide and you have what to choose from but I would add more vegetables and a vegetarian option. ",

No compensation offered - simply a visit from manager who said their policy was to give receipts every time...we only received one on our final day when departing.  Just be mindful of this if staying. \n\n2: Used laundry service which was a joke ... washing got mixed with other guests so ended up having to sort through piles of clothes to find ours but ended up losing an item. \n\nOverall we really liked the villa and if we returned to Bali we may stay there again.

              "text": "This was the 3rd pool villa I've stayed at in the area in 2 years. Walked past during last visit and was impressed by friendly staff so decided to book. Found Taman Mesari to be excellent value for a pool villa. Was very impressed upon check in. Great pool with built in jacuzzi - bought my own blow up floating lounge but one was provided (not usual in villas) and bean bag sunlounge to follow the sun on the deck. Great kitchen facilities (full size fridge/freezer- also not standard) and the bonus of filtered hot/cold filtered water and coffee pod machine is excellent if that suits your needs. Huge bathroom/bath/robe area and great sized bedroom with glass doors opening onto pool and private seperate sitting area. Very well appointed with mosquito coils, spray etc. As to be expected in villas in Bali, the open nature leads to 'wildlife' to be present in open areas. This happens in all pool villas I have stayed in Bali (9 in total) and if this isn't desired - book a hotel/resort when you will not have the privacy open area offered by a pool villa. Was disappointed to also read the reviews of the breakfast. I wasn't concerned as I don't come to Bali to eat breakfast and also if I wanted the big commercial breakfast buffet, I would book into a resort in Nusa Dua. The breakfast served was highly adequate: choice of fresh fruits, cereals, 3 trays of hot foods, eggs cooked as requested and a selection of bakery products. Hot drinks also prepared as requested. The service and desire to impress was very good from the breakfast staff and anything requested was quickly sought. It is a villa complex consisting of only 10 villas so not a massive turnover of required foods in comparison to larger resorts.\nI did have to call reception once during my stay, the first night, when the pool waterfall was still working at 11pm and was a bit noisy!! Not really a big issue - but staff were at my door within 2 mins to check out problem. He went away and within 5 mins the waterfall was switched off and a follow up phone call was made to check the problem was fixed. Was happy with this service and assistance. Friendly front counter staff to greet and farewell each time you pass through.\nI do agree with other reviews regarding the road into villa. Possibly 25m of dark stretch in between main path (walking past large villa complex) and Taman Mesari. All other villa complexes down road past Taman Mesari face the same problem. A phone torch to light the path helped the situation. A small issue outweighed by the close proximity to Jl Legian and located in between Kuta and Seminyak near Double Six road. Check out prices of The Haven and Sun Island villas, The Kasih Villa (further walk up the dark road) to compare private pool villas that are all in close proximity. Well worth paying the bit more in comparison to Jas Boutique Villas (next door) and will definitely rebook for another stay in the future as I come to Bali 1/2 per year. Please remember Bali accommodation is not in comparison to Western facilities/building standards but they try very hard to please and display great design ideas. \nA phone in the sleeping pavilion would've been beneficial so as to avoid running out to make a phone call or if phone rings while inside. \nOverall, I highly recommend Taman Mesari as value, locale and facilities are highlights and will definitely be back.",

              "text": "I stayed at Taman Mesari for 7 nights in May.   My arrival at the hotel was disappointing as I arrived during a black out.   The hotel was in complete darkness.    I had to scrabble for money to pay the taxi driver in the headlights of the vehicle \u2013 I was surprised that the Staff didn\u2019t do much to assist with lamps or torches.  I was not made to feel that welcome \u2013 and was told that the black out was due to a fire nearby.   I was taken to my room by torchlight and decided to go out again as I couldn\u2019t see anything at all in the room.   \n\nWhen I returned later in the evening, the power was back on so I could actually see the Villa.   It certainly was a lovely Villa \u2013 very spacious \u2013 and I was able to start unpacking.   Unfortunately the power went off again for a while but eventually came on again.  Unfortunately, my first night was a sleepless night due to the \u2018banging\u2019 sound of the air conditioning unit in the bathroom.   \n\nThe bedroom was very comfortable and beautifully clean.   The bathroom area was massive and there was plenty of cupboard space.  The outdoor kitchen and dining area was nice and the pool and garden also lovely.   One addition to the lounge area that I would have really enjoyed would be sun loungers.   The chairs and sofa are fine for sitting, but not for \u2018lounging\u2019 after a swim.   I really loved having the filtered water (hot and cold) on tap \u2013 that is a real luxury!\n\nAs far as the villa itself went, I had quite a few issues during my stay \u2013 some were sorted out and some not.   My phone didn\u2019t work and had to be replaced, the safe broke and had to be replaced, both water spouts at the bathroom basins were loose and wobbled all over the place.  I asked if these could be cemented in and they were, however, were loose again the following day.   The kitchen sink had a bad smell and the water temperature at the kitchen sink was way too hot.  I couldn\u2019t work out how to cool the water.    \n\nMosquito coils were definitely needed both inside and outside the villa as the mosquitos were abundant. \n\nThe laneway walk from the main road is not pleasant and I feel that the hotel should really create a safer situation for guests by putting in some simple lighting along the way.    I was travelling alone and being female would have appreciated feeling safer by having adequate lighting.\n\nThe Manager was kind enough to meet with me as I wanted to bring to his attention some of the issues.   I was offered compensation such as a massage, breakfast or complimentary night\u2019s stay.   I declined these however on my last morning, asked about the possibility of a complimentary transfer to Ubud.   This was declined so I was very disappointed as this would have been something I would really have appreciated.   Needless to say, I probably wouldn\u2019t return to Taman Mesari.",

We admit in this situation we lost a couple of minutes control. \n\nAlso, I do apologize for any inconvenient matter happened during your stay with us. Our team will investigate the room that you stayed was and surely will take immediate action if the issue truly there. Since we have ensured all the rooms are in perfect standard. \n\nRegarding about the mosquito, they are growing faster here because the weather in Bali is very unpredictable nowadays. Rain and dry can happen at the same time. This forced us to do more and more action to minimize the growth since we know terminating them is impossible. \n\nHope in the future we can serve you again with better condition. Thank you.\n\nA Moment To Remember, \n\nPutu Sukadana\nputu@lokanantaspirit.com ",

The pool in my villa was amazing and caught the sun, that was the highlight for me.  The rooms are a little tired and in need of some repairs as you will see from my photos.   The most disappointing aspect was the allegedly free things.  Organising the free transfer was very difficult and involved, multiple unresponded to emails and eventually a phone call.  I did not receive any of the free massages purported included in the deal.  The breakfast was not particularly good.  No staff follow up about any of these items during my 4 day stay.",

The grounds are beautiful, the reception building looks like a giant bird cage and the villa itself was so gorgeous I was gobsmacked! This hotel is such great value for the amazing facilities and surroundings. The architecture is so well planned, each villa in its own escapsulating circular wall. Lovely private pool with bubble jets that wraps around the bedroom overlooking it, in a private garden with outdoor lounge and kitchen, even a second outdoor toilet. All to high standards. Then theres that bathroom! Breathtaking! circular stone wall wraps around with a double vanity, and a huge circular stone bath - looking out to a private glass encased garden!!! Seriously, could you ask for more? At this price, absolutely not. I research the pants off everything, and I looked, and I looked and I kept coming back to this place, thinking, surely not it cant be this good - theres nothing else out there like it. If you want total luxury, you will be paying a fortune, but even then, it wont look like this. The staff were just amazing too, really lovely. Most days I say the staff having a meeting with managers, for a catch up. Their level of care and attention was excellent. I could not have asked for more, and they well exceeded my expectations. Had one or two minor glitches with hot water and a power outage, but nothing concerning whatsoever. I highly recommend staying here, especially if you like a good bath!!!",

We had all the amenities needed and quite often had all the kids friends at our villa as there hotels didn't have seating for them to hang out in, or a kitchen for the basics.  Staff are really helpful and lovely.\nPlease don't expect the same building standards as Australia and you will then enjoy what you have. Take it for what it is and enjoy.  the locals are lovely, you have filtered water a fridge etc. Food service if you pre-order.  Our friends who stayed in other hotels would consider these Villas next time. So central to the shops, dinning and beaches.",

We just like to relax by the pool during the day and adventure out a night and the lovely curved infinity pool was perfect and the double Jacuzzis ideal for our purpose ! \nThe floating bean bags were great to sunbake on too followed by a relaxing read in the outdoor area.\n\nThe outdoor area boasts comfy furniture.. a music box for your iPhone etc which was great.. a 19 litre filtered hot and cold water machine... a blessing as opposed to carrying heavy bottles of water home from the shops !\n\nThe location is wonderful too.. off the main hub-bub road so a nice quiet area to relax but also in the heart of things for easy access to shopping and eating.\n\nOur only little tips would be.... please please install telephones inside the Villas too as it is very inconvenient to have to run outside to answer the phone and please please hire your new Chef asap as many holidaymakers do expect Room Service as a norm.\nAll in all we loved our stay there and hope to return again sometime in the future....\n\nWell done Taman Mesari !!",

The staff are attentive, friendly and a pleasure to deal with and our breakfast was delicious. Only thing I can think of about pre warning other travellers about this place is that it's located down a curved alleyway off one of the main roads. We decided to venture out on foot that night and let me tell you it is an intense walk in the dark back to the main road. However if you're not a scaredy cat like me this would be a perfect place to stay if you're looking for the bells and whistles. ",

So much cheaper than a lot and a lovely villa! It is very central to everything, staff so friendly and helpful. Had a wonderful massage in the room. We would very happily book this again. ",

Apparently it's was under new management.\n\nWe stayed in 3a and I was very underwhelmed it was quiet tired paint was coming of the walls and cracks in the bath I wouldn't say it was the cleanest either there was other people's hair on the floor. Some of the bedding was stained just not at all a 5 star standard. \nThe staff where great happy to help us get taxis and make dinner reservations.\nBreakfast wasn't great very basic we ended up getting the sandwich most days as it was really the best thing they offered or went out for breakfast. \nLocation was ok not far from the Main Street easy enough to get around.\n\nTo be honest I wouldn't stay again because I do like to stay in nicer accommodation if your looking for 5 star it's not.",

We slept well each night in the nice and comfortable beds. There are only 3 things that need to be improved to make it a 5 star villa. \n1) There were way too many creepy crawlies - lizards, frogs, baby spiders and millipedes making their way inside the villa. I recommend that all doors and cracks be sealed to stop them coming in!\n2) The pool was nice but night time swimming was a turn off because it was too dark. It would be great to have pool lights! ALSO there was no where to sun bake, so sun beds would be a great investment too. \n3) Finally, the breakfast is quite poor and expensive compared to what you can get 50 metres outside on the street. \n\nOverall, we honestly enjoyed our stay here. It was a nice home away from home, and it made Bali a pleasurable holiday for us. With the listed improvements we would definitely come again!",

A 2 minute stroll and you're on the main street, but not at all noisy in the Villa. After a busy day out, a dip in our private pool has been bliss! The design of the villa means you do get a few insects, but repellant and mozzie coils provided means that it's not an issue. The staff, especially Riska, Cindy and Fendi have all been wonderful and no request has been too much for them. We look forward to returning again one day.",

When I steped to the reception they serve us very well, welcome drink also wet fresh towel for us. All the staff was very kind and always smile :), and when we have breakfast we have 2 option : serve in villa's or come to restaurant, me and my wife choose to be serve in Villa's. My wife was pregnant almost 8 month, we have trouble in the airport before we go and we are really stress because our flight is 3hr delayed. Until we arrive in the villa's all the messed up all the stressed are vanished. The facility is really great, and we have a beautiful honeymoon setup for the bed, even we are not honeymoon couple, lets called it babymoon :) also we enjoyed the pool, jacuzi, and the rain shower. Overall this villa's is great from the service and the facility. I really want to go back someday and offcourse with my baby boy :). Thanks to Bli Putu for the opportunity and the sharing when we check out and Thanks to Taman Mesari for the beautiful moment for me and my wife. :)",

              "text": "We stayed at Taman Mesari Villas in June. This was a perfect holiday. The staff were great and the villa was clean and tidy everyday.  Bed was really comfortable and TV is big and new. So one can just stick a USB with your favorite shows or movies and watch it while lying on a bed. The Villa is good planed, with lovely bathroom and open kitchen in the garden. We didn't cook anything there though, but it still looks really cool. Pool has two whirlpool sitting armchair-like zones especially for couples who love to take a moment to relax and enjoy the closeness.\n \nWe didn't order breakfast, so I can't comment on how good or bad it was :) We like going out.  \n\nThe local facilities are great especially the local beaches, but I would recommend to hire a car, because it's a quite a distance to go anywhere by foot. As we came to Bali for surfing (no wonder) we spend all time on the beach exploring local surf spots in the area. But after salty days what a pleasure to relax in the pool and have a drink. Moreover they have a lamp-decorated  boombox in the closed garden so we enjoyed nice DJ mixes via my smartphone. \n\nVilla laundry service is ok, very cheap, but not fast. \n\nFood and nightlife are located mostly @Kuta, but the 66 Beach is also a choice for those who are looking for quite romantic sunset evening on the beach. \n\nBeware of ants :)These little monsters are all over the garden, they ate all our sugar, so put everything in the fridge. Especially sweets. \n\nHope U like my review! Have a nice and relaxing holidays!",

              "text": "The professional photos are basically what We've encounter when we enter the villa. It is that beautiful - especially the bedrooms and the bathroom of the master bedroom. Very clean, the utilities are complete, they even have dispenser, speaker ipod, hair dryer, everything. My only concern is when we arrived the master bedroom lock is not working so we cannot lock the door, thats why we need to move room thank God it's not fully booked that day - another concern would be sometimes the hot water is not working, the villa must improve this as well. My only suggestion is I think it would be nice to have the second room double bed as well - I was lucky enough to get the only 2 bedroom villa there that has both double beds. I think it would be great if you also put the double beds in other villas as opposed to single beds, just saying. So if couples are going both couples are happy. Also I think it would be better if you put a little more lights in the pool area. Other than that there is really nothing to worry about - the villas are clean, bed is clean and VERY very comfortable, air-con is cool, the room design is top notch, I really love it. The price is worth it. Would definitely be back here the next time I'm in Bali.",

They are very spacious, are well maintained, have a beautiful pool and have white unstained sheets and fluffy towels! They have a Bluetooth sound system which was awesome as I'm sure the neighbouring villas appreciated too \ud83d\ude4a. The staff were very welcoming and accommadating. The kitchen is small but not a problem! A big fridge and plenty of clean water is provided. See you in a year guys! ",

              "text": "My partner and I got to Bali on the 7th of June and stayed at another location in which was disgusting and putrid. We spent our first night looking at other locations to stay, we stumbled across Taman Mesari. The price was ideal in comparison to other villas and looked great online. On their website check in is at 2pm. But we ended up getting there at about 10 am in which we were welcomed with drinks and about 30 minutes later we were allowed into our private villa, in which they didn't have to do but they did. When my partner and I walked in our first thought was WOW. the place was amazing, so spacious outside.. And just the right size inside. - Bedroom was so beautiful, placed right in front of the pool alongside a separate patio area. Bed was big and super comfortable. - Great wardrobe space for all of our items. Safe is included. - Bathroom was gorgeous and very specious shower. Two basins (GREAT). The view in the bathroom was so amazing, it was all open glass with lots of greenery, which was relaxing. - Toilet was standard but spacious and clean. - Outdoor kitchen was great, had a big fridge, cooking appliances etc.. - Outdoor seating was massive and a great speaker system provided. - Towels changed everyday, bed made and place cleaned up. They would do this once you've left the villa which is very nice. They do not disturb you at all. - Breakfast is brought to you in your villa (if you specify). - Staff were amazing, they arranged our taxis at very cheap costs. And also airport transfer. - Two minute walk to the markets/AMAZING boutiques and restaurants, but still far away enough from noise and chaos.\n\nNothing Could've been better. I highly recommend Taman Mesari if you want to stay in luxury at an affordable price. Location is great, only a few minutes drive from Kuta, Legian and about 15-20 min (depending on traffic) from Nusa Dua. Staff were so sweet and professional. Highly recommend this place! Will definitely be back !",

Firstly the smell mothballs as soon as we entered stung our nostrils and dirt, grime and mold everywhere was partly to blame. The fridge smelt like dead rats or something decaying which made us all uncomfortable. The room itself looked like something you'd see if you hadn't cleaned for 10 years plus, cob webs, mold, dust and even blood stains on the curtains. The pool was a disaster also was green with mold and could not see the bottom from how dirty the pool was. Rips in the sheets and the beds were horrible. Honestly we would have a better time sleeping on the street. The price they charge per room is absurd, even half the price still not remotely worth it. There was a construction site joined to our room which look directly into our room and bathroom which meant ZERO PRIVACY and power tools were going from 7 till 7 everyday. WE HATE THIS PLACE IT SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN. THE GOOD REVIEWS ARE FAKE. DO NOT STAY HERE",

Breakfast daily was the best we have had in our many previous stays in Bali.  We had 3 romantic dinners and once again the food was stunning.\nLocation was great.  Just off the main Seminyak road.  The beach a 20 minute walk.  Wine shop 10 minutes away.\nSadly Bali is very quiet due to covid so sadly a lot of places closed.  \nAll staff at Taman Mesari were friendly, helpful and very professional.  We will be back",

The villa is super comfy and luxurious the bathroom was a dream\nAnd the outside area too. The own pool and kitchen outside bring so much privat sphere within:) you do not feel like you are in seminiak it feels super exclusive and junglelish I would definitely recommend :) very good internet and for me just the perfect mix of remote work space and amazing accommodation in Bali.",

Got us changed to a new villa but also same situation. The rooms were dirty, cob webs everywhere. Stains on the floor. Pool was extremely dirty. Toilet was not cleaned after few days. Complained Hair dryer was not working, nothing was done.  There was construction going on the roof, workers can clearly look into the villa. NOT private at all. There was a power failure on one night. Location of the villa is not on GPS. Grab and Gojek had problems finding the location. The pool was leaking. Please do not stay here as you can find better resorts at this price in that area.  Absolute rip off.",

Never coming back here ever. \n\nThe following happened:\n- Aircon in the rooms was really bad! i was perspiring. when we told the staff we got a comment like \"oh bali is like that. its hot\". that was unacceptable.\n- The villa was dirty and has cobwebs. Looks like no one cleaned the place for very long.\n- Pool was dirty with leaves and other stuff!\n- The service was one of the worst. Staff are not attentive and do not respond to your issues to queries fast enough. We had to make many calls before someone came.\n- We only found out on the last day that complimentary breakfast also included a bread and fruits basket. No one bothered to tell us or give us options.\n- No grab drivers can find this villa. everyone gets lost. \n- The pictures do not look anything like the reality. Old, taps leaking, everything is falling apart. \n- No privacy for the bathrooms. Very exposed. Very bad layout for the rooms and bathrooms.\n\nWe also could not get a refund and had to stay on because the other villas around were charging exorbitantly. so we just spent the day out and only came bk to sleep.\n\nBad bad experience!",

Once you actually look though, it\u2019s dated, has not been maintained, not cleaned properly and not worth the money we paid.\nThe floors in the main bedroom had liquid spills, both bathrooms weren\u2019t cleaned properly, the kitchen smelled so strongly of something (moth ball repellent??) it made you gag. The sliding doors in the bedrooms stuck. Easy things to fix for a \u2018luxury\u2019 villa.\nThere was no mini bar or in room / villa provisions (which I found unusual).\nYou have to order breakfast the night before which I didn\u2019t like. The servings were small and the food not great. \nThe staff are lovely but don\u2019t speak very good English, which I don\u2019t expect in an Indonesian country, but I do expect in a \u2018luxury villa\u2019.\nOverall, the stay was extremely underwhelming. Seminyak has some amazing villas on offer and I suggest you spend your hard earned money somewhere else.",

The breakfast is terrible, we found a hair in our pancakes.  The staff prepares the breakfast the day before.  The food is not fresh.  Before arriving at Taman Mesari we spent several days in Ubud and Kuta and had no problem, arriving here we got sick from eating awful breakfasts.  We have no hot water for four days we warned the staff of this inconvenience, but the necessary has not been done.  The staff is extremely rude and so is the manager.  I do not recommend this hotel which is supposed to be a \"luxury\" hotel\n Can not sleep at night because we hear roaring noise at the roof",

My biggest concern was THAT THEY DONT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH it was a struggle to communicate, so they always need to come to your room in order to explain better by using body language and pointing fingers! Plus they close the water from the villas at night to reduce expenses! Imagine! In a Vip villa!! Also they close the lights in the lobby at night for the same reason! So it gets scary if ur coming back to the villa after midnight. And every day I need to write down my breakfast list because they lose it everytime and ask me again to refill it! & even so every morning I miss something from my order and they dont get it right. This is only few problems I faced with this villa, there's more & more to mention but I delivered it to the manager face to face in order for them to develop their services because it was definitely not worth the money or the reputation.

I need 40mins just to fill this big one) I like how they made the bedroom with wood floor but black stone for the bathroom. Floating bfast or normal bfast is good. The pool is not so big but that's enough. Point plus they have jacuzzi in 1BR villa. But they don't have main pool outside unit.\nThe ambience was very nice. Quiet and peaceful. Even the location is not far from the Seminyak main road.\nBut, if it's rainy and windy season you need to prepare. Bcs they have kind of outdoor living room, so it will be wet everywhere if it's raining and windy. Maybe they can improve this one day.",

The villa itself was so nice, the beds were comfortable, and the shower head was so big and luxurious and then there was the pool and built in spa which we couldn't fault!\nThe only downside was the breakfast which we found bland and boring of course if the like the simples then you won't have any problems but when I ordered an omelette I expected the works i.e mushroom, cheese, etc not just egg and the toast was always under cooked but this wouldn't put me off staging again.\nThe location was perfect for us with everything within a 5-10min walking distance.\nThe staff were lovely and had a laugh with you most days which I found comforting. \nWould definitely recommend this villa to anyone looking to stay between legian and seminyak :)",

If you are very particular about clean and fresh, not the place for you. Kitchen is poorly equipped. If you planning to cook and dine it, not a good idea to book this place. Beds are decent. Location not the best. Walk about 5mins to the main road. Very packed area. Not ideal for family. More for party folks. Breakfast is barely edible. Uber or grab pickup is messy and hard, google maps lead them via a no through road. Requires more a lot of planning and coordination to get your Uber or grab. Not really worth the money in my opinion. Better deals out there. During our stay we encountered a fair amount of bugs too though some may say thats to be expected. If its about 20% cheaper i would say its reasonable. And the word luxury is a gimmick",

I was with my husband and 2 grown up children, therefore the layout suited us perfectly.  On either side of the open living area were 2 buildings. One was our double bedroom with a massive bath, bathroom area and outside shower, on the other side was a twin room, again with bathroom (with a bath) and outside shower.\n\nThe pool was delightful.  We absolutely loved our stay here, it is very private and you do not see the other guests.  Breakfast was brought to our room each morning and laid out on the table for us.  We felt very spoilt!  The grounds are small but beautiful.  It's surprisingly peaceful as Seminyak centre is just down a short lane.",

They even went out of their way to deliver breakfast to us early one morning when we had an early pickup. Their food was beautiful and they gave us some wonderful four-course dinners in our villa so we didn't even have to leave.\nWe ended up staying at a hotel near the airport when our flight home got delayed and the difference couldn't have been more noticeable! We'll definitely be coming back here next time we come to Bali.",

I understand that Indonesia isn\u2019t a developed country and the same levels of cleanliness is hard to achieve as western countries, however basic cleaning and maintenance would of kept the rooms in better condition. I have stayed in many villas in Bali which far exceed Taman mesari. \n\nSomethings include, Blood splatter on the the bed side table. Tiles with some unknown staining on them and a pool so green you wouldn\u2019t risk putting your head under. (See photos). No bottled water provided only a water cooler (which I suspect is filled up from a tap anyway). The shower had such poor pressure and went everywhere but straight down it was hard to get wet underneath the outlet.\n\n The location is good very close to Seminyak shopping and good central location. \n\nWould not return, there are better options out there.",

We provide A Water Dispenser with cold and hot running water in the kitchenette for free for every guest, and for the pool, I have checked that on the day that you were check-in, we cleaned up the pool, therefore, we asked you to wait probably 2 - 3 Hours until the colour of the water back to normal. We do believe if our staff already explain you for this issues. \n\nHowever, we apologize for any inconvenient matter happened during your stay with us. However, we are sure our housekeeping team has done their work as best as they can for the cleanliness. \n\nHope in the next stay you are not experiencing the same thing, and we are happy to invite you to come again to see our improvement. \n\nBest Regard, \n\nPutu Sukadana",

              "text": "A nights accommodation in Bali can range from A$7.00 for a Backpacker Bed to over A$2000.00 + for a top of the range hotel, it all depends on what you want and how much you are prepared to pay.\n\nAs we had never been to Bali (we are 68 and 64 years old) we had no idea on what to expect in the way of accommodation nor pricing so I did a bit of research to try and find something that would suit our lifestyle and finances.  In the end we decided that we would book a Villa with a pool in Seminyak and started looking for just the right place, luckily we found Taman Mesari Luxury Villas - Seminyak located on Jl. Raya Seminyak, Gang Taman Sari no. 8, Seminyak 80361, Indonesia.  We could have chosen a more expensive Villa but decided on this one because if we didn't like Bali or the Villa we could cut our losses and either move to another location or come home.\n\nWe booked for six nights which included daily breakfast's and airport transfers both ways.  On arriving at Bali there was a driver waiting for us who took care of us and drove us to the Villa complex. On arriving in Seminyak we were some what concerned when the driver turned down a miserable looking alley way which did nothing to foster a good feeling.\n\nArriving at the Villa complex we were glad to see that it at least looked nice from the outside.  We were met by a lovely young lady (Wisma) who knew our names and offered us a cold towel and cool drink (it was 1:00 pm after all).  After completing the necessary paperwork we were shown to our Villa (8A) and to say that we were impressed would have to be an understatement!\n\nThe Villa was huge!  It had an outdoor kitchen / lounge area, grassed area, jacuzzi and pool, all of this before you even opened the door to the actual Villa itself.  Once inside there was a huge bedroom with a king size bed and flat screen TV,  a massive bathroom with a rain shower and large circular bath tub, twin vanity sinks and plenty of storage.  All in all it was a very good choice, well at least for us anyway.\n\nDuring our stay we found the staff all to be very friendly and helpful, willing to go out of their way to make sure that we were looked after.  We even met the Managing Partner, Mr I Putu Sukadana who was also very friendly and wanted to know what we thought of the Villa's and how they could be improved.  I have even taken the liberty of writing to him privately to thank him for their hospitality and a few ideas on how to increase his client demographic (I have an MBA in Business Development and International Marketing).\n\nYes there are more expensive Villas in Bali that may have that little bit extra but if you are looking for a reasonably priced Villa, that has everything going for it then you cannot go past the Taman Mesari Luxury Villas in Seminyak.  Yes we will be going back to enjoy their hospitality again.",

We only stayed for 3 nights and had a good time in Bali. I need to say that the hotel is okay but maybe in need of some renovations and should be better cleaned since I found for example the fridge very dirty and not cleaned for some time. The pool was nice but not really cleaned and since they have lots of plants and trees in the area the leaves and stuff falls in the pool. The bedsheets looked maybe not so clean but smelled good so I think just old and maybe need to be changed. The villas ar big and you will have enough room for 2 people in the one bedroom villa. Outdoor kitchen is nothing we used in our 3 days since me  my gf like to eat out. Breakfast was nice considering it's included and you can also choose what time which is a +. The pictures are a little misleading since they probably are a few years old, it's more torn down then u the pictures. What I could say is that you get a lot for your money in a hideaway place but still close to much shopping, bars and restaurants! Don't know if I would stay again and that's more because i like to change it up when revisiting a destination until I find my favourite spot. They get a 4 for such amazing service and hospitality!! Thanks Taman mesari!! ",

It's a great place to relax with an outdoor table and seating area that's covered in case it rains + a small private pool. I recommend staying here if you're traveling with 3+ people as it's good value for the money (as opposed to having to get 2 hotel rooms elsewhere).\n\nThe breakfast was complimentary and pretty good. You have various options to choose from and the staff brings it to you in the AM. You just tell them the time and they ring the bell and set up the breakfast inside the villa.\n\nThe decor was nice. Very earthy with nice touches such as outdoor showers, little garden in the bathroom. The rooms are spacious. Each room had a bathroom w/ a shower, big tub & double sinks.\n\nThe staff were friendly and accommodating.",

From the moment we stepped foot in this place we were amazed at the attention to detail in regards to service that the Front office team provided. A massive thank you to Hery, Pipit, Wisma, Ichan, Komang and Riska for making our stay most comfortable and memorable. The excellent reception service we received was always consistent no matter which staff member was working at the time. Breakfast daily was always enjoyed and there is plenty of choices to choose from and served daily in your villa by talented cook oki and ferry and not forget to say thank you to our chef, ketut who arranged our BBQ on the last day. The villa was just what we were looking for during our lengthy stay as it provides peace and quiet and cleaned everyday by Arya, Made and the other housekeeping staff, just what you want after shopping in the main roads and listening to constant traffic and motors of scooters. We will definitely recommend this to our colleagues and it is on our list to return again.",

All villas have their own private pool and we can connect the villa and make it as three bedroom.\nWe found the staff to be very professional and friendly. Special mentions go to  Wisma in Reception and Kadek Kusuma in housekeeping who consistently went out of their way to help. Housekeeping do a very thorough job.\nThe Manager, Putu has done a great job of training the staff.\nThe villas themselves are very good and are quiet. You certainly have your privacy.\nThe pool was really good although they aren't the easiest to get into or out of.\nIt is only a 5 minute drive to the main restaurant and shopping areas of Seminyak \nIt is a 5 minute walk to Bintang Supermarket or to Grain restaurant.\nTaman Mesari Villas is conveniently located.\nWe had a Groupon and found it to be great value. The massages were great and the food was really good, especially the pasta dishes. \nWe loved our time at Mesari and we definitely back soon!!!",

I have been working in the travel industry for 20 years and taman mesari is up there with my top travel experiences. \nWe stayed in Villa 5B which is a 2 bedroom villa. It was unbelievable! Over 212m2 in size with 2 stunning rooms that are not joined to provide extra privacy. The bathrooms were amazing particularly the master. It was like a small apartment!\nI was a little nervous as you think that all the great reviews may be a little hyped up but rest assured folks this is the real deal and you wont be disappointed. \nBreakfast daily served for you and the food was so yummy! Easy to order from local restaurants like room service.and of course all the wonderful restaurants in Seminyak so close by. \nLastly the staff are all so very friendly and nothing was a problem for them. Thank you Mr Putu for all your assistance and you must be commended for leading such an amazing team. Everyone we encountered at Taman Mesari were amazing. Our 5 year old daughter was treated like a princess! Thanks to Mr Hery for all his help and assistance.Again all staff were amazing.\nThe best thing about Taman Mesari was you could spend the day enjoying your pool, relaxing and then go into town for a meal or just a wander around.We cant wait to come back with friends to enjoy this wonderful slice of heaven.We plan on doing that soon!\nDo yourself a favour and book Taman Mesari you wont regret it.",

              "text": "Where to start?! Everything about Taman Mesari was absolutely magical. We had the most incredible stay here. \n\nWhen we first arrived the charming security guard welcomed us and showed us in where we met by the wonderful lady behind reception who gave us a cold towel and delicious welcome drink. \n\nWe were driven about 1 hour from the airport. As soon as the entrance door was opened, our jaws dropped. We were blown away by the sheer size of our own private villa. We weren't expecting a villa so big, a pool so big, a garden so big! \n\nTaman Mesari is very modern and as a result everything is so clean. Everything was impeccable.\n\nThe bed was the most comfortable bed we've ever slept in. The bathroom was beautiful with fresh towels constantly. The complimentary toiletries that they give you are all lovely. \n\nThe service was outstanding. For breakfast, they will serve it in your own villa. You get a selection of fruits, bread, juice and tea anyway, but on top of that you can choose a dish from their daily menu. Between us we had eggs Benedict, French toast, an omelette and waffles. Everything was exceptional and such a treat to have it all made in front of you. \n\nWhat is nice about Taman Mesari is that their prices are really reasonable. Unlike other five star hotels who try to charge a fortune for food and spa treatments, everything at Taman Mesari, from massages to lunch, was better priced than a lot of places in town. Sadly we didn't get to try their  restaurant, but if it's anything like their breakfast and lunch, I'm sure it's sensational! \n\nThe service is second to none. Everyone is incredibly welcoming, kind and sincere. They go above and beyond to make sure everything is perfect. \n\nIt's a 5 minute walk from restaurants and shops, but it feels like you're completely secluded. We had the best time at Taman Mesari and we can't recommend it enough. Our stay was absolutely faultless and we can't thank the staff enough for everything they did for us. We will return one day for a much longer stay :)",

They picked us up from the airport at 01:45am when we arrived. The privacy is A1 as you get to choose what time they arrive for breakfast, the time they service your room and what time you'd like tea time in the afternoon. \n\nWe used the spa services for massages which were all amazing! We also needed to rent a car/driver to drive us to Ubud (1.5 hrs away) which they arranged. \n\nThe driver was very professional and helpful during the day and took excellent care of us. We also used room service to order food which they came in and set up for us once it arrived. Taman Mesari staff went above and beyond our needs and expectations and we can't thank them enough! \n\nThe experience was much better than staying at an overpriced and overcrowded brand resort. Taman Mesari gives you the privacy, attention and luxury you deserve while being close enough to visit the beach clubs and other fun places nearby. The villa itself is a short walk from Double Six Beach, Cocoon Bar, and restaurants and shopping which was pretty convenient.",

Day bed that they provide near the pool are comfortable and a nice way to spend a few hours unwinding after shopping/exploring the busy streets of Seminyak/Legian. \nIts only a 10 minute walk to the beach to watch the sunset and enjoy a meal. \nThe hotel staff are so friendly and helpful, always smiling and greeting you when you see them. We tried the breakfast in both the restaurant and at the villa and they both have a good variety of asian and western selections. \nThe waffle/pancake  was a hit with our son each morning and the pizzas you can order from room service where great too.\nWe would definitely recommend Taman Mesari and would stay again.",

It was our fourth wedding anniversary, it had to be Bali as wife had already booked the flyer tickets.\nWell, this place was just perfect-the villa's were spacious verging on huge, luxuriously appointed, everything was well and peaceful stay. Private poos was cherry on the top.\n\nThe staff always smiled and said yes to every request, so much co that I often did not know if the request was even understood, but sure enough, they came through with everything we requested-nothing was too much trouble for them,\n\nFree massage was included and wife thoroughly enjoyed all spa treatments she had. \nAs to my ratings:\nI gave it 5 for value, as we got great value as it hit all the spots, but it is not cheap.\nI give 4 for location as its not on the beach, but it is only a 10 minutes walk to the beach.\nThis was a real treat for the 2 of us and is highly recommended.",

From start to finish we could not have asked for anything more.. taman mesari team led by Mr Putu were at our beck and call 24-7 and they thought of every little detail to make our stay with no doubt the best holiday we have ever had. We stayed in Villa 4B which was in a lovely quiet spot on the complex, we had complete privacy and the villa has everything you need and more to make for an unbelievable stay. We had our lovely breakfast served in the villa every morning and one night i arranged for a romantic dinner to be prepared in our villa, which was amazing! the team came in and transformed our villa into a romantic paradise, candles and flower arrangements floating on our pool and much more! These are effectively serviced villa's i.e its not a resort as you would imagine..but its better as you literally have 24 hour service and whatever you need, they will get for you... including a wide range of take away foods from local restaurants (i.e proper restaurants not McD's or BK!). The team at taman mesari find just the right balance to service your every need whilst giving you that privacy that you ultimately are paying for. We even got invited to the 1th birthday party of taman mesari whilst we were there where you could see how great a family atmosphere the staff have created. If we ever go back to Bali there is only 1 place we will stay and i would recommend Taman Mesari to anyone considering a private villa booking in Bali. It is in the up market area of Seminyak that is undergoing some major development, but not anything that impacts your stay. Book now and dont be disappointed!  Mr Putu is a legend! :-)",

We wanted to stay somewhere exclusive, private and very luxurious.\nWell, this villa  was a stand out! The villas are gorgeous! Massive open air living areas, gorgeous bedroom, bathroom and the pool and grounds are fabulous.\nSome people may not like that the living areas and bathroom are \"open air\" and so are whatever the temperature is outside but personally I liked it. It made me remember that I was on a tropical island and also appreciate just how good the air conditioning in the Bedroom was. The large open living area does have two ceiling fans made though which made the living area very comfortable. And if you do get hot, go for a swim in your private pool, completely nude, no one can see you over the 3m+ high rendered walls!\nEvery morning someone would come and serve us breakfast in our own villa at a time we requested and we also arranged for two masseurs to give us private massages in the grounds of our private villa.",

              "text": "I loved this place - it's set back from the main road so it's perfectly tranquil, away from the bustle of Seminyak. The only sound comes from the waterfall into the private pool. The layout of the villa enhances the outdoors and is surrounded by lush greenery. It's a small, boutique establishment so you rarely see or hear other guests. Staff were very friendly and attended to our needs quickly. It's very handy having breakfast delivered to your villa, but order for 15 min before you want it because it will be late! We got a couples massage and a 4 course private dinner included in our room and both were fantastic. Awesome having 15L water coolers provided too, so we could cut down on plastic waste. The faults pointed out in previous reviews are fair, but overall our stay was very positive. ",

Most probably due to rain,but due to the open concept,these frogs will just jump all over.Scary! So u can just call the reception and they will send people immediately.\nDo not go bali in september,the rain just spoil everything!\nI love the villa and all,theres a speaker so u can just plug your phone and pump some music!

Personnel tr\u00e8s bien. Piscine sympa (pas avec des enfants )mais pas de transats et peu de jardin permettant de s exposer au soleil. Aux 2 commentaires r\u00e9cents qui sont catastrophiques je pense qu ils sont tomb\u00e9s sur une mauvaise p\u00e9riode. A tous les voyageurs ne pas oublier que vous \u00eates en Asie \u00e0 40\u20ac la nuit par personne. Somme ridicule vs la prestation offerte. Il y a mieux encore mais c est plus cher",

Tous cela n\u2019emp\u00eache pas que l\u2019endroit reste tr\u00e8s beau mais un s\u00e9rieux coup de rafra\u00eechissement serait le bienvenue. \nPour le prix il y a bien mieux \u00e0 Seminyak et bien plus propre ( certe le prix n\u2019est pas excessif mais la propret\u00e9 dans tout type d\u2019herbgement touristique reste primordial)\nLe staff reste tout de m\u00eame tr\u00e8s sympathique et tr\u00e8s profesionnel! J\u2019esp\u00e8re pour cet h\u00f4tel qu\u2019il feront le n\u00e9cessaire pour satisfaire leur client\u00e8le. Je leur souhaite...\n",

My team and I was doing some preventive action to minimize this kind of issue. \nRegarding about the honeymoon set up that you requested for free of charged to our reservation that is all that we can do for you. I do believe our reservation team already explained to you if you wish an awesome honeymoon set up with additional campaign, chocolate box, balloon and hand bouquet flower, there will be extra charge for it. \nI am requesting your kind understanding that something might be happened outside of our control, However, we really appreciate your decision to choose to not stay with us, therefore we refund your money 100% even your booking is a non-refundable booking. \nThank you for your reminder to be better and better. \nOnce again we regret for not being able to deliver our best service and hope we can still serve you in the future. \n\nA Moment To Remember, \nPutu Sukadana \nputu@lokanantaspirit.com\n",

Que ce soit l'\u00e9tat de v\u00e9tust\u00e9 du mobilier, la qualit\u00e9 incommensurablement m\u00e9diocre de la nourriture. Ou le manque d'initiative, de r\u00e9action, de connaissance des codes du Luxe de l'ensemble du staff (direction comprise), la salet\u00e9 de l'ensemble des installations et du linge mise \u00e0 disposition dans la Villas ou encore la configuration des lieux rendant la piscine inutilisable du fait d'un manque d'exposition au soleil. Sans oublier le prix honteusement \u00e9lev\u00e9 d'une si pitoyable prestation. \n\nIl est donc certain que cet h\u00f4tel ne m\u00e9rite aucunement ses 5 \u00e9toiles. La r\u00e9alit\u00e9 des choses menant plut\u00f4t cet h\u00f4tel aux alentours du deux \u00e9toiles. Sans plaisanter, malheureusement! \n\nNous avions donc r\u00e9server pour 7 jours et sommes parties au bout de 3,  apr\u00e8s une \u00e2pre n\u00e9gociation avec un staff aucunement qualifi\u00e9, d\u00e9pass\u00e9 et livr\u00e9 \u00e0 lui m\u00eame. \n\nLa note de cette h\u00f4tel s'approchant des 8 sur booking rel\u00e8ve tout simplement du miracle ou de l'escroquerie digitale. \n\nLe seul point positif de cet \u00e9tablissement \u00e9tant effectivement sont emplacement. Cependant celui ci ne suffira certainement pas \u00e0 vous faire oublier le marasme r\u00e9gnant dans la villa. \n\nBooking devrait peut \u00eatre penser \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier la qualit\u00e9 et la pertinence de la notation de ces partenaires commerciaux. \n\nCar il s'agit belle bien d'une minable escroquerie en bande organis\u00e9 . \n\nCette h\u00f4tel est donc \u00e0 bannir de votre recherche de bien \u00eatre \u00e0 Bali. \n\n#tristesse #escroc #pitoyable #cethotelvafermer #passetonchemin",

Und es war super, h\u00e4tten es uns nicht besser vorstellen k\u00f6nnen. Die Villen sind einfach traumhaft und sehr gro\u00df, jeden Tag bekamen wir frische Hand und Badet\u00fccher die sehr angenehm nach Seife rochen. Das Personal war sehr nett und immer sehr hilfsbereit und zuvorkommend. Man kann sie auch immer nach Tipps fragen. Das Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck wurde t\u00e4glich zur gew\u00fcnschten Zeit  in die Villa serviert. Es war ein sehr angenehmer und sch\u00f6ner Aufenthalt. K\u00f6nnen es nur jedem weiterempfehlen. ",
