Once again the staff were fantastic, and we enjoyed the same beautiful outlook as the other villas.  Our neighbours were a farmer planting his rice paddies and a cute nursery of ducklings.  There are so many local spots to be enjoyed, and many great restaurants nearby,  There are few places in Ubud that are so close to town but feel so far away.  Absolutely the best location and villa experience you will get in Ubud.  Loved it.",

We appreciated the modern touches, while staying true to the Balinese architecture.\n\nWe had a lovely view from our pool area, and enjoyed the serenity and tranquility. \n\nSpecial thank you to our butler Wayan who was lovely from the first second we met her, and helped make our stay truly special. The amazing breakfast served in the garden patio, as well as discretion and cleanliness of the house, and her constant smile made us want to stay at Satori Villas forever! \n\nI'd highly recommend this place to anyone who visits the wonderful area of Ubud.\n\nThank you for everything Wayan and Ketut !",

This changed as soon as we jumped on the back of a couple of mopeds and were whisked skillfully through the streets and paddy fields to Satori Villas. We actually stayed in the villa named Satori. A 3 bed private pool villa. We were given a phone that we could contact the staff at anytime. \nBreakfast was ordered and arranged the day before and each morning we came downstairs to a glorious breakfast spread set up on the terrace overlooking the pool and paddy fields.\nThis setting of this place is truly breath taking. just a few minutes away from the bustle of Ubud yet it felt so tranquil.\nCan't recommend this place highly enough.

We live in a luxury house, very simsimilar to this, making it even more comfortable. It's ambient art works and quality furniture are both impressive and comfortable. Being a good cook that enjoys cooking, the kitchen has everything you could need. The aesthetically placed tropical plants, are almost framed from inside. The outdoor area is exceptional. Cleanest, best maintained pool along with nurtured plants highlighted by arty stones and paths.\nThe staff are wonderful. They action any request. Having a butler come into the kitchen to make your breakfast is a great addition and delicious. \nSet amidst serene rice fields, where you are mesmerized by their beauty from the comfy balcony furniture.\nThis is a dream come true.\nI do not review lightly. Only ever if I'm impressed. This has surpassed all expectations indeed.",

We loved being away from the hustle and bustle of Main Ubud but close enough to easily get down there on the staff driven scooters. The staff were the best thing about this place - they were all so lovely and helpful. My niece had broken her toe and was on crutches and they were great in making her stay as comfortable as possible. \n\nThe breakfasts were delicious, the pool was great and there are plenty of local restaurants within walking distance or available for delivery. We wish we could have stayed longer.",

Wayan for her excellent breakfasts and discreet housekeeping . The team of drivers. Always available to advise and totally on call fir any issues . All requests , even the pre arrival ones were fully catered for . The only very slight negative is that , unless you are happy to walk 10-15 minutes, then the main areas can only be reached by scooter and sometimes this felt like we were imposing on the staff . That is probably more us than them . Would definitely recommend and return at some point .",

It is a nice walk to town, but located in the Rice fields that provide a feeling of open space and serene nature. My favorite thing is to be lulled to sleep by the beautiful nature sounds and to stargaze in the evenings. A bonus are the lovely staff that keep things in perfect order, help out with questions of all kinds, and prepare a beautiful breakfast each day. It is a beautiful experience to stay at the Satori Villas.",

Refresh, rejuvenate, sip a cool drink overlooking the green rice fields, or walk into vibrant Ubud center and enjoy dinner and a Balinese cultural show.  The best of both worlds, with a perfect location and dedicated staff to help in any way!  All the best from all of us at your Satori home",

              "text": "We - three couples - spent 4 days at this perfectly placed and thoughtfully fit out villa, including the annual Nyepi celebration of 24 hours of silence when the island of Bali shuts down - I wanted more! The villa is serenely set high among the scenic rice paddies just a 10 min walk to the heart of bustling Ubud. It is spacious and well appointed with nothing left not thought through from comfortable bedding, yoga mats, pool towels, a full kitchen, pool and pool guest house, the ability to open up the house to the breeze or if needed because lets face it, it is on the equator and it does get hot - air conditioning in every room (including the living area if you need).  The wifi is fast for those that need to stay connected. While it is set among the rice paddies, there is a community here with artists and restaurants (Sweet Orange!) for the finding. The walk down to the main road takes you through a local neighborhood with plenty of shops and restaurants that are a quiet break from what is going just 50m away. For anyone with walking issue, the villa staff will provide transport down and back up. The villa staff - Wayan and Ketut especially who have been there for a decade are quick to see to every comfort and much is anticipated - there are umbrellas and flash lights and yes, bug spray as well as a local cell with everyone's numbers including Gede, the driver - so you are always connected if you need.  Really, we cannot say enough about the location, the villa and the hospitality of Kasey and her team. If you like the photos on the website, you will fall in love with it in person. We very much plan on being repeaters.",

Having traveled  for many years we have never experienced such a wonderful staff. At the end of our stay we felt we were abandoning family and promised we would return.

The house is amazing, such a great place to stay after a 25 hour flight from the states.  \n \nMy husband and I spent 5 days at Satori and really hated to leave.  It is so relaxing and the staff goes above and beyond catering to your every need,  The breakfast is excellent and made fresh every day.\n\nWe walked everywhere.  Ubud is so close and such a fun town to walk to for dinner, shopping and nightly entertainment.\n\nYou will not go wrong staying at  Satori Villas!",

Satori was a welcoming, comfortable and tranquil place serving all \nour needs.  The surrounding is magical amongst rice fields. \n\nI am particularly GRATEFUL form the help of Kasey Peterson, owner of Satori.  A gift was purchased at the silver workshop for my daughter\u2019s birthday.  In my relaxed state, left the present in the safety box.  Only panic when I arrived home and can\u2019t the gift.\nI contacted Kasey who replied that Wayan, found it the day we left. Her honesty and diligence touch me deeply.  In short, my daughter received the gifts.  THANK YOU SO MUCH , Wayan and Kasey.",

On our most recent visit Villa Serena was booked but the owner Kasey was happy to accomodate us at Villa Satori. This villa just has a beautiful feel to it - from the upstairs verandah overlooking the rice paddies, to the downstairs dining area and huge pool surrounded by tropical plants. And of course there is Wayan, who looks after the villa and makes breakfast every morning. She is an absolute gem and nothing is too much trouble.This time we had friends stay with us in the villa guest house, a separate self-contained unit facing the pool. There is just something magical about waking up at the villa and hearing the sounds of the ducks and looking out over the rice fields to the palm trees in the distance. For total relaxation, book a massage with Wayan Shanty, it will be the best massage you will have in Bali.\nSatori is special villa in a special location. It is what staying in Ubud is about.",

Wayan kept the villa spotless (with 4 children under 7 staying, that is saying something). She cooked us an amazing breakfast each morning, organised in villa massages and even babysat our kids so we could go out to dinner alone. We accidentally left a charger at the villa at check out, I sent an email to Satori Villas and the next day it was delivered to our new hotel in Jimbaran Bay. Thank you for such a wonderful time!!",

When we arrived at Satori Villas we were stunned by the amazing views over a large expanse of rice fields. Never before had we had such a wonderful outlook and it continued to delight us for the duration of our two week stay. What we loved about Satori Villas is that we felt in touch with the authentic Bali and it's beautiful people. \n\nThe staff were superb and at the end of our stay we felt sad to say goodbye. They greeted us with big smiles each morning, happily made us delicious breakfasts and were readily available if we had any needs or requests during the day. They took us to and from the centre of Ubud on motorcycles whenever we asked but mostly we liked to walk the short and fascinating small road ourselves. By the end of the two weeks we got to know several of the locals and it was great to stop and have a chat (despite our limited Indonesian vocabulary).\n\nThe Villa was expansive, extremely comfortable and with many areas to relax - both inside and out. It was filled with Balinese art and furnishings and surrounded by a fabulous tropical garden. \n\nFor us our stay at Satori Villas was a perfect combination of luxury and an authentic Balinese experience - we can highly recommend it if you are planning to visit Ubud.",

              "text": "Our home-away-from-home. For about the last year and a half, we have been living part-time in Bali and Satori Villas has been our home-away-from-home. We have stayed in 2 BR Serena, 3BR Solera and 3BR Santana each for a several months at a time. We stayed in 1BR Siri for a few days.\n\nThey are all great, beautifully located in the rice fields with great views, good breezes, nice pools, and an attentive and lovely staff. Maybe the best thing is that Satori Villas are located right on a lovely rice field walk, and only a 10 min walk (or 3 min scooter ride) to town. They are a bit elevated from town, so it is noticeably cooler and breezier. And quieter \u2013 serene, really. I sleep great here.\n\nThe paved path is really nice for my morning walk. Every day I say hello to Nyoman the Coconut man, Wyann the artist, a series of people working in the rice fields, the art-shop owner at the front door, and the staff at a few restaurants along the way. Often I get a nice look at Mt. Agung or some of the other cinder cones in the distance. The wonderful Sweet Orange restaurant (5 stars on TA), right in the rice fields, is a 10 min walk. And all a 10 min walk from whatever stores you want in town \u2013 without the congestion.\n\nAs to the villas themselves\u2026\n\nAll are well-built with good internet, good kitchens, and good electricity. 3BR Solera is great if you have guests because there are two levels, each with its own living room. Great veranda with dining table for al fresco meals or watching the rain (more in the winter). 2BR Serena is right-sized for the two of us, the pool doesn\u2019t get much sun (which is what we like). Dining table is outside next to the pool and a great balcony with expansive views just outside the bedrooms upstairs. 3BR Santana has a wonderful open layout, a LR inside and nice chairs & couch outside as well, next to the pool. The views are more expansive here because it\u2019s on the end.\n\nYou can\u2019t go wrong staying at Satori Villas. They are wonderful!",

The villa itself is super clean with everything you need, Wayan and his team will help with questions and book things. We used the laundry service too which was excellent.\n\nJust be aware that the villa is accessed by the staff picking you up from the central parking on the back of scooters/motorcycles. You get used to it but it\u2019s pretty hair-raising to start with if you\u2019re not used to it.",

This Villa had 4 bedrooms and 4 partially outdoor bathrooms.  It was great for family, very comfortable and plenty of space.  A warm and friendly welcome from Ketut,Wayan and Putu.  You can arrange airport pick up from them and it was a seamless experience.  The location is excellent.  You can reach the villa on foot or by scooter only.  It is only 15 to 20 min walk down to town.  The villa nested around the rice paddies and we had delicious breakfast every morning made by Wayan and Putu.  This Villa is perfect for relaxation and enjoy the nature around you.  We look forward to coming back soon.  Thank you Ketut, Wayan and Putu took care us and spoiled us in those three weeks in Ubud Bali.",

At the end of our second visit, they felt so nearly like family that it was hard to say goodbye.\n2. The breakfasts were exceptional! Waking up to fresh-cut fruit AND a fresh fruit smoothie spoiled us. That these were followed by hot, fluffy, mildly spicy nasi goreng\u2026.? Heavenly way to start a day.\n3 . The setting, among rice paddies and palms, is so beautiful. You can point a camera in any direction and capture beauty. The pool and the well-tended landscaping (and the aforementioned rice paddy just beyond) make a feast for the eyes and an idyllic scene to really relax in. You feel privacy yet also an unconstrained openness . (The rooms\u2019 semi-outdoor showers provide the same paradoxical vibe.)\n4. Banana Villa is beautifully decorated with original art by the cream of (I think) local artists and handsome, comfortable, inviting furniture. Wife and I loved ending our eves in the ultra-cozy TV room.\n\n5. It\u2019s a brief walk to the elegant and un-toppable Luxe Grill for dinner!",

Lively Ubud Center is a short walk (or 3 minute scooter ride) from Satori Villas, down a country lane with shops, markets, spas, galleries and restaurants.  So much to explore!  We are just at the beginning of the famous Kajeng Ricefields walk, and you will find 8 restaurants within a 5 minute walk.  We hope to welcome you again soon, and send our best regards",

The full kitchen , outdoor dining area and private pool were wonderful. The staff were beyond amazing. We had the pleasure of  Wayan and Putu making us breakfast a few times and it was so delicious.  Up in the middle of rice fields yet a short walk down to the action. If you did not want to walk the staff would take you down by scooter but we always walked.  A seven minute walk to Sweet Orange Warung for great food.  We were spoiled for two weeks and hated to leave. ",

They make everything so easy from the pick up at the airport to the  amazingly attentive staff that clean daily, serve beautiful  breakfasts, arrange experiences, call in massage and beauty treatments right there in the Villa.  It rained for some of our evenings and the staff cooked wonderful dinners. A big plus is the Villas have filtered water throughout so you can drink right from the tap. We loved watching ducks and rice field life, and walking on the famous rice field walking path right outside our door. We enjoyed all the yoga options and the pool was heavenly. \nStay here, you\u2019ll love it!",

Located on rice fields at the outskirts of Ubud we were just a 5 min walk into town - a welcome buffer which added to the experience all around. The staff were very welcoming and easy to communicate with through whats app and in person. They received us late at night with scooters, and came daily to make us fresh breakfast (perfect every time), to clean and set beds if we wished. A beautiful place in a magical setting. Highly recommended. We are a group of 2 adults and 4 children from 9-14yrs old.",

The staff are fantastic, so welcoming, discreet and the villa was always spotless.  Thank you so much - we would love to return one day.  Definitely recommend Sweet Orange warung for lunch - so close and very pretty.",

There were some ants and lizards, but we liked to keep the door open, so that is to be expected. Close enough to the main city to walk easily, but staff was always willing to give a ride where we needed to go or pick us up at the bottom of the hill if tired. Very quiet and peaceful area to stay out of the main street's chaos. Breakfast was made to order in the villa. Check in was simple in the villa after staff brought us up on motorbikes. It was our first visit to Ubud and the welcome binder in the room gave us tips and recommendations to enjoy that were very useful. Can't recommend highly enough.",

Only a short (10mins) walk away from Ubud main street but another world away from the noise and crowds. The views over the rice fields were picture perfect making for a relaxing holiday. The staff are amazing - Wayan & Putu spoilt us with fabulous breakfasts each morning and the villa was always spotlessly cleaned. 5/5 from us! :)",

First of all, the staff were the most kind, caring, and attentive team--greeted us at the door and were helpful throughout our stay. \n\nIt's a luxury villa but attends to the local vibes... sparkling clean and decorated with fresh flowers, Balinese art, statues, and beautiful decor. \n\nWe have stayed in Ubud many times and think the location is the most ideal because though it feels tucked away in nature (with the sounds of birds and frogs and gorgeous rice field views) it's a hop, skip, and a jump from the downtown. There are a restaurants nearby (the Grille at Luxe, Sweet Orange Warung, and the cheery local sunset cafe with no name).\n\nThe swimming pool is HUGE and there are ample areas to rest, read, and lounge. We love the outdoor shower and jacuzzi overlooking the rice field, and breakfast was yummy and plenty!  Thank you Satori Villas, we'll definitely be coming back!",

              "text": "Spent 4 amazing months(2022 january-2022.may)in Villa Banana. We tried a lot of villa in Asia, but it was the best ever. Its not a trendy design villa but instead its an amazing house  where you can feel like at home! The decoration, the furnishing, the home appliances etc.are so well-thought-out. You can open the windows and sliding doors everywhere so the whole house is airy and bright. The decent size pool facing to ricefields in a beatiful garden, with 4 comfy sunbeds  and 2 parasols. It is a huge roofed outdoor area with table for six people and a lounge area too, with fans, so you can spend your time outdoor even in tropical rain. Every room has aircon and fan too. We didnt used aircon much(only in bedroom in the  evening), if you open every door, tropizal breeze go through the house. The kitchen is fully equipped,has everything what you need to cook/bake. The beds are extreme comfy. Every room has an own outdoor bathroom, but its roofed so you can use it in bad weather too.Water pressure is excellent.The toilet is special(septic system), so you cannot throw the toilet paper in it, you must throw in a dustbin,the staff empty it daily. The cleanness is top, it was cleaning 2 times per week, and it was really accurate with detergents, so its not the ordinary asian quality. The location is excellent. You can reach the villa only on foot or by scooter, but its only 5 minutes from the road where you can rent parking lot for your car or get a grab. And its 10min on foot from Ubud Palace. Bugs and wildlife: the villa is on the ricefileds but there was no problem(if you keep in my that you are in Bali\u2026) No rats,no cockroach,no rooster. There were gekkos and ducks and ants,and a few dogs but these dogs are pets not stray dogs. There was only a few mosquito. The villa is ideal for families or friends, but we really enjoyed that we were only two of us in the whole house, so its ideal for couples too. And the staff: Ketut and his wife Wayan lives next to the villa. They make everything, cleaning, gardening, pool maintenance etc., and they can help if you have any question or must organize something. They were really kind and helpful, polite, and made everything so, to disturb us least. So we like to thank for Ketut and Wayan their work, and for the Owner and Management that they dreamed and built a villa that perfect for everybody who want a home away from home. The photos cant present the villa well enough, so i\u2019ve uploaded a walk trough  video on you tube (search: Villa Banana(Satori Villas Ubud) walk trough). Absolutely 5* !!Hope we can back soon\u2026",

When you are here, it illuminates the feeling of home within you: the comfort, safety, uniqueness, the family community and the feeling of belonging.  \n\nWe have stayed at Villa Santana for an extended period of time and it has been the perfect 'home' to live in.  The villas are fully equipped with great attention to detail.  Each villa has its own unique layout and style surrounded by peaceful rice fields.  \n\nMaintenance and cleanliness is a priority at Satori Villa and can hardly be matched to other places we have stayed.  The staff and owners are completely amazing- so kind and welcoming as if you have known them for a long time.    Staying here will always have a special memory and place in my heart.  Thank you Satori Family.  Love Kim and John",

It was a wonderful place to watch a full season of rice cultivation\u2026 from the clearing of land, burning, tending of soil, propagation & planting, growth through rain, wind, & sun to harvest. The gardens & views are beautiful to watch the changing sky, beautiful birds, farmers, & cows throughout the day. The staff on hand, Wayan, Ketut, Komang, Dewi, Gek, & the others were all so helpful & accomodating of our needs & very friendly to deal with. The location is great to walk the nearby rice fields as well as into town (or bike / motorcycle if you prefer). I would stay here again & felt very safe during covid times. Highly recommended",

We stayed in Villa Banana for one month and Villa Serena for 5 months. We couldn't have chosen a more peaceful, beautiful and comfortable place to stay. The service and staff was remarkable by every standard. The manager Wayan made sure our every need was addressed and was so friendly. We would like to thank the staff members Komang, Gek Putri, DewaAyu, and everyone else for our wonderful stay. We will definitely be returning. We can't wait to come back! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd",

Everything is beautifully decorated with many personal touches.  It was wonderful to take a dip in the private pool surrounded by the lush greenery, in the perfectly manicured garden.

I would describe our time as an \"experience\", rather than a holiday! \n\nLocated in a car-free section north of the Ubud hubbub, it's a mere 6-7 minute walk to Jl. Ubud, yet surrounded by \"real\" Bali - something all but gone from the western coastal areas. A scooter is optional, but it sure makes it fun! :)\n\nThe staff are charming and plentiful, to say the least and nothing is a problem. Ask Komang's Dad for a fresh coconut ... just awesome :)\n\nKasey and Rico's visitor guide was the most comprehensive I've ever seen and we sampled many of its suggestions - breakfasts at Milk & Madu and Kafe, walks through the rice paddies and up along the Ridge, local dinners at Samara, one of the best pizzas we've tasted from the local Italian (home delivered in a tropical downpour) and the pinnacle of our dining - the Luxe (do NOT miss this!). Did I mention yoga at the Yoga House?. \n\nWe are already planning a return trip - next time will have to be longer than our painfully short, three nights.\n\nWe highly recommend these villas.",

The staff were  so helpful, and every  attention  to detail was met to make for a wonderful  60th birthday  celebrations Balinese  banquet cooked right  in the villa for 10 ppl. Wayan even  remembered my husband  loved  pineapple, which was lovingly  put in his complementary birthday  cake. A floral  happy birthday  message  was layed out in the villa from rose petals. Our guests  loved  the villa and the cooked breakfast  and yummy  banana  pancakes and fresh fruit and smoothies  added to our holiday  recharge. This place had it all, volcano  views, rice  fields so serene. We will be back thankyou  so much for making  RAYS 60th  birthday celebrations  & recharge AMAZING!! Oh and Satori drivers  were exceptional  too, taking us to the most  incredible  authentic  Balinese  restaurant  for lunch  on the way to ubud. We loved  the moped rides through the green zone. Fridge  was well stocked  with refreshments  daily. We are now planning  another  holiday  60th birthday celebrations in 2021. Can't  wait ..cheers Maria",

              "text": "We stayed at Villa Satori (yes there is a villa named after its business name) at Satori Villas. We didn't utilize the extra guesthouse since we only had 4 people, but this was the only unit available during the time we visited and we are very glad we stayed there (and will stay again next time). Very comfortable, luxurious accommodations, with plenty of space, air conditioning, a beautiful private pool, and amazing views from the outdoor dining patio and master bedroom balcony. We did not see anyone else other than our villa staff while we were on the property, even though I know the other villas were booked. And the location is very quiet and peaceful (other than sounds of nature). It was rejuvenating to wake up every morning to a breathtaking sunrise, and the distant sounds of crickets, crowing roosters, and quacking ducks. Our villa was huge (and we checked out but did not use the guest house, which was beautiful too). Gorgeous, well-sized pool with a lot of privacy. Since this was our first trip to Bali, we were gone most of the day sightseeing and so did not spend a ton of time in the villa except in the evenings. It would make a very restful and relaxing vacation to stay and spend time lounging around the next time we visit Bali (with more pool time and massages, etc.). The staff is what makes Satori Villas really special. Incredibly helpful and kind, with delicious breakfasts made to order each morning. They helped us arrange laundry service (and everything came back clean and neatly folded), and also had (per our request) fresh, chilled coconuts waiting for us in the fridge to enjoy after a long day out. Sure, the lodging is lovely and the location private and quiet, but it's the staff that makes it stand out. Regarding some of the negative reviews, yes - it's a tropical location and in the middle of a rice paddy, so lots of flying insects at nighttime, only if you're outside or have your windows open then. None during the day, and very few mosquitos (I don't think we ever saw one indoors), so they must be managing those pretty well. We did see a few (3 over 4 days) small geckos inside the villa, on the walls (to be expected in a tropical location), and had no issues with them whatsoever. For those familiar with staying in Hawaii, it's similar in that sense with the geckos and insects, which are not related to cleanliness, etc. As for the location, it would be challenging for folks with mobility issues to walk between the city to the villas (it's a 10-min walk with a climb), but we enjoyed the peaceful walk. And our teen boys loved the scooter rides, which were fast and fun (and the staff very skilled and safe). We typically preferred to take the beautiful walk most of the time though. Again, it really was the wonderful staff who made our visit extraordinary - Wayan welcomed us warmly and made delicious breakfasts. She helped arrange laundry and was resourceful with our many questions (and the free cellphone provided came in very handy). Ketut was kind and helpful with our belongings and an expert scooter driver, Wayan Vera was cheerful and also made us delicious breakfasts. We hope to be back again soon.",

Komang came in the morning with groceries and cooked a delicious made to-order breakfast in the Villa kitchen. It was truly a luxurious experience. I will definitely be back and stay again.",

Add to that the tasteful decor, good amenities, and a hearty breakfast, and you've got a place that you never want to leave from. We were 5 of us and sadly we only stayed for 2 days but was that memorable! \nYes, one could say that accessibility was a bit of an issue but that's what was the best part of the villa - it's aloofness. And whenever needed, the staff was more than helpful to drop us off to the centre. \nA gem for nature lovers - and that pool!!",

              "text": "Coming back to Villa Siri is like stepping into Eden - I immediately relax and stay so for my entire time there.  Thank you again to the fabulous team that make a stay so special - Komang your smile only seems to get bigger and bigger - let alone the lovey villa.  For those that have never stayed - don't hesitate to book - the pictures on the website and here do not do it justice, no comments can either - but will try.  Look at the website.\n\nLOCATION:  Part of what makes Satoria Villas/Villa Siri special is the location in the rice fields away from the total madness of Ubud main area.   Only scooters are allowed on the walkways for the last few hundred meters.  Therefore traffic noise is minimal.   And you can either make the walk, or phone the staff to come and collect you from the street, or run you down.  I have never used that service (apart from arrival and departure) - as I love the walk up and down - there is a little bit of a rise in one area - but nothing you need any fitness training for.\n\nCOCONUTS:  On the walk to the Villa you will find a great fresh coconut stand which Komang parents owns.  Best fresh coconut on the island - and Nyoman is lovely enough to deliver to the villa (and that was daily).  Cold coconut juice - can't beat it!\n\nVILLA:  I love Siri - bedroom/bathroom downstairs, living / kitchen balcony upstairs - perfect to watch the rice grown, ducks waddle and cow graze.   Has its own small pool (think the others have larger ones) which is under cover so always cold.\n\nPHONE:  You are provided with a local phone on arrival to contact the staff if needed.\n\nFOOD:  The breakfast is lovely.  Great choice and served when you want it.  Due to my schedule I usually just get fruit and smoothie left in the fridge - but the days I had a proper breakfast were lovely.    Full cooking facilities if needed - but why........ so many great places nearby and the staff will cook a meal for you (if 2+).\n\nCLEANLINESS:  Never stayed in a placed that is so clean.  The staff come in every day and linen to changed every 3/4 days.  Yes there are a few of the usual tropical ants that are around if you do not clean something up.\n\nWATER:   You can now drink the tap water here - which is great (and not usual for Bali).    Also cheap and easy to buy anywhere if you are out and about, but suggest you bring your own water bottle and fill up.\n\nLAUNDRY:  You don't need to bring a lot of clothes as local laundry which the staff will arrange to have done is cheap and quick.  Just don't put any 'quality' clothes in - hand wash those yourselves.\n\nLOCAL DINNING:   Luxe about 2 minutes walk about is a great place for high end quality food - the Calamari is the best I have had anywhere in the world.    Sweet Orange Warung is a local place serving basic cheap hugely tasty food - try the mixed entree platter to get you started.  Then so many places in Ubud itself..........\n\nYOGO:  My go to is Ubud Yoga House, easy walk via the town or the rice fields (weather dependent).  Highly recommend it.\n\nAIRPORT TRANSFERS:  Book through Satori - if you didn't know where you were coming to the first time it might be confusing.  This way easy and cheap.  Is about 1.5 hours travel time from Airport.\n\nTIP:  If you have a late evening/afternoon departure - book that night as well - as then you can shower just before you leave for the airport etc.",

The location was also phenomenal amongst the rice patties while still walking distance to downtown Ubud.\n\nWhat really sets apart Satori Villas is the staff! We were treated like royalty and really appreciated the extra care, whether is was the breakfast adjusted to our requests, suggestions and coordinating of activities in the area, or just general availability for any and every request.\n\nWould highly recommend arranging the dinner cooked by the in-house staff. It was a favorite activity for all of us! ",

Every day started with a swim before breakfast, then sipping dragon fruit smoothies while watching the birds and ducks in their morning rituals. Breakfast is made to your liking, and we loved our mango pancakes and poached eggs. One of our favorite things was to take a cooking class in the rice fields which was so close to the Villa. There are many small restaurants and shops within a 10 minute walk, and we found it easier in cooler to shop on the Satori Village Street ( Jalan Kajeng)  than at the market, and with better prices!\nWe love the ladies on this friendly street, and had them do some custom work for us. Every need was looked after by the helpful staff, from changing money to picking us up after a long day of sightseeing. Satori Villas is our new home away from home, and we plan to return again next year.",

              "text": "My absolute favorite place to stay in Ubud! Villa Satori has the friendliest staff and the most beautiful views of the rice fields! I love the pool area so much and recommend watching the sunrise there in the early morning. Breakfast is delicious and comes with a fresh smoothie. I enjoyed walking into town in the afternoon-(although the staff will drop you by motorbike if you wish). Downtown Ubud is busy and often noisey so it's nice to be nestled in the rice fields where it is quiet. There are many cute shops along the Villa's street that have similar items the market does but at a cheaper price FYI. It was so lovely to shop locally and then return for a dip in the gorgeous pool to cool off! So private and relaxing. We took several day trips with driver Gede- he was very friendly and answered any/all questions we had about the area as well as curious cultural questions. We took a jewelry making class and visited a beautiful waterfall all near Ubud. We also took a cooking class at D'charik Warung about a 5-minute walk from the Villa through the rice fields! It was one of the highlights of our trip and so nice to be walking distance to such a fun class. Ubud has so many food options but it was easy for us to find the absolute best spots based on the restaurant recommendations in the Villa's guide. This is my second time staying with Satori Villas and I can't wait to go back :)",

Good breakfast. We were in one bed villa. The small private pool doesn\u2019t really get any sun so it is a little chilly and there is no area to lay beside pool but many other great aspects that overcome this. ",

A few comments for feedback for improvement- the mattress is in need of an upgrade- a pillow top would be great. Some pool toys for the kids would also be appreciated. The staff appear unannounced through the front gate in the morning (to sweep around the pool) and late afternoon to light incense and lay offerings- I got quite a shock when a man just appeared at my outdoor dining area - having let himself in. There is no warning of this, nothing in the hotel information folder. I think you should inform people that privacy is not guaranteed in the outdoor area.",

              "text": "I wholeheartedly recommend Satori villas to anyone planning a trip to Ubud. It is a special place, and at this point it may be still a \u201chidden gem\u201d but I can\u2019t imagine it will stay hidden much longer!\n\nMy mother and sister joined me here for 4 blissful nights in Villa Serena, and knowing what we know now, we will book for longer next time!  So, a few highlights\n\nThe Villa itself is stunningly decorated with Balinese art, and was equipped with everything we needed for a comfortable holiday (including the well-stocked minibar with local treats, beers and wines). They have a special filter system which means you can drink the tap water - a rare luxury in Bali. Beds and high quality linens were very comfortable, and yes they have mosquito nets (good for my nervous mother) but I think I only saw like one mosquito during my entire stay. The private outdoor pool area was great for relaxing after a hot day, and the surrounding garden is lush and vibrant and helps to make the space feel very private. \n\nThe location is 400m off of Jalan Kajeng along a rice paddy trail. What this means is that the villa feels surrounded by nature and peace among the paddies, while in reality Ubud central is only a short walk away... Though instead of walking we usually had the staff drop us to one of the main streets by motorbike. We were nervous at first but quickly came to look forward to these short thrill rides!\n\nAmong the paddies themselves we had easy access to 2 or 3 restaurants within 5 minutes walking distance. We really enjoyed our dinner at nearby Luxe grille. \n\nThere was a useful information book in the villa, which gives loads of information on activities and restaurants, in addition to introducing some aspects of Balinese culture and customs (and how not to act a fool by pointing with your index finger!). We really appreciated that information and enjoyed reading it. I can confirm that the restaurant recommendations we tried were top notch.\n\nRight from the start the staff treated us with such kindness. They were some of the most warm hearted people we met in Bali, and they would go above and beyond to meet any request. \nThis includes Gede, their main driver. We felt very privileged to spend two days touring with him. He has much local expertise, and is honest and kind. He knows the off-the-beaten-path spots, the best lunch stopovers, and he knew just where to get the good quality woodcarving I was after. \n\nWe stayed there only a week ago and everyday since leaving we have reminisced about how wonderful it was. This may actually be my favourite place I\u2019ve ever stayed. Thanks to everyone at the villas for making it so special for us.",

              "text": "Wow, the villa I stayed in (Villa Santana) was incredible. Those views to wake up to every morning, surrounded by rice fields was unbelievable. And then also to be able to sit outside on the patio by the private pool and have rice fields on all three sides of you just made for such a serene and beautiful experience. And one of the funny parts was watching the family of ducks quacking their way around the fields, all in a row, father, mother, and string of little babies behind them.\nAnd while you are right in the middle of all that nature, I would have assumed there might be bugs, insects, etc.. in the villa, but there really weren't any at all. The villa itself is incredibly modern, the AC in every room works great, WiFi is solid. And then the staff are so warm and friendly and attentive to whatever you need. Just ask and they will provide with a smile. Breakfast provided every morning and there is a restaurant right next door that will deliver lunch or dinner from their menu whenever you want. Really made the stay that much more enjoyable. Will most certainly be back!! And many more times!!!! Thank you all so much!!!!!:)",

The villas are beautiful, the gardens are exquisite and the staff are something else. I believe the staff (Komang, Ngurah, Desak, Arya - I\u2019m sure I have forgotten a few, but thank you so much!) make Satori Villas so special. They go out of their way to ensure you have an amazing time - from the beautiful breakfasts cooked in your villa to the cleanliness of the villa & their expert scooter skills!!  There are numerous good restaurants within walking distance of the villas which is great, or it is just a short walk into town. The villas are surrounded by peaceful rice fields with vocal ducks for company and lots of beautiful birds. \nIt is quite simply, the most wonderful place to be.",

We've stayed numerous times over the years and it is always a highlight of our time in Bali. It is just  magical sitting on the top deck overlooking the rice paddies with Mt Agung in the background. Make sure you have at least one massage from Wayan, who the staff will contact to come to the villa.\nThe villa itself is huge and the garden in front of the guest house is a tropical oasis - perfect for late-night swims before heading to bed.\nThe wonderful staff have become friends and arriving at Satori does feel like coming home. This time they went to the trouble of writing  out a welcome message in flower petals on the floor in the main entrance.\nThere have been a couple of changes since our last stay. Apart from the fresh new staff uniforms, there is now also a mini bar stocked with well priced drinks and snacks. If you don't feel like venturing out to one of Ubud's many excellent restaurants, the staff can cook up an Indonesian feast on request.\nFour  nights seemed to go nowhere and we are already looking forward to returning early next year. For us, there is nowhere better to stay in Ubud.",

              "text": "There are so many choices in Ubud, but this was certainly a great one. We really liked the location in the rice fields but 5 minutes from the hussle and bustle. The villas are individual and private.The staff really make it, they provide you a mobile phone and were there in an instant to take us to / from town. Vera prepared a fab breakfast to order daily, and we had a bespoke meal in one evening in which was superb. Probably the most relaxed i have been in a long time.  \n\nJust beware for some the fact its a 10 minute walk from the main road to the Palace / Starbucks. The path is concrete / tarmacked so easy to walk with a few shops, warangs and stalls on the way. The staff provide a free transfer by moped for your during your stay and deal with your bags so its not an issue and you call using the mobile they provide. Useful for booking restaurants etc also, or calling your driver. \n\nLaundry was incredibly cheap and wonderfully done same day ironed etc. No downsides apart from ducks waking you early in the rice fields!",

              "text": "We recently spent 4 nights in Villa Banana at Satori and we were so impressed. A huge, spacious villa with big bedrooms and plenty of space, really comfortable pillows and beds. Huge dining/living area, plus entertainment room. Lovely outdoor bathrooms. The outdoor area was great for socialising as we had friends and family staying in other villas at Satori. The pool at Villa Banana is a good size. Wayan and Ketut were amazing and their service was faultless. Every morning Wayan would come and cook us a delicious breakfast, complete with fruit platters and smoothies, fresh coffee and tea. Wayan cooked us a beautiful Indonesian meal one night. \n\nWe loved the area, away from the hustle and bustle of the main street. The last 100 metres or so can't be reached by car but Wayan and Ketut would just come and collect us or drop us into town on their scooters when we needed, my kids loved this adventure! We walked into town a couple of times as that is downhill, we did walk up it once and it's manageable but does make for a hot walk!\n\nI honestly couldn't fault a single thing about the accommodation or the service. I'd love to stay here again but this time I'd stay a week so I could have some more pool time!",

Our dedicated staff take great pride in providing intuitive and gracious guest services, and we truly enjoy sharing our beautiful Satori oasis with our guests.  Everyone wishes they could tuck pocket-size Wayan into their suitcases and take her home!\n\nAs you mentioned, our location is in a Green Zone, and cars are not allowed the last 100 metres.  Our staff are on hand any time 24/7 to whisk you and your family to/from town if you choose not to walk.  We have even had several adventurous elders who had their wheelchairs pushed up the incline by our staff!  All in all, we are here to help in any way ---plan waterfall adventures, organize transport or shopping itineraries, in-villa massages, special occasions or dinners, yoga classes, early morning market trips---just let us know what you would like to do. We are able to handle 34+ guests in our villas:  large family groups, girlfriend getaways, wedding parties, or retreats.\n\nWe look forward to your return visit, at least a week this time, and will plan to spoil you all again the Satori Way!  Very best from all of us at Satori Villas Bali x",

Waking up to the sound of the ducks every morning was the best. The staff were amazing, we didn\u2019t need to do anything. Their banana pancakes were yum! \nThank you all.

Location couldn't be better. Yet a short scooty ride of 5 min away to the main town square from where everything is walking distance. One could even take a 15 min walk to the town instead of the scooty. Its doable but one gets lazy.\nExtremely courteous and helpful all-in-one team of staff.\nWill definitely be back one day.",

We've stayed elsewhere in Ubud over the years, but for us, nowhere has come close.\nSurrounded by rice paddies at the start of the Juwuk Manis walk, Satori is in a prize location close to the centre of town but a world away from the traffic mayhem of the main drag.\nThe beautifully decorated villa just has a wonderful relaxed feel to it, with an upstairs master bedroom opening onto a deck with views to Mt Agung. It's a great spot for an afternoon massage (Ask the staff to contact Wayan Shanty).\nDownstairs is the kitchen and lounge, which also opens onto a covered outdoor breakfast area overlooking the gardens, pool and quest house (A free standing one-bedroom 'villa' facing onto the pool).\nThe villa  is well maintained and spotlessly clean. The staff,  Wayan, Ketut and Vera, are all awesome. They will happily ferry you to the main road on a scooter if you can't face the walk into town. Breakfast is provided but the staff will cook other meals on request. \nThe whole Villa Satori experience is impossible to fault.\nWe're already planning our next stay and can't wait for another after-dinner dip in that magical pool.",

The staff is lovely, very helpful and prepares tasty breakfasts!\nWe very much enjoyed our stay in Satori Villas.",

We enjoyed having our breakfast prepared by the staff on the terrace overlooking the pool and the rice fields beside the villa. Service was excellent. The only drawback is that the villa is not accessible by car. Although it is only a 2-3 minute scooter ride or an 8-10 minute walk from the central parking area to the villa, this is not ideal for families with infants, toddlers and older adults. However, the friendly and efficient staff were always available to bring us to and from the villa by scooter.",

              "text": "If you want to be off the main drag, overlooking rice fields, yet close to some shops, cafes and local life, Satori Villas are a great choice. We stayed in Villa Serena (2 bed) and Villa Satori (3 bed). Both are stunning and beautifully appointed with everything you could want. The staff are typical of the absolutely lovely Ubud people. Nothing is too much trouble for them, they are patient, hard working and always smiling. \n\nVilla Serena, as the name suggests, is a little more serene, being slightly further from the scooters zooming up and down the laneway that leads to Ubud. Indoors, Serena has a lovely airy spacious feel, with a large shared balcony overlooking the rice fields - fabulous for massages with a backdrop of bird sounds and water flowing over the pool's infinity edge. \n\nVilla Satori would be ideal for a family with 2 children and perhaps grandparents who can stay in the charming guesthouse on the opposite side of the huge pool, away from the lane. The main bedroom is exquisite with large ensuite, balcony and jacuzzi, overlooking the beautiful garden and rice fields beyond. The twin bedroom closer to the lane would be great for kids. \n\nEspecially charming were the ducks waddling around in the field next to Villa Satori, walks through the fields to meet the locals, and the 'coconut man', stationed on the lane very close to the villas. He will climb a tree to grab you a fresh coconut and chop it open for you. \n \nIt's worth foregoing total privacy to have the lovely staff visit with the traditional Bali Hindu offerings and taking care of your every need. And while you do need to walk or take a scooter ride into the town, it means your surroundings are free of cars!",

They helped us with whatever we needed, from transport, to carry my little boy around when he cut his foot. The manager checking in this us throughout the night when my little boy feel ill, prepared to call us a doctor whenever we needed. It was so comforting to know we were surrounded with care and advise and weren't trying to navigate a foreign country alone.\nSatori have drivers that know all the \"must see\" sights and are all custom tailored to your needs, they were so great.\nSatori offer meals that the staff prepare for you, also tailored to your needs. The staff were always happy to bring us fresh eggs and fruit from the market. Their Indonesian meals were amazing \nThe villas are stylish yet comfortable, it feels like home away from home. \nThe views are amazing, its hard to believe when you look around at the rice fields that you are only a short distance from the hustle and bustle of Ubud.\nMy favourite part other than the amazing sunrises and sunsets were waking up to the sounds of the insects, the duck, the roosters and the cows, and being waved at by the farmers in the rice fields ! its magical\n\nThank you Satori for taking such great care of us and making us feel part of your family :)",

The staff were terrific, you see a lot of them because they cook you breakfast and they take you down to the main part of town on scooter. The staff also looked after our 2 children while we went out for a few hours together and they had a lovely time. We would stay there again. I don't really like going on the scooters but cars cannot get to the villa and I felt as safe as I am ever going to feel on a motor bike.",

All the bedrooms have their own lovely bathroom. \n\nThe pool and outdoor area is amazing with beautiful views of the rice paddy fields.\n\nWayan and Ketut were on-site to help us with everything, including lifts down the road so we didn\u2019t have to walk as far. Wayan also makes a lovely breakfast.\n\nThey organised yoga, massages and facials at the villa which was quite special (and didn\u2019t cost much at all).\n\nI\u2019d highly recommend this villa for a family or group of friends. It\u2019s about a 10 min walk into central Ubud and only taxi bikes are permitted to the door. Worth bearing in mind if any of your group isn\u2019t so mobile.\n\n",

              "text": "We had a fantastic 3 night stay in Villa Serena (2 bedroom). The staff were extremely accommodating, they happily picked us up/dropped us off by scooter to town (although the walk really is lovely and not all that far). The location is spectacular and you really do feel a world away from it all. The villa is huge with your own yard and pool (see the rest of my post though), so if it\u2019s space you are after then this is the place for you! The drawback for us with this particular villa (I think Serena is the only one) was that the staff quarters were attached to it - within our yard. This meant it never really felt private, which was one of the main reasons we booked a villa. Our gate was left open all day for staff to come and go. On one day another guest even came into our yard looking for the staff. The rest of the stay was amazing, so I guess it just depends on how important privacy in a villa is to you. ",

              "text": "From the moment I arrived at Banana Villa I felt I could stay in paradise forever.  My family of three and I stayed a wonderful week and it\u2019s etched  in my mind for a lifetime. Some of my favorite memories are getting up before the rest of the family and listening to the local morning sounds of roosters in the distance and the calls of the birds in the Plumaria tree near the pool. There was time for yoga by the pool and quiet reflection before Wayan would arrive to open the sliding glass doors for the day. She would then effortlessly prepare my fruit smoothie made from banana and dragon fruit and then begin a beautiful breakfast to our specifications.  \nWe found so much to do close by.  The beautiful rice field walk is just outside the door and we walked to the Pyramid Sound Healing from there.  We found walking to town charming and would often stop five minutes down the path for a massage or foot rub just to start the day! Continuing down the lane to what we called \u2018our street\u2019  we met each and every vendor and bought fabric, clothing, hats, robes and even had custom made cushion covers made.\nFor evening entertainment and restaurants The welcome notes are invaluable, but one of the best meals was right at the Villa. \nWe were there when it rained each day and so we\u2019d take the Villas umbrellas and off we\u2019d go   The shopping in Ubud is so much fun and if we\u2019d have too many packages to carry we\u2019d just call Ketut on the phone the villa provides, and he\u2019d meet us in minutes on his bike and take our packages home for us.  \nThe Villa\u2019s driver, Gede,  took us for a day trip for a water temple experience. Gede is very knowledge about all things  Bali and we asked questions about everything from architecture to rituals.  \nWe even had Wayan arrange for a beautiful young local dancer come and dance for us. She showed my daughter how to apply the dancer\u2019s make up and some of the eye and neck movements. The Balinese dancing is amazing to see so up close and Putri is a young, beautiful, totally proficient dancer.  We loved it and made arrangements to go to the  dining and dancing at the Lotus Cafe which is just a quick right turn after going down our street. Everything is so close by.  \nBut if you want to stay and enjoy pure bliss,  just have the staff arrange for a massage at the Villa.  You can swim and relax while waiting for the massage tables to be set up and right there in perfect Banana Villa you can drift into nirvana. \n\nWe\u2019re already planning our next trip back !",

Your family was full of life and a lot of fun to host--ready for anything and so interested in the unique Bali culture.  Your interest and enthusiasm makes your visit so much more special, as you understand some of the rituals that make Bali Hinduism so special!  Walking into town along our street lined with shops, galleries is a special experience, and you will meet the locals and see their wares.  Stop in at Threads of Life, grab a bite at Savannah Moon, then have a coffee at Starbucks.  It is all at your fingertips, but the villas are far enough away from the bustle of Ubud to be quiet and serene!  We look forwrad to your return in May!",

They are all very impressive, and spacious. Banana Villa is much larger then it seems in the photos. The breakfast is delicious and the turn down service is timely. The walk into the main street in Ubud is lined with coffee shops and boutiques and wonderful massage boutiques. The food in Ubud is really impressive, specifically the Italian Place walking  7 min from the villa. The Pool at Banana is always cool during the hot days and is such a refreshing way to cool down. The viewThe Villa is only 45 min from the airport in Denpasar. Side note Luxe hotel is down the street, I was told they have a beautiful wine selection, and killer eggs Benedict. We stayed 6 of us and felt very comfortable with the amount of space at banana, we could have stayed at any of the villas and felt comfortable. Watching the wind blow through the rice patties simply never gets old. Also Fresh Coconuts can be delivered daily.",

              "text": "Our stay at Satori Villas was wonderful! Transportation from the airport to the property was easily arranged and so appreciated after our long flight from CA. We were welcomed by staff who anticipated our every need. We needed to get money changed and a staff member was able to quickly motorbike to a nearby money changer. He knew of a place with the best rate and returned quickly with our money. Very fast, efficient and trustworthy staff! \n\nThe food at Satori Villas is so fresh and yummy! Each morning we had a delicious breakfast outside on our serene patio overlooking the rice paddies. We enjoyed the atmosphere and food so much we arranged to have a dinner at the Villa one evening cooked in house! We created a plant-based menu to fit our group's specific dietary needs and I was so pleased to see the produce was washed with filtered water. Each meal we had was so well prepared and truly a delight!\n\nWe were also pleased with our short walk to the bustling streets of Ubud! Along the road to the downtown area are many shops, restaurants and spas that we visited throughout our stay. The walk is lovely. We enjoyed taking in all that the quiet local street had to offer as well as the bustling Ubud streets. \n\nOverall our experience at Satori Villas exceeded our expectations! We are planning a return very soon and can't wait to share the Villa Satori experience with more friends and family.",

Many of our local shops have better prices than Ubud market, and are far less crowded!  If you have bought too much to carry, just call on the provided cell phone - we are happy to come pick up you and your bags any time.  We anticipate your return soon and will welcome you back with open arms and a fresh mango smoothie!",

              "text": "Beautiful villa. Nice breakfast, Friendly staff.\n\nBut, it's not a 10 minute walk from town in any stretch of imagination... AND walking is your only option!\n\nNot suitable for young children, old people, special needs, or any kind of walking disability.\n\nHere's the real tick: Not only does the location of this villa requires you to walk uphill on a steep narrow path (good luck when it's raining!) for about 7 minutes, but the owners of the villa think it's a great idea to make you walk another 10-15 to a parking lot far away. Completely unnecessarily as every other driver in town (that doesn't work for the villa), will take you to the bottom of the hill (where you 'just' need to climb up another 5-7 minutes). And remember, you'll do that when you first arrive, tired from your flight and drive, with your luggage. (They'll send someone to pick up the luggage on a scooter, but not you.)\n\nSo, don't believe the part about distance. If you're not planning on renting your own scooters for everyone in your group, bring your walking shoes!\n\nThey do offer to take you to the nearest starbucks (on the main road) on their scooter, but you can imagine the inconvenience every time if you're 6-8 people (normal in a 4 bedroom villa).\n\nFor some people, that's not a problem, but not divulging this information before accepting a booking? that's a serious problem!\n\nTo end on a good note, the staff are very friendly and make a real effort to help, there's a nice kitchen (as long as you do very light cooking... only 1 pot), there's a DVD player (but no movies), Cable (but HBO and such movies and series channels aren't subscribed to), and the breakfast is nice.",

When you and your family first arrived at the drop off point, you were asked if you would like a scooter ride to the villa before your bags were taken.  You declined.  It must have been a miscommunication, as it is mentioned several times as an option should you choose not to walk.  Many of our guests opt to walk, as it is such a beautiful walk (and at the start of the very popular Juwuk Manis Ricefields walk).  Our street is considered one of the most charming lanes in Ubud, lined with galleries, shops, spas and restaurants.  If there are 6 of you all wanting to go at the same time, some may need to wait 5 minutes while the others are given rides, as this is a part of Bali life everywhere. \n~There is definitely a sloping hill that goes to the rice fields on the way to the villa, and it is approximately 3 minutes uphill of the walk on the 2m wide path. You are rewarded with no cars, clean air, and authentic unhurried village atmosphere.  It is 10-12 minutes by stopwatch from the villa to Starbucks.  We have had guests in wheelchairs who were pushed up and slowly down the slope by our staff and they enjoyed it as \"adventure\".  We do say 'not recommended for those with mobility issues' in the extensive Welcome Notes that were sent to you.\n~Most of our guests are families, and many have young children.\n~The huge Western style gourmet kitchen is fully equipped with everything you could possibly want to cook with, including 7 pots and pans of all sizes, a blender, hand mixer, rice cooker, and an espresso machine. You must not have looked in all the cabinets.\n~There is indeed a DVD player, and sitting right on top of it is a DVD holder with selection of 45 movies, and there are more in the drawer directly below.\n~The large flat screen TV in the separate TV lounge has a satellite selection of 114 channels, and apologies your favorites were not among them.  \n\nAgain, we thank you for staying with us and hope you will have lovely memories of Bali.\n\n",

And still only 10-12 minutes walk to the main Ubud shopping and dining precinct.  The staff were fabulous and always ready to help.  Having breakfast cooked in our villa each morning was excellent.  The restaurant in the next villa complex just 3 minutes walk away along the path was a bonus.  I would definitely recommend Satori Villas.",

The view from the balcony is breathtaking and I really recommend doing the rice paddy walk which is just outside the door! Staff were so attentive and pleasant and the villa itself was lovely. A generous breakfast is cooked for you in the morning for you to enjoy and they provide you with a phone to contact the staff which is really handy. The plunge pool was quite cold as it was shaded so you couldn\u2019t really be in there for more than a couple of minutes (the only downside). We also got a bit lost trying to find the place in which we were later told there was a pickup service down in Ubud centre. We definitely did not mind the walk at all (our taxi got us all the way up to where he could) but we weren\u2019t made aware of this service before our stay.",

We had many massages, facials etc in our villas , spent hours relaxing and chatting around the picturesque pool with view of the lush rice paddies. The villas are clean , beds comfortable and the staff excellent. Also the gardens are beautiful and well maintained.\nOur days began with a cooked to order breakfast and we all felt very spoiled. Then our villa was cleaned and beds made. \nIt is a 1.5 km walk into the centre of ubud , we enjoyed the walk but the offer of a lift on a motor scooter by the staff is always there. A couple of times we went shopping and called the manager on the cell phone he provided to organise someone to pick it up for us. There are some lovely walks through the rice paddies and numerous cafes bars and restaurants nearby if the walk into town was too daunting. Also , the local restaurant delivers if you want to eat in.\nWe all want to return with our families to Satori. I will remember this week fondly.",

We located this gem on trip advisor about 6 years ago but were unable to stay then due to them already being booked. \n\nWhen we decided to return to Bali in 201; we were able to get into Satori & since then there is no turning back. Satori & it\u2019s staff are simply \u201cour home away from home\u201d!  There is nowhere else I would even staying. Yes, there are many options one can choose to stay, but the staff make this place so special. \n\nIt\u2019s disappointing to read a negative review  (sorry if I offend but not super surprised it\u2019s by an American - likely no understanding of Bali & their practices & perhaps they are better suited for Hawaii) as anyone who knows the Balinese wools know they do not have a dishonest bone in their body. \n\nPlease ignore the 2% & open your mind the the 98% who are giving truly honest reviews. If you stay at Satori you will not regret it & I guarantee you will leave a part of your heart behind.",

Our 6th time to Bali& so glad we have discovered Villa Satori.  A gem in the rice paddies away from the hustle & bustle of Ubud.  It us like coming home again with each visit.",

Being tucked away in the rice paddies and located in a Green Zone makes for fresh clean air and no traffic jams...just serenity and the magic of Bali as you would like it to be.  You are so welcomed, yet privacy is yours if you wish.  Enjoy the early morning at Ubud Market, walk and marvel at the lush green rice fields, soak up the sun at your private pool, enjoy mouth watering, fresh meals, laze around all day...or have a private in-villa massage!  Please come home to Satori again soon.",

I, Arya, graciously explained everything to you today.\n\nOnce again, I apologize for the error we made taking you to the reservations office when this was not necessary for your reservation with Orbitz. As I explained to you, this is the first reservation we have received from Orbitz for our property and there was some confusion on the check in procedure.\n\nHere are some facts for your reference:\n\n1. It is the Banking Rules in Indonesia that we verify the credit card you used to remotely pay for your reservation. The same as if you purchase for an airline ticket on line, must present that card when you check in for your flight to verify the card. However in the case of an Orbitz reservation, this procedure is not necessary since Orbitz pays us for your reservation.\n\n2. It is the obligation by Indonesian Law that every property in Bali registers every guest with the police. This requires each guests passport information. This is protection for the guests staying in Indonesia. Every hotel will require a copy of your passport.\n\nWe have built our business on integrity for eight years. Our business is creating a wonderful holiday experience for every guest arriving at Satori Villas Bali, as the majority of our reviews reflect. We are human, as are you, we made an error on your arrival by asking you twice to copy your passport and once to verify your credit card. \n\nWe are all extremely disappointed that you are so harshly & inappropriately accusing me, our company & our lovely dedicated staff of fraud, when this was NOT the case at all, a baseless accusation. One error in asking you for your passport information twice leads you to believe we are fraudulent? We will move on to our mission to be better tomorrow than we were today, remaining focused on our passion to create exceptional experiences for all our Satori guests.

              "text": "Spent 4 nights in Villa Siri, absolutely loved it.  We had pre-booked transport from Sanur so were greeted by Wayan.  On arrival in Ubud we were then met by the staff from the Villa, Deshat, Boudi and I cannot remember the other young man, all very friendly and transferred us to the villa by scooter.  What scenery.  I was a little worried at first as the ride up seemed quite long and I thought the 10-15minute walk others had described might have been pushing it but my fears were allayed when we did the walk after arrival.  It is a little over 1km to the main street, there is a steep incline at one point but it is all in shade and if you go slow it is not a problem.  Breakfast was included and available any time from 7am.  The lovely Deshat cooked us up great omlettes and pancakes and the fruit smoothies were divine.  We did the rice terrace walk from the villa, so tranquil and what views. Had the pleasure of meeting Casey who made us very welcome.   We hope to return one day and would stay here again.",

Breakfast was cooked by the friendly girls in our villa and we were given a good choice of hot or cold breakfast as well as a big plate of seasonal fruit, tea and coffee. Water was in a 20 litre dispenser so we never ran out of water. The villas are situated 10 - 15 minutes walk or motor scooter ride from the markets, restaurants and monkey forest which was awesome. When we checked out we were given a late checkout at no cost to us as we had a 10 pm flight. We would definitely recommend Satori Villas to anyone who wants to experience the Balinese rice fields on your doorstep. We will definitely be going back.",

I have a personal issue with the geckos in and around the property.\nWhen i notified the management about my disappointment, the manager immediately came to visit me and was VERY WARM. He was very calm and patient with me and did everything in his power to make my family and me comfortable. Best hospitality i have received in Bali.\n\nThey are also trying to help me with a refund for my remaining two nights, which is very kind of them. \n\nI would surely recommend this place if you are ok with the walk and the geckos.The pool area is magical. The photographs on the website don't do justice to the place. The beauty is unreal.",

But i will never recommend it, i am checking out in one night instead of three nights.\nThe location is very inconvenient.There are only two scooters available for drop to the centre according to the staff, but in all reality only one scooter was there.\nThe staff is extremely courteous and very welcoming but it is not worth the effort.\nThe villa is beautiful so is the pool area by the day. But at night, it is scary. There are many lizards inside and outside the villa. I counted four inside the villa and four in the patio.\n\nIt may be common in bali, but i for one, feel very uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, the crockery provided in the villa was dirty and covered in ants.",

We are happy you say your \"villa is the most beautiful you have ever stayed in\" and that our \"service is extremely courteous and very welcoming\". These two comments are wonderful news to us. \n\nHowever lets make clear the following:\n\n1. Our location is very clear on our properties website. Had you or your travel agent taken a moment to look at it, you will see our location is in a green zone in central Ubud. If a 10 minute walk to the center fo Ubud, or a 3 minute motor scooter ride from the center of Ubud is far away...so be it, each to their own. For most, this would be considered close. No where on any of our sites does our location information depict we are right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Ubud center, where you wanted to be.\n2. Gekos are a part of tropical life, harmless and feed on mosquitos. If you want to enjoy a villa experience in Bali, 99% of the time you will encounter gekcos. Totally harmless and more afraid of you than you are of them. I have to say that geckos are a part of Bali and I doubt there is any where in Bali where you will not find them. Better gekos eating mosquitos than no gekos and being bitten by mosquitos.I have encountered gekos in many of the places I been in India, your home country, I was quite surprised your family was so frightened of them. \n\nAs we explained to you when we met, most important to us is that our guests have a wonderful experience in Bali. I am personally disappointed that the majority of your discomforts are something we could do nothing about, our location & gekos, yet you give only two stars. I find that rating very harsh, given we found a solution that was extremely satisfying and accommodating to your needs and desires. We will continue on our mission to be better today than we were yesterday. Warm regards to you and your lovely family, Wishing you safe travels and many wonderful memories of good times together in Bali.",

From the beautiful rice fields and delicious traditional Balinese breakfast, to Kasey and her heart-felt staff over-extending their hospitality, everything was truly magical. I went for a week by myself, and any doubts or fears I had traveling as a single woman was washed away once I was greeted by Satori Villas. The villa was spacious, clean, located in the heart of Ubud and walking distance to so many hidden gems. You're given a local phone to make calls during your stay, as well as call the staff for rides and any questions you may have during your stay. It was like I inherited a new family during my stay. I can't see myself returning to Bali and not staying at Satori Villas, they made my trip even more special :)",

              "text": "We stayed in Banana villa ( one of the villa of Satori villas). It's an awesome place. The villa had 3 rooms with attached toilets and bathroom and 1 room had toilet next to it. All the 3 rooms were spacious with view of swimming pool and rice fields. Only 1 room was relatively smaller with no great view. The kitchen is well stocked with food, cutlery and utensils if you plan to cook. Here are number of options we can select for breakfast and the cook and help were really fast in preparing and laying the breakfast. The villa is little inside and you have to walk for 10-15 mins to reach from Ubud central parking but it is amidst lovely rice fields and secluded from busy Ubud. You can't reach villa in a car or van. Only way to reach is by foot or bike. There is ample help from Satori villa to pick you up from Ubud central parking and also carry your bags. The location is great as you are just 15 mins away from the main Ubud market. We enjoyed staying in this place and will definitely come back again!!",

It is a 15 minute walk from the Villas to the heart of the action but it is a world away.  It was so nice to come back to the Villas after a day of exploration and luxuriate in the villas (we stayed in two different ones), especially those private swimming pools.  At night the frogs serenaded us to sleep.  Some days we just stayed there and enjoyed watching the rice farmers and the birds that frequent the paddies.  If you don\u2019t enjoy the walk like we did, the staff is always ready to give you a ride down the hill.  And the staff... very nice and helpful.  The driver, Gede, is helpful for day trips or airport runs.  We knew we would like Ubud, but didn\u2019t realize the lodging would be the highlight.",

Ademas el tiempo es mucho mas agradable que en la costa.\nEl pueblo de Ubub es una inmersion en la vida de los balineses y sus artesanos\nLas villas Satori son unas casas preciosas bien decoradas muy limpias y que tienen lo que tu puedas necesitar\nEs cierto que no se llega en coche a la puerta de la casa pero no lo necesitas, las personas a cargo de cuidar las villas estan dispuestas a llevarte en moto en cualquier momento y a cualquier hora, creerme que esta siendo para mi una gran experiencia.\nA cambio te duermes y amaneces con las vistas y los sonidos de los campos de arroz. Los sonidos por la noche son conciertos de la naturaleza que te acompa\u00f1an mientras descansas\nEstamos tomando masajes en la villa casi a diario y para ello nos pusieron dos mesas de masaje.\nTenemos servicio diario de desayuno con una carta muy variada a elegir cada dia ademas de zumos naturales, frutas variadas y todo lo que quieras pedir lo hacen realidad\nTambien hemos solicitado los servicios para que nos cocinaran en la villa de una seleccion de platos tipicos y la experiencia ha sido maravillosa. Las raciones tan abundantes que vamos a tener comida para varios dias.\nLas camas son muy comodas con sabanas de algodon muy suaves.\nLa limpieza diaria es un plus porque al llegar de las excursiones no tienes que ocuparte de nada mas que de descansar\nSi necesitas cambiar dinero, o quieres acercarte al pueblo para comprar, solo se lo comunicas por whappsap y en menos de dos minutos ya te responden\nCaminar desde la villa hasta Ubud es un camino entre casas del pueblo que te puede llevar 10 minutos\nEl personal de la villa esta siempre atento a cualquier necesidad 24 horas\nKetut, este hombre es una maquina a toda hora atiende su whappsap para cualquier necesidad o consulta y nada es un problema y si lo es, El tiene la solucion.\nNos perdieron dos maletas y llegaron a la villa en dias diferentes, Ketut se ocupo de todo e includo durante un tour nos envio una foto de la maleta ya en la villa, todo un detalle.\nWayan es un gran mujer, rapida, lista y con una sonrisa balinesa a todas horas. Ella y la ayuda de Vera, hacen que nuestra estancia aqui sea un sue\u00f1o , a mi me hace feliz verlas en la ma\u00f1ana ocupandose de la casa y los desayunos.\nSon dos hormiguitas que estan pendientes de todo y ni las oyes y casi no las ves. Son de una discrepcion total.\nCuidan la casa con muchisimos adornos, con flores naturales que adornan todos los rincones de la casa, las habitaciones y los ba\u00f1os.\nEn cada rincon hay un trabajo bien hecho y con mucho mimo y cari\u00f1o.\nHe estado anteriormente dos veces en Bali en hoteles de 5 estrellas y playa privada.\nEsta experiencia esta siendo la mejor en Bali y la repetire con mis nietos.\nMi recomendacion es contratar un guia con chofer 65 euros al dia y ya tu estancia es Bali sera completa.\nEn la villa tienen chofer y guia de habla inglesa, un hombre extraordinario que nos recogio en el aeropuerto.\nNosotros elegimos un guia de habla espa\u00f1ola porque yo no me entiendo muy bien en ingles, por si os puede interesar\n\nDewa Budiana\n+62 819 99255632\nGuia en Bali espa\u00f1ol e ingles \n\nGracias familia\nKetuk\nVera\nWayan\n\nMe llevo a los tres en el corazon y les doy la enhorabuena por ser tan especiales, cuidar de nosotros durante este tiempo con tanta cortesia y mimo.\nEn verdad son la hospitalidad, la amabilidad y la sonrisa de Bali en estado puro.\nLlevamos una semana aqui y todavia nos queda otra pero no he querido esperar a marcharme.\nSe me quedan muchos detalles en el tintero y solo puedo decir\nVen a Bali\nVen a Ubud\nAlojate en las villas Satori\nY habras entrado en el paraiso de tis vacaciones con un equipo humano que te cuidara y una villa con todas las comodidades.\nNo se puede pedir mas\nHasta siempre familia Balinesa",

              "text": "Die Bilder auf Booking.com (dort haben wir gebucht) spiegeln leider nicht das wieder wie wir unsere Villa vorgefunden haben. Das war etwas entt\u00e4uschend und daher hat es meine Erwartungen nicht erf\u00fcllt.\n\nDie Kulisse und Umgebung ist sehr sch\u00f6n und vor allem voller Ruhe!\n\nDas Personal war durchweg freundlich und professionell.\n\nDie Lage ist sehr abgelegen und man kommt nur per etwas l\u00e4ngerem Fu\u00dfweg oder per Roller zu der Unterkunft. Man bekommt ein Handy zu Verf\u00fcgung gestellt, wo man anrufen kann um dann vom Personal mit dem Roller gefahren zu werden. Der Service ist super - allerdings ist man wenn man keinen eigenen Roller hat immer auf diesen Service angewiesen.\n\nDie Bettw\u00e4sche war leider nicht sehr sauber (hatte einige Flecken).\n\nIm Vorfeld hatten wir einen Late Check Out angefragt (konnte uns noch nicht zugesagt werden wegen der unklaren Buchungslage an dem Tag). Bei Anreise teilte man uns mit, dass dies nicht m\u00f6glich sei - v\u00f6llig okay f\u00fcr uns. Etwas entt\u00e4uschend fand ich an der Angelegenheit, dass es keine andere M\u00f6glichkeit gab eine Dusche zu nehmen vor dem R\u00fcckflug (mehr wollten wir nicht). Hier war man leider nicht bem\u00fcht eine L\u00f6sung anzubieten oder zu finden. \n",
