Putu is a really great guide who works at the National Park.  He is really passionate and familiar with the park from Mangrove to all the species.  On top of that, the hotel contributes to the park conservation.\n\nTh hotel has a nice breeze every day.  Although it was a dry season, we did not feel hot at all.  \n\nThe manager, Yes, is always there to check on you, making sure you are always comfortable.  He even went beyond and requested the kitchen to make us some local food that are not in the menu.\n\nHighly recommended to stay at this hotel!\n",

He arranged for a day excursion to Menjangan Island for snorkeling.  He personally drove us to the Proyak Penyu turtle hatchery project, introduced us to founder Chris Brown and went on a short tour with us.  The on-stite massage therapists were excellent.  The 2 swimming pools are fantastic, mostly salt water w/ a small amount of chlorine.  Excellent meals.  Beautiful rooms. Highly recommended.\n\nThe hotel does not have any beach front, but it is a simple request to be driven to a nearby beach.",

We would like to thank Tony, Carole and their wonderful staff once again for their kindness, attentiveness and sincere hospitality. We really felt cared for and we will be forever greatful for this. They have built a one-of-a-kind resort with such attention to detail and respect for its surroundings that it truly represents the definition of perfection. One of things we loved most is that the entire experience was pure, essential, nothing superfluous, from the environment to the decor and the people, just like the meaning of the word \"sari\". All this is a reflection of both of them, two very special people. \nWe hope to be back again soon! ",

The area is all villages so there is not much around, but we were lucky enough to spot a trip advisor sign of Santi Sari. We followed the dirt tracks all the way to the Hotel, where we were blown away by the beauty of the gardens and facilities. After we had been shown around the hotel, we were treated to a complimentary drink and met the host Carol. She made us feel really welcome and after a short conversation we were invited to stay in one of the gorgeous suites, it was both romantic and comfortable. The food was delicious and we had the best Chakra aligning massages of all time. Highly recommended. Will be back again! Thanks so much to Carol and her family our new friends!

The snorkeling (with own boat) is an absolute GO! Also, our hikes with \"Tattoo\" were very interesting. The food (breakfast, lunch and diner) are well-priced and tasty. We like to eat relaxed, so tell the staff so they will not bring the course too quick following each other. Also, good wine-list, not too expensive. If we return to Bali, it will be here.\nThe really only minus: the mosque starting at 5am...",

The grounds and gardens are very attractive and the restaurant is set by the pool with wonderful sea views.  There is an extensive menu offering a huge selection of styles of food from Indonesian to Turkish to Chinese etc.  I had the gazpacho and an Indonesian spicy chicken dish.  Both were very tasty, beautifully presented and properly served.  The meals (and the rooms) are not inexpensive, but highly recommended for a special occasion",

I didn't know what was at the end of it but I just needed to come here which is so bizarre. At the end of the road there ends up being this Oasis which is Santi Sari and I thought: okay I'll just have a drink here, get out of the rain and get my bearings. I end up meeting the owner Tony and as its low season get alot of facetime with him. We end up having an amazing metaphysical conversation at which time I decide to stay the night in the best suite here. We then had dinner and chatted until 3 o'clock in the morning! As a side bar I had lost my car keys and couldn't get any of my luggage out of the car so the entire staff searched high and low with flashlights to try and find them to no avail. Tony even lent me a shirt and bathing trunks to tide me over! The following morning after hours of fruitless searching a gardener found the keys at the bottom of the lotus pond! This saved me days if not weeks of pain with the rental agents.\n\nThankfully none of that detracted from a very transformative stay. The location, the staff, the food, the design qualities and style and in particular Tony were all top notch. Make the effort to stay here. ",

The friendly staff and owner's personalised, yet unintrusive attention to detail and service made our stay extra special. The accommodation and decor are understatedly elegant. The relaxation areas, gardens, pools, and day beds allow for a truly tranquil experience. The meals are delicious and ample, I also love the afternoon tea experience. This area is also an authentic experience of Bali, with world class snorkelling and diving at the nearby pristine marine park Menjangen Island - a must do excursion with the resorts own boat tour and national parks. A stay at Santi Sari is truly as the meaning of its name - 'Essence of Peace'.",

              "text": "Santi Sari is located within a short boat ride to the spectacular coral reefs off the Bali national park.  The owners were warm and friendly folks who genuinely cared for us and ensured we had a great visit.  The property is wonderfully laid out and private.  Our pool was secluded and filled with soothing un-chlorinated salt water.  Skipping the tourist boats that shuttle visitors to the Menjangan Island coral reefs,  Santi Sari provided us their covered boat with driver and guide who personally dove with us to make sure we saw all the beauty the island reefs display.  Getting to the resort was easy as they arranged a driver at a nominal fee who met us at the airport and drove us directly to the property.  The dining at the resort was exceptional with fresh-caught fish and an array of local Balinese dishes.  We were impressed with the breadth of the menu.  The beach at nearby Pemuteran was a quick hop away with resort's shuttle service.  It has some nice coral (some uniquely man-made) and a sea turtle rescue operation you can see first hand. We had a really enjoyable stay at Sani Sari.",

              "text": "The Santi Sari is a truly magical place, Its a remote location with beautiful views of the ocean and mangroves. Me and my boyfriend were looking for a unique place that could completely relax and cleanse us from our daily stresses, the santi sari gave us that and so much more! Tony who owns the hotel, is a very special person and he went out of his way to make our stay as relaxing and amazing as we had hoped it would be. Even taking us to a special hindu ceremony in an incredible temple that i personally wanted to find but probably wouldn't have if he hadn't shown me. We went half board and it catered to all of our needs the food was wonderful and we even tried the traditional balinese dinner that we both enjoyed very much. The staff were extremely nice, very professional and always there if you needed anything. There are a great range of excursions you can book, we would recommend the snorkelling trip to menjangan island they have a private boat to take you across the journey is lovely with the local fishermen and women waving and smiling as you go past, lunch is also provided and the views are stunning with an incredible amount of fish and living coral. Tony also provides a fantastic tour guide who took us to java to climb Kawah Ijen volcano he was a great guy very entertaining and showed us a lot of things including the coffee plantations and stopping in the jungle on the drive so we could take photographs of a black monkey, and also taking me to buy some java coffee for a great price as i love coffee which was a nice thing, we would recommend both trips. On the whole santi sari is one of the most amazing places i have stayed and we would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a relaxing getaway & prefers something unique to a typical luxury resort. We will definitely be going back.",

Situated close to the West Bali National Park and about 20 minutes from Lovina on the road to Gilimanuk, Santi Sari ticks all the boxes for the true Bali getaway. From the luxuriously appointed villas to the family style dining area every detail has been considered in the context of authentic Bali. \nSanti Sari fits into its surroundings beautifully and even has a its own Balinese temple where the staff and locals carry out ceremonies on auspicious days, and as anyone who has been to Bali knows, there are a goodly number of those throughout the year. There are snorkelling and trekking adventures to be had if that's your schtick or one can just laze about, soaking up the serenity. \nThis hotel is perfect for a romantic interlude, a honeymoon, for experienced travellers to Indonesia who seek out of the way destinations and for families with an adventurous spirit (who have moved on from the need for a \"Kid's Klub\").",

              "text": "This hotel feels like it is at the end of the road in the middle of nowhere, which is amazing or limiting, depending on your mindset. The hotel is about 3.5 hours from Ubud if you don\u2019t stop and depending on traffic. While it shows up as being in Pumuteran on many websites, it is actually about ten miles past the town. Once you get there, you will not be leaving much unless you have a car, so plan on a kind of \u201call inclusive\u201d experience and just give in. Tony, the host, will take you on an outstanding personal boat trip to snorkel the remarkable reef (you will not be rushed or expected to swim back to the boat; the boat comes to you, and you will go to multiple spots to find the best sea life and conditions for the day), someone will cut you a green coconut out of a tree as you watch, for your afternoon refreshment when you return, the staff will give a massage in the beautiful sitting room upstairs as the breeze blows through and you listen to evening prayers from the local mosque, and you will get great advice on where to go and what to do if you are an intrepid traveller who doesn\u2019t have it all planned out in advance. Tony has been traveling the area for years and knows what is not to be missed and what is just a tourist trap. He is an all-around great conversationalist with an interesting story. He offers many kinds of adventures and excursions that I am sure are fabulous.\n\nI stayed for three nights as a solo traveller. There was another american family staying there for my first two nights, and I tagged along on the snorkeling trip that they booked (a minimum of two is needed to make a trip, so I got lucky). On my last day and night, I was the only guest and I took full advantage of the property, swimming in the two pools, lounging about and walking the dock. It was my first traveling day to do \u201cnothing\u201d and Santi Sari is the perfect spot for that. It is a healing place. My biggest critique is of the food. Admittedly, I am a very health-conscious eater and vegetarian and I don't like oily or fried food. Many of the veggie options were fried or had sauce and dressing that was both bland and too heavy or oily for me. I needed salt, pepper, lime juice and sambal to be content. Breakfast was fabulous and could be made however you prefer, which I figured out after a day or two. The fruit with yogurt and honey had to be my favorite, with tiny strawberries from the local mountains and fresh mint.\n\nThe rooms here are absolutely gorgeous, with elegant furniture, private sitting areas outside, spacious and gorgeous bathrooms, and many sweet spots on the property for you to hide away and relax. Your every need will be met, with a prices attached that are more American than Balinese, but a hotel like this in the U.S. would be hard to find and would still be at least three times the price for the degree of service and personal attention. I would go back in a heartbeat with a better understanding of what was in store. This property is extremely private and safe and would be an idyllic hotel for honeymooners. It is a very romantic and magical spot away from the crowds of the south. Don\u2019t hesitate to stay here.",

You need a boat and a guide to get there. The guide from the hotel was great. .\n\nThe food was good. The restaurant has a beautiful view on the ocean. There are a lot of vegeterian options which is great. Wifi is only available in the restaurant, but fine for me.\n\nRoom is big and also have a beatiful view on the ocean. Pools are great for cooling down.\n\nWith thanks to the lovely staff!",

              "text": "My husband and I have traveled extensively and stayed at many beautiful hotels, but I must say, this is one of my favorites. There is a bit of magic here- a truly special place. The view from our room made me never want to leave! The owners Tony and Carol, make you feel as if you are long lost friends. The food was some of the best we had on this trip (fresh fish off the boat everyday and fresh coconuts we watched the workers cut off the trees). It was a welcomed change to have a range of gourmet food to choose from after days of Balinese food. The staff is wonderfully trained and helpful- do not miss the massages! They were some of the best in Bali! There are only 10 rooms and we barely saw the 2 other couples that were there so we really felt like we had privacy in this idyllic setting. Tony invited us to their onsite temple to experience the full moon ceremony and it was fascinating to have this peak into the Hindu culture.  The snorkeling in amazing- I had read that this was the best place to snorkel on the island and I was not let down. The private boat and guide really make it a fantastic experience. I can't say enough good things about Santi Sari- just get there  as soon as you can! I can't wait to go back!!",

              "text": "Santi Sari is an idyllic location and I would highly recommend the hotel to anyway who is travelling to Bali. We stayed for 2 weeks and enjoyed every minute. The hotel, built from scratch on a plot of land is beautiful and there is so much attention to detail - from the hand carved doors all made from local Balinese wood, to the luxurious 4 poster beds! Expect 5 star quality food with a range of local fish on the menu (I would recommend the Mahi Mahi) as well as a huge selection of other cuisines to suit all tastes. There is also a good range of Indonesian classics if you want to try the local food too. \n\nWe felt at home the second we arrived, greeted by the lovely Yas at reception as well as Tony the owner who showed us to our suite (one of the Banyan rooms). After a long trip from the UK it was almost like we were dreaming when we saw the room.\n\nIn terms of things to do there are lots of activities that can be organised by the hotel. We were taken on a trip to Menjangan Island with Tony and the boat drive Nana who is also an experience snorkeler. Snorkelling around the coral reefs there was incredible and there are many fish to see as well as beautiful coloured coral. The hotel organised a lovely packed lunch for us and brought plenty of water and towels for our comfort.\n\nTony also took as to see the local temples in the area (the village of Permuteran) which were very special and we managed to witness a Sunday ceremony. Tony is extremely insightful and knowledgeable about Balinese culture and the Hindu religion so we felt like we learnt many things while we were there.\n\nOverall I would highly recommend Santi Sari, even if just for one night or a 2 week break like us it is perfect for anyone looking to relax and be looked after very well. \n\nThank you Tony and Carole we will be back soon!",

And what a stay it was... The hotel itself is made to almost perfection, with high quality standards, the staff is impeccable and 24/7 ready to make your day, the kitchen serves great dishes from almost all continents and the peace and quiet was addicting. We had the opportunity to spend time with the owner, making our stay even better. No request was too much and no effort spared to make us feel at home. This planned two nights stay turned into a 6 night stay, where me and my girlfriend feel that this hidden treasure was meant to cross our paths and we enjoyed it very, very much.",

The staff blessed my friend George and I on our arrival, and I immediately knew this was going to be fabulous.\n\nmy room had a marble  shower bigger than my bathroom at home....ha ha..true!!\nand just wait untill you see the four poster carved bed and the amazing soft flowing drapery-mosquito net around it...when I awoke I felt like I was in a cloud, and the peace and serenity was indescribable.\n\nI spent hours in the salt water pool, surrounded by magificant statues and lush green gardens, and attentive staff, who whilst still giving privacy were on hand to attend to any request with a big beautiful smile.\n\nThe food was wonderful, the menu show casing dishes from all corners of the world.\n\nThis hotel is a credit to it's founders Carol and Tony Anisworth, I'll be back!",

The pools are divine, with the gentle sounds of the water features and birds ensuring you are somewhere very special. Snorkeling is a must... the best i have ever seen...i found nemo! it really is one of the best locations to snorkel/dive in the world - no exageration. i fondly remember exhaling after getting back on the boat thinking 'i have just had one of the best experiences of my life'..regardless of the sunburn :) \nfood is exceptional, home made bread. Eating dinner whilst watching the swallors dip and dive in the water and then the transition from swollow to little cute bats.\nI am very greatful for the experience and to meet Carol and Tony the welcoming owners.\nI will be back again and again xxx lots of love and gratitude Bernita Edwards - Australia.",

              "text": "Just called in here for lunch last week and were treated royally by Carol & Tony. The menu was Mediterranean/fusion. We were given 3 different spreads for our bread, which is just a small sign of the attention to detail. Must confess we had a pizza, which is often a disaster in another culture.  Not here. Thin and crispy, quality toppings. \nThe hotel is just 1 year old this week. It looks sensational, with 10 suites in fabulous grounds & a private jetty & boat to take you to nearby islands. We already had accommodation elsewhere, but will certainly check it out next time. Not the place if you want a lot of nearby action, but just the place for a quality escape.",

              "text": "Learning back home via trip advisor about the Santi Sari we were looking forward to our stay in April 2011. Travelling first from South to the centre of Bali and then to the North, arriving late at night we were stunned by the beautiful (we would call it zen) architecture and surroundings by the Santi Sari hotel. By daylight the next morning looking around at architecture and garden you can see that beliefs and extraordinary good taste and attention to details are carried through hotel and garden. It is fascinating and refreshing. Walking to the jetty, taking a boat ride to Menjangan island, discovering the underwater world snorkeling was definetely a beautiful experience, going scuba diving was arranged close by, some beautiful smaller temples including cheeky but fun macaques to experience are around, swimming in the pool and being pampered at the restaurant or at the spa by the Santi Sari team completed a perfect stay for almost a week. On top it\u2019s been very interesting, nice and a special experience to meet the owner of the hotel Tony whom we are very thankful for some good advices. If you want to spend some special time go there!",

So glad we did!\nWe came through the front gates to find a wide open green space with an incredible view of the ocean, and were greeted by the most welcoming staff team I've ever met!\nWe felt spoilt as soon as we walked through the gate. \nThe rooms were at the top of the hill which overlooked the bay and menjangan island, and the rooms were so private that we felt like we had the whole place to ourself, and a pool of out very own. We didn't- we were nearby to another couple who were in exactly the same headspace as us - this resort isn't 'high density' accommodation, its spacious, peaceful and incredibly beautiful.\nThe staff and owners were the most welcoming, generous and hospitable people, and just made out stay so memorable. We joined them in a trip to the island and went snorkeling and ate lunch with them, and were accompanied on our trip back in the boat by a pod of dolphins and then the most beautiful lightning storm... Amazing, and sharing it with people who also appreciated it as much as we did made it twice as memorable!\nThis hotel has everything you could ask for if you want to relax and appreciate your surrounds and the peacefulness of Bali-\n- amazing food\n- beautiful staff\n- luxury rooms and outdoor pool areas\n- plenty of guided activities to do\n- plenty of places to relax and take in the view.\nWe'll definitely be back!",

The owners, Tony and Carol have created a healing space of balance and delight. The energy of the hotel feels peaceful; the service is attentive and delightful, and the owners - one of whom is always there - wonderful people to get to know. One of the many highlights is their own boat, leaving daily from a private jetty, taking folks to the incredible coral reefs of Menjangan. The dive master, Nana could not have been more kind and attentive; as inexperienced snorkelers, we felt safe and protected. On a beautiful day we saw dolphins playing in the water, snorkeled over amazing coral and fish, ate a delicious picnic lunch, visited the island temple and saw wild deer up close. It was truly a perfect  and magical stay.  We will be back. Look them up on the web at santisarihotel.com. You'll be glad you did.",

The service was friendly, polite, warm and responsive. The owners have a presence there so they leave no detail up to chance. We spent a day snorkeling on one of the hotel boats and had a great time. The food was incredibly good not just cooking local specialities but alo had an international capability. The spigetti was as good as the best italian pasta in italy. The greek specialities of the chef were also wonderful.  I can not think of a thing to criticize.",

We happened upon Santi Sari on a stay in the north, had an excellent gourmet dinner and decided to return the following week for my husbands birthday.  We were delighted with the incredible attention to detail, relaxed atmosphere and luxurious accommodations.  We always look for the authentic experience by engaging with the Balinese staff (all locals with excellent English skills and the playful sense of humor we've come to love).  They could not have done more for us.  We spent some wonderful time with Tony and have to say we arrived as guests and left as friends.  Will look forward to many fun stays when Menjangan calls!",

You can really sense the amount of details and thoughts that went into each villa and the landscape.  I woke up everyday with a smile and found myself just happy to be so relaxed and able to enjoy such a wonderful place.  Carol, the owner and her staff were extremely friendly and helpful. They were the icing on the cake!  Bravo:)",

It is as private as you want it to be designed with great chill out areas and separate infinity pools and restaurants.\n\nThe staff are very friendly and the food is exceptional, there are some excellent day activities we went on the private boat and snorkled around Menjangan island, great to see some amazing fish and coral that has been untouched...\n\nIf you go to Bali Santa Sari is a must do, it would suit singles, couples and would be perfect for a group of friends...\n\nMy thanks to Tony for helping out a sick traveler, this really is a healing place recommended to all, staying there really was a memorable part of my holiday :)",

So we booked to stay for 3 nights, but after 2 nights decided to stay till our flight. Ten days of bliss. I had no idea, there was so many levels of relaxation.\n\nWe went on Santi Sari's snorkelling tour twice. Could have gone everyday, and on hindsight wish we had gone a couple more times. \n\nQuite honestly we would probably have left Bali early if was not for Santi Sari. I just cannot recommend them highly enough. And would agree with everything said by the previous reviewer. \n\nThere is wifi in the restaurant area, not in the rooms...but why would you want to remain in the rooms even if they were divine, when salt water pools and gardens are heaven itself. Don't hesitate! Experience Santi Sari yourself!",

              "text": "A lovely boutique hotel. Very warm welcome by the owner Tony who was very helpful throughout the whole stay.\n\nWe were there 3 nights and took 2 day-trips to Menjangan islands for snorkeling. It was a wonderful experience. You need a boat and a guide to get there. Nana, the guide from the hotel, was great. Highly recommended to take that trip.\n\nFood was of good quality, some dishes like pasta and desserts excellent. The pizza was a bit sweet and reminded me of pizzas in UK, not Italy ;-) Anyhow, we were happy to get also European food as we ate just local Indonesian food the weeks before. There are a lot of vegeterian options which is great.\n\nThe only negative point we have is not really a big issue: the indonesian staff was very friendly but seemed partly over professional. For example ordering an espresso instead of Bali coffee at breakfast shouldn't be a big thing and of course also not charged extra. But due to their professionalism they did not really know how to solve that and finally refused. Well, again, not due to unwillingness - more due to beeing trained very straight. The warmths and true hospitality we felt from Tony was not coming from the staff.\n\nWe had several such smaller issues where we had the same feeling. Anyhow, the overall experience was great and we would stay here again definitly.\n\nMassage was good and affordable.\n\nWifi works well in the restaurant area and that is completely fine. For north Bali that is a high standard - we stayed in other areas where we had way more troubles to connect.\n\nYou get used to the prayers of the Mosques. As Bali is an Indonesian island it just is, how it is. A/C was the best we had on our trip, in quite mode still powerful enough to cool our room. We had the smallest room I guess and can of course just talk for our room.\n\nIt is a remote, peaceful and quite place. Highly recommended if you plan snorekling in Menjangan islands.",

We succeeded in our goals to do nothing at all and did not leave the boutique resort safe for a snorkeling trip at the colourful reef.  The staff is super firendly and engaging, the food wonderful - try the fresh sambal matah with each dish - and the remaining stock of Storm beer goes very well with the food - or with peanuts during late afternoon lounging at the salt water pools. \nThe rooms were clean and well designed and thought through, probably the result of the couples extensive traveling in the past :) \n\nOne of the highlights was a birthday celebration at the balcony of the massage floor surrounded by flowers and candlelights which came as a total surprise: Tony and Carol offered a glass of champaign, the staff lit sparkler fireworks, the birthday cake was presented by the staff and shared, and on return in the bungalow a beautiful flower arrangement with frangipani flowes and little organge flowers painstakingly pinned to a well wishes card was on the four poster bed. An unforgettable experience. \n\nDefinitely a place recommending for a few days romantic getwaway!\n",

Very surprising : had complete scampi (with carapace !) pan fried. When enquired, was told its always like this and word should be given to the cook to change habit (after 5 years of existence ??).\n\nCons :\n- bungalows in a beautiful garden but too close to each other : need to keep some curtain close all the time for privacy. And that is really a pity as there is enough land to provide more space and better independence feeling.\n\n-airco : too weak\n\n- no internet in the room, reason given for health (dont understand why option not given and simply switch off if not needed, like in the main restaurant building)\n\n-rooms : nice big beds but.. due ramadan and Mosque nearby, was woken up every morning around 4am, despite earplugs provided.\n\nConclusion : its overall a nice place, which gives feeling of being away from the crowd. But when charged these kind of price for north Bali, you expect a bit more \"professionalism\", not to say more \"value for money\".",

              "text": "'Santi Sari' translates to english as 'essence of peace' the owners Tony and Carole explained to us during our stay- and it's easy to see why. In a similar vain to all other reviews on here, I must celebrate the attention to detail in all areas of this magnificent boutique hotel. The super friendly and attentive staff are always at hand to fulfill your requests, whether it be to pick something up from the shop for you or even to give you a full body massage (with a choice of delicious smelling oils). Due to the welcoming and attentive nature of the staff it was incredibly easy to feel at peace and calm in the beautiful settings of the hotel. Home stresses and worries seemed to dissappear as soon as we arrived and set us up for the ultimate fortnight of relaxation, fantastic sea food and cultural activites. Tony arranged a driver for us to visit Ubud, Deer island for snorkling and several local temples in Permuteran. \n\nWe experienced luxurious comfort in the Banyan suit and bathed mainly by the smaller pool- and due to the small number of rooms it is possible to recieve the upmost privacy at all times. It was also lovely to sit down for dinner with Tony and Carole and the other guests for dinner each night and hear stories and the history of the island. They are extremely knowledgable and enthusiastic about the vibrant culture in Bali.\n\ni couldn't reccomend this hotel more. It is idyllic, tranquil, colourful and time seems to drift by with a sense of calm. \n\nAwesome for couples but equally as accomodating for groups travelling around the island or lone travellers looking for a rest-stop. whoever you are and wherever you're from, one things is certain, that Tony and Carole will be the most welcoming hosts you have ever met, and you wil leave santi sari feeling cleansed and calm :)\n\nThanks Tony and Carol for a wonderful stay",

I can only endorse the other positive comments, and remind the owners Carole and Tony that I will be back on my next stay to Bali to take full advantage of their wonderful hospitality.",

              "text": "Lots of  positive things have already  been said about Santi Sari in previous reviews. We can fully endorse them all.  Santi Sari really is a very special and spiritual place, unequalled in our years of travelling around the world. From the moment we arrived everything was done by the lovely owners and all the staff to make our 2 week stay a wonderful experience.  \n\nThe hotel is set in extensive peaceful grounds, beautifully planted, which extend to the mangrove fringed private bay. From the hotel's jetty  there are stunning views of the volcanoes on nearby Java,  and is the best place to catch sunrise and sunset.  It is located in a part of Bali that has minimal impact from tourism - a world away from the Southern part of the island. \n\nWe were absolutely delighted with our suite, Banyan 4, but  would have been equally happy with any of the other suites, small or large.  All are spacious, beautifully furnished with high quality furniture and furnishings. The housekeeping is exemplary and the locally produced toiletries are luxurious. The air con is the best we've ever had. \n\nThe menu is extensive and varied, with plenty of vegetarian options. The food is absolutely delicious, beautifully presented, in generous portions.  The local fish dishes are a must! As are the homemade ice creams and sorbets.  \n\nThe programme of excursions offered, with local drivers and guides, is imaginative and provides a real experience of Bali. The trips to Ijen volcano on Java, UNESCO rice fields at Jatiluwih,   and snorkelling at Menjangan island shouldn't be missed. Neither should the relaxing spa treatments. \n\nWhat really sets this place apart from others is the total sense of peace and tranquility, and it is a truly spiritual place that is very hard to leave.   \n\nJust go there and experience it yourselves.",

Your hosts are superb, the staff friendly and attentive, the food very good. Would like to point out we are seasoned travellers of the Maldive but one would have to snorkel/Dive here as it is superb.\nThis place is a must for anyone thinking of travelling to Bali.",

We had the resort almost entirely to ourselves which added to the feeling of total seclusion in North-western Bali, except for the calls for prayer in the morning which can be considered a bit annoying. In particular the ones that do not seem to come from actual mosques, but from neighboring houses. \nNonetheless it has been a great experience: The food was fantastic, so was our experience with day-trips and the spa. In particular snorkeling around the Island Menganjan (Deer Island, where we saw 5 of the deer that give the Island is name during a short walk). Also the nature walk was a nice experience. Thank you, Santi Sari. \nOverall we consider this a must-go location in North-western Bali.",

              "text": "Stayed here with a group of friends and loved it. It's a 4 hour drive from Denpasar, but the drive itself is stunning (and you can make stops along the way if you arrange it), and when we arrived at Santi Sari, it felt like we'd been dropped in paradise. The owners go out of their way to make you feel at home, and even took us around the area to see some of the temples and nearby turtle sanctuary. You could easily just hang out at the hotel and relax - breakfast and the restaurant are excellent, and the infinity pool is stunning - we couldn't stop taking photos. The rooms are beautiful and large, with mosquito netting over the beds (bring good repellent, though they also have some there) and a gorgeous outdoor shower in the garden. \n\nWe did two additional excursions - renting a boat for the morning to go snorkelling at Pulau Menjangan (the owners recommended snorkeling so that we could be all together rather than diving, as some of us weren't certified, but if I were to go back, I'd definitely want to dive as well - the water and diversity of fish and coral is just incredible) - definitely the nicest place I've snorkelled. We also did the 1-day excursion to the neighbouring island of Java to hike up Kiawah Ijen volcano, see coffee plantations, visit a stunning waterfall, etc. - highly recommended, though you should be in decent shape for the hike. The volcano features a crater lake with the most incredible colours, and we agreed it was probably the highlight of our trip to Bali (despite being on Java).\n\nThe only slight unpleasantness came when we wanted to pay - we'd requested the bill in advance so that we could divide it up, but we didn't receive it until our car to take us back to Seminyak had arrived. Only at this time did we learn that payment by credit card would tack on an additional fee, and if we didn't have local currency, the exchange rate used was unfavourable (despite prices being quoted to me in USD when I emailed to make the reservation). We hadn't expected this and at no point were we told that despite the reservation quote being in USD, we would have to pay in local currency. This definitely wouldn't prevent me from recommending Santi Sari and staying here again, but it's something to keep in mind.",

              "text": "Last November we had a wonderful stay in the Santi Sari Boutique Hotel. From day 1 ( the moment we stepped into the reception) to the last day all was perfect. Excellent hotel room/cabin. We had the one with an outside bath which we really used and enjoyed. Breakfast was a choice from the menu. We skipped lunch but were welcomed everyday with an afternoon tea with sandwiches. Dinner from the local cook was also excellent and more than enough for every apetite. There is a small wine list, but i am not a great fan of the local produced wines, but still a glass of wine to even more enjoy the evening on the terraces of Santi Sari was the reason for me to choose the wine they offered. Bedrooms and Beds are excellent, but because of a large muslim population in the nearby town, there is a call for morning prayer at 04.15 hrs which could wake you up. So when you are a light sleeper use the earplugs supplied by Santi Sari or bring your own. 2 Swimming pools are available, many of the rooms have outside beds. A large garden and a very nice view from the terraces, garden and 1st floor in the main building make it even more desirable place to stay. Staff is excellent and i can recommend the body massages and daytrips. If ever we will revisit Bali we will make sure that the Santi Sari will be on the list of our stops on this beautiful island with its friendly people. We can truly recommend the Santi Sari when you visit the region of Permuteran.",

              "text": "Santi Sari is off the beaten path and somewhat of an enclave in the northwest corner of Bali, near the national park.  The property and rooms are lovely as already described by others. Owners are attentive and genuinely want your stay with them to be perfect; they are proud of the place and have worked hard to create an appealing, high-end destination with all the amenities. The staff is well-trained and warm. Half-board or full-board option covers all meals while you're there; other restaurant options really don't exist nearby.  \n\nYou will get a taste of Hindu/Balinese life if you are lucky enough to be there for a ceremony, make it a point to ask questions of the owners and staff, and/or are adventurous enough to walk into the village where you will probably turn some heads, as tourists are relatively rare in this area. \n\nRoads are slow in Bali and I wouldn't recommend using Santi Sari as a home base; instead, enjoy it for what it is: top notch snorkeling easily accessed with Santi Sari's boat and Nama as a guide; lovely pool; terraces to read and relax; terrific massage; and staff near at hand. What's not to like? We didn't venture off the property other than to snorkel, and probably should have, because I ended up feeling rather isolated and was glad to be going to Ubud for a few days. (As this was our first and probably only trip to Bali, we used Santi Sari for relaxation and rest, then enjoyed four nights in Ubud. While Ubud is criticized for being touristy, it offers Balinese crafts, traditional dancing, and a look at the rice paddies. A day trip into Ubud from Santi Sari would take six hours driving round-trip, and you would be there when it is loaded with other busloads of tourists from all over the island. There is much to enjoy in Ubud but not during those mid-day hours. For hotel recommendation there, see my other reviews.)",

The suite we had been allocated was beautiful with locally made furniture, a huge four poster bed and and a bathroom to die for. The bath was a volcanic boulder cut in half with the inside scooped and smoothed out with enough room for even a party in the bath.\n\nFood was beautifully presented, delicious and fresh using local produce and localy caught fish.\nWine was well represented from all continents.\n\nThe staff were just simply brilliant always with huge smiles and willing. Could not have been better.\n\nWe were invited by the owner to the temple he had built for the staff to take part in a service celebrating the new moon. We were made to feel very comfortable and part of the whole proceedings. Another great experience.\n\nIf you go, you must try the snorkling on the reef off deer island. It is simply outstanding, the fish, the colours and of course the coral. This was then followed by lunch on the beach. Make sure Nana goes with you. He looks after the hotel's boat and he will ensure your absolute safety. Great guy.\n\nThen there is the rain forrest trek. Just go and learn what nature does. We learned so much about the trees from the owner. And you are surrounded by monkeys who are so playful.   \n\nWould we go again? Back next year, just working through some dates. It was chillin'.",

              "text": "Going back to a place which was simply said more than perfect the first time is always tricky.\n\nTricky in the sense that the perfection, the sensation and magic of the place experienced during the first visit is always hard to surpass and a second visit can only end up being lower on the scale than the first encounter, especially if it was so very special back then. \nGoing in against that feeling we went anyways back to Santi Sari, and how good that decision turned out to be! \nAgain we came in the low season, meaning that is was very quiet, only one or two other guests, the staff relaxed and the weather still perfect.\nGoing to Santi Sari means: Tranquility, Spirituality, Rest, Relax, very good food, perfect service and amazing rooms. The combination of this all brings makes the difference to other comparable hotels, 1+1=3 applies here.\nOur visit was again perfect and we enjoyed it so much. For us, it remains a special place and we hope to come back one day, hopefully with family or friends to share it with.\nThe boutique hotel has a 'feel' which is hard to find and to equal, but hard to make tangible in words. My advise would be to just go and experience.\nAs a last comment i would like to especially thank the whole Santi Sari team for making our visit unforgettable. You make the difference.\nThanks Carole and Tony for having us again, the fruit of your hard labor is evident. We will see each other again.",

And the final rough dirt road to Santi Sari leaded my sense of wonderful land would be there ..!!!! Wow!!!!!!\nVery very nice and beautful spot,excellent bedding and room,food was very good with very good service and nice personels. And spa was excellent and it is a same or even better level than as in Maya Hotel ( top one spa in Ubud ). We have a half day for snorkeling with a good and experienced guy and a boat with driver exclusively. \nAlso have had a walk in National Park along the beach with a interesting guide.\nHave days in swimming pool and sun bathing in the morning share with lovely garden and surroundings.You can feel the real peace both in body and mind.\nThey have a small shop and collections for collectables with the owners view. Good designs and trends of Bali with top quality and perfectly reasonable prices. The pearls and conch shells displayed look like some luxury ones.\nThings happen in Santi Sari these days was amazing+fantastic,.....far beyong my words.\nPeople go to santi sari are prayed for peace and good!!!!! Carole,thank you!!!",

              "text": "This is by far the loveliest place I have ever stayed. I came here with my boyfriend, my mum and dad for five nights. Hidden away down a dirt track you would never guess that this place existed! We arrived at night after a long car journey and were made to feel very relaxed and welcome immediately.\n\nThe owners, Tony and Carole were both around for the whole time we were there and they did everything they could to make sure we were happy. They really went out of their way - as did the rest of the staff - to make the experience amazing.\n\nThe grounds are absolutely stunning and are immaculately kept. There are two pools although we just used one and mostly had it to ourselves for the whole trip (a stroke of luck since it's a busy place).  Lots of comfortable sunloungers and plenty of clean beach towels laid out so you could help yourself. They have literally thought of your every possible need! \n\nThe rooms are faultless; beautifully decorated, spacious and immaculate. The bathroom is huge with a great shower. Lovely toiletries provided and we had aloe vera plants outside to use when sunburned! \n\nWe ate three meals a day in the restaurant for the five days we were there and the food was always absolutely delicious. The chocolate mousse was one of my favourites! The restaurant staff were also incredibly accommodating and so friendly - they could not do enough to please you.\n\nThere is a good choice of activities to do if you fancy a break from sunbathing. I had an oil massage in a beautiful spacious room with an astonishing view which was amazing! We also went snorkeling for the day, something I would highly recommend. The man who took us on the trip was so friendly, helpful and kind. My mum was really nervous about getting in the water and he stayed by her side the whole time just so she could experience snorkeling. He brought everything we could have possible needed or wanted and more - we just had to turn up. \n\nThe whole place is just so peaceful and relaxing - it was difficult adjusting to the other accommodation booked for the rest of our trip since Santi Sari set the standard so high! I simply cannot fault it and would highly highly recommend staying there to anyone.",

              "text": "The trip advisor says that by sharing our review on Santi Sari others will make better judgments... we care so we will share....You can not go wrong...as simple as that. The previous reviews cover nearly everything that needs to be covered. \nThe scenery and setting of the whole place and the instant feeling of peace and calm that transcends upon you as soon as you open the car door in front of the reception for the first time; the incredibly polite and friendly attitude of the staff who greet you by name as you approach them for the first time and all other times thereafter; the sounds, smells and views across the pool onto the mangroves and fishing boats afar in the sea; the incredible high quality of the food...the chocolate fondant is especially to die for, even for those who do not have a sweet tooth.\nSo many more adjectives can be used, all of them reflecting positively on Santi Sari and every aspect of hospitality.\nWe spent 9 nights here and as you would have guessed by now, we were pampered to death. The scenery, the people, the food, the atmosphere were divine.\nWe spent at least 3 days out and about visiting sights and other towns. \nThe snorkelling is a must. The hotel will arrange everything for you with their own boat off their own jetty and even arrange for your picnic lunch by the temples.\nThe massages with the natural oils from the hotels' own aloe vera plants will relax muscles you did not know you had.\nMost importantly of all, are the proprietors, Carole and Tony. One of them is always at Santi Sari but if you are fortunate enough, as we were to have them both there at the same time, then you have had double the experience of a lifetime. They make you feel as if Santi Sari is your home and that you have been friends for years....This is the icing on the cake and you will not get anything like it anywhere.....",

This place is the closest thing to paradise that we have ever seen! Amazing scenery, layout, and staff. \u00a0The room was luxurious with fine wood carving everywhere and day beds for relaxing. The rooms were so nice, we almost didn't \u00a0want to go outside. \u00a0The grounds were so nice, we almost didn't want to go to our room... Quite the struggle we had :). Everything we had at the restaurant was also very rich in flavor and we always ended our meals with a smile. We also enjoyed our time with Tony and Carol who helped us out with absolutely everything we needed. Thank you Tony and Carol for building this place and making our time there something we will never forget. We'll be back!\nPs. The pictures do not do justice for how beautiful this place is!\nMegan and Tyler",

Surrounded by a lush green mangrove area with a stunning view of a fishermen village in a distance, this resort is just simply unforgettable, We sampled various appetizers from the simple yet chique menu card. We had Tabouleh Salad, Greek salad, Mini spring rolls to name but a few and every single dish was just exceptional. We met with the ever hospitable owners Carol and Tony from UK, and they let us try the samosas too as it wasnt on the menu card yet. again, this is also a simple but yet delicious starter. a perfect place to relax after your snorkeling adventure at Menjangan Island. Highly recommendable",

              "text": "Though I've reviewed Santi Sari after our visit last year, I wanted to write a second review simply to drive home the point that this place is heavenly. Located off the beaten path in the peaceful and quiet northwestern Bali, Santi Sari is truly a boutique property. \n\nWith only a handful of rooms, but with a staff of 50, the service is second to none. No request is too small or too large. Meals can be served anywhere (in the restaurant, the rooms, and even the shaded bures which are situated next to the main pool (a smaller pool is located in the second complex of villas).\n\nThis trip, we brought our kids here; however, this isn't a destination for children. My wife and I had made good friends with Carol, one of the owners, and when we found ourselves visiting Bali again this year with our kids, they were just as excited to visit and meet her.  This year, joining her, is the resort's other owner, Tony. Both are extremely charming, sincere and really care about the guests.\n\nUnfortunately, my wife and daughter were sick for most of our six night stay. We wanted to visit the volcanos of Java, and trek the national park, but the girls were really only well enough for a visit to Menjangan Island and fantastic snorkeling (a must see!). \n\nThe massage offered is absolutely fantastic. Lasting two hours, I completely fell asleep as the cool trade winds blew past me (the service is done on the second floor above the kitchen, open to the breezes). This is extremely affordable, and well worth the time.\n\nRooms are fantastic, with the top floors offering great views out over the bay to the northeast.\n\nWe love the staff, almost all of whom were the same as from last year's visit. They all called us by our first name (which I prefer to Mr. XXX), and we looked forward to seeing them everyday.\n\nAs with last year, we visited during Ramadan, and given the higher density of Muslims in this part of Bali (due to the close proximity to Muslim Java), there are a number of nearby mosques, which, using loudspeakers and pre-recordings, serve as the muezzin to the daily prayers. However, the speakers also blare at 4am (in order to awake the faithful up to give them time to eat before the sunrises and fasting begins). Frankly, I found the constant Arabic (yes, not Indonesian or Balinese) coming from the mosques to be exotic, and really added to the environment.\n\nMy review is but one of dozens, all of which (with the exception of one) are rated at 5 stars. I'm hoping that the fact that we chose to return will encourage you to choose this wonderful property.",

Santi Sari sets the bar so high that any other place will have a hard time matching it. This is why I would  recommend to stay there towards the end of your trip :)\nThank you very much to Carole and Tony who are the perfect hosts and really know what they are doing. They took care of us in a way that made us feel at home from the minute we arrived.\nWe will be back!!",

              "text": "This place is just amazing. I could use all manner of superlatives to describe it but you can just check out the other reviews for that. I had done so, and so my expectations were very high when we arrived - I thought, there's no way this place can be as good as the reviews say. I'm happy to say I was completely wrong. While we weren't on our honeymoon, many of the other guests were and I would say it is very romantic so would be ideal for that.\n\nIt's completely stunning for a start, and the service is lovely. Everyone is so friendly. Special thanks to Tony who went completely out of his way to show us around the local area (Ed will never forget the turtle sanctuary!). To be honest you don't need to leave Santi Sari; it's so peaceful. The salt water pools are incredible, the suites are secluded, luxurious and clean. The food is epic (big thanks to the talented chef) - 5 nights and we didn't get through the whole menu so we'll have to come back for that reason alone. I also recommend the snorkelling trip and the full balinese massage.\n\nIt's fair to say there is one thing that may be a downside for some; it's a long drive from the airport (about 4 hours), but actually we found that made it all the more special and the drive itself is pretty gorgeous - so for us it wasn't a downside at all. I would recommend letting the Santi Sari team arrange this for you though - the local taxi drivers may struggle to find it as it's well off the beaten tourist track. Some people mention the call to prayer - I suppose this could be annoying in the first day or two, but everything is so relaxing that it all adds to the charm, and we were sleeping through it by night 3 anyway (and I am a very light sleeper). Tony and Carole have extensively researched the best earplugs in the world anyway so you don't need to worry.\n\nI can't wait to go back and would emphatically recommend a stay here to anyone heading to Bali. Or to anyone who wants pure luxury, peace, service, relaxation - it really is a dream.\n\nThank you Tony and the whole team. Jen and Ed x",

I now regret that I didn't book 6 or more nights as we had the most incredible time!\nSanti Sari is beyond a dream, it's beyond perfection, it's in a class of it's own.\nFrom the moment of arrival you are taken into a dream land of smiling faces, palatial rooms, mesmerizing views, exquisite food and ultimate relaxation. \nWe had to pinch ourselves every morning to make sure that it was all real and not some illusion..\nIf a 4hr drive sounds too far to get to Santi Sari, just know that it's worth it. You can even break it up and stay somewhere half way - the drive itself it very interesting, passing beautiful temples, padi fields, volcanoes and quaint villages. And if you are feeling tired when you get there, just sign yourselves up for one of their traditional Balinese Massages - it's one of the best massages we ever had, and VERY affordable.\nI'm not going to write down every little secret of this place as you have to come here and experience it yourself, a trip to Bali isn't complete without visiting Santi Sari.\nTony and Carole and all the wonderful staff at Santi Sari, Thank You for making our honeymoon magical!",

The meals in the restaurant were scrumptious and I was very impressed when we were offered very fresh catch of the day straight off the local fishing boat. The massage treatments were amazing and also very reasonable. The private boat trip from the hotel jetty to snorkel at Menjangen Island was absolutely brilliant, I am a diver and was very impressed, the corals here are world class. The owners go out of their way to make you feel welcome. I will definitely be returning to this hidden gem.",

Travelling to Bali on the strength of previous reviews of this hotel expecting to find something negative to tell you. Our mission failed - it IS perfect!!  We feel we have experienced the real Bali rather than the commercial strip of the south and the journey from the airport to Santi Sari gave the opportunity to visit the mountainous centre of the island.  \nWelcomed with a blessing and a personal tour of the hotel by the owner, Carole, it was a dream holiday from start to finish.\nPampered by the Balinese staff, who are all delightful, we enjoyed the manicured gardens, lovely pools, and great food.  Tony, the joint owner, accompanied us snorkelling as he sensed our 'first timer' nervousness. Visiting the reef was a trip of a life time ending with lunch on a deserted sandy beach. \nMuch has been made in previous reviews about the morning call to prayer when we felt it only added to a unique and magical atmosphere.\nOur thanks to Tony and Carole for making us feel like personal guests in thier little paradise.",

              "text": "We returned from Bali a few days ago and Santi Sari was our favorite place on the island, and one of the best hotels in the world we've ever stayed at. Carole, the owner, arranged for an excellent driver to pick us up on the other side of Bali and deliver us through the mountains to her little paradise. The hotel is in a non-tourist area, and it is integrated with the local ecology and culture. You don't just get a resort experience, but a unique look into the real Bali. Santi Sari is elegant, relaxed, and appears effortless, although it must take an unbelievable amount of work to keep it so perfect. The food was phenomenal and the staff was very flexible in catering to individual needs. Carole and the staff genuinely cared about every element of our stay, and made each day memorable. We snorkeled around an uninhabited island, saw local Balinese dance, were massaged into putty, and toured the rainforest and mangroves with an expert who grew up in the protected park land. The only thing that could make it better was a longer time to stay. We will be back.",

The resort has an incredible \"feel\", is extremely tranquil, and the staff is gorgeous. We arrived to the welcoming arms of Carol, and soon after, enjoyed a fantastic massage, all while gazing over the mangrove trees and watching the clouds turn pink as the sun set. \n\nOur day trip to Menjangan was hosted by Nana, who is a beautiful soul and lovely man. We saw incredible corals. The fish were bountiful and every color of the rainbow!\n\nWe really enjoyed our time at this special retreat and will be heading back soon/already telling our Bali friends. \n\nCome prepared to be pampered and amazed by everything :)",

              "text": "We wanted a very relaxing holiday after a busy week in Hong Kong and booked the Santi Sari after reading all the reviews. \nCarole, one of the owners, advised us to take half board and she chose a perfect suite for us to stay in. She arranged for a driver to pick us up from the airport with bottles of water and iced towels, sandwiches to be waiting for us in our room since we didn't arrive until 12.30 at night and all the arrangements worked perfectly. \nSanti Sari must be the one of the most peaceful places we have visited. It is immediately calming but full of interest. Tony, the other owner was our host while we stayed (it felt like we were staying with a friend) and he showed us plants and herbs that are growing in the extensive grounds while answering our questions about local culture and tradition.\nWe did several of the activities that others have recommended and they are as good as everyone says - snorkelling at Deer Island, visiting the turtle sanctuary, visiting temples and the Rice fields - the Luwak pooh coffee at the coffee plantation was interesting but we left it untasted! The massages are a must.  \nJust staying near the pools, reading and swimming - breathing in the scents from the flowers was often enough for us.\nThe rooms were stunning, food was good - we definitely recommend the half board option - more than we could eat sometimes - the cream and jam scones at tea time were particularly memorable. The staff were wonderful - so friendly and helpful - nothing was too much trouble.\n\nAs someone else said, \"very very happy\"\n\nWe'd love to return there.",

              "text": "Santi Sari is about 4 hours or more from the airport in the South.  Arrived tired around dinner time but the staff and Tony, one of the British owners were waiting to welcome me. They had a blessing ceremony, which was nice I suppose but would have liked to have been asked as I am Christian.  I went along with it in the spirit of respecting the culture of others especially in their country but it was weird for me.  Santi Sari has more of a jungle setting than a beach setting.  There really is no beach to swim or lounge in but there are some good views of the Bali sea beyond the jungle and the grounds are well kept.  If you desperately want the beach, this location is not for you.  If you are looking  to get away from it all and I do mean get away from it ALL,  you will love Santi Sari.  It is quite remotely located.  As most Balinese practice Hinduism, the owners have built this place with the Hindu religion in mind.  There is a temple on the grounds where the staff and guests (if interested) can participate in blessings and ceremonies.  The highlight of my stay was the day of snorkeling at the spectacular coral reefs on Menjangan island.  Santi Sari has a private boat and offer a packed lunch.  Tony went with us and was like a personal guide for the day.  They really do give you a personal experience.  You don't have to be an expert to snorkel here but they had someone with me as it was my first time.  You should come to Santi Sari just for the snorkeling and diving.\n\nPros of Santi Sari - Owner/manager, Tony Pinkus tries his very best to accommodate your needs.  Staff are very attentive but English is a challenge so don't get frustrated trying to explain what you need.  Food choices are decent for a 5 day stay but not beyond.   If you are vegetarian, there is plenty to choose from. Highly recommend the chocolate fondant and the Risotto.  Rooms are simply decorated but clean and spacious.  I recommend the massage.  Had two during my three day stay.  half board option for food is also a great option though you can order a la carte too.\n\nCons of Santi Sari -  Had to request things that should be standard in a hotel like this e.g., internet service in the rooms if they have internet at all.  No nightstand space beside the bed so you have to put your stuff on the floor.   My biggest Con.  I did not sleep well for all three nights I was there.  Air conditioning in the room was not powerful enough for such a large room and it had some sort of setting that they were not able to fix.  My bathroom was not air conditioned so you are pouring with sweat before you are even dressed.  Pillows were uncomfortable and I had a crane in my neck daily.  Massages helped though.  At 5am on the dot, the very loud muslim call to prayer is guaranteed to wake you up despite the ear plugs.\n\nOverall, I will return here as an excellent place to stay to go diving but not as a destination in itself - only because of the logistics of getting there.",

We stayed in a master suite and had the half board option, which proved ideal and in reality was more like full board especially as it includes afternoon tea. The suite with its pretty terraces and lovely furnishing was heavenly.  The owners, Tony and Carole, were wonderful hosts, and could not have been more welcoming, and extremely helpful and informative throughout the whole of our stay. The staff were lovely, always attentive and were both professional and friendly. The menu is extensive with both Balinese and European dishes, all beautifully cooked by the wonderful chef. We highly recommend the snorkelling and Deer Island trip, even though one of us didn't venture too far from the boat we saw lots of beautiful fish thanks to Nana and Gede. \nThe Balinese massages were delightful and made a relaxing stay even more relaxing. The saltwater swimming pools are fabulous, and the tranquil and beautifully designed gardens and lotus pools were hard to leave. We look forward to when we can return.",

Great grounds, great rooms, great bathrooms, great pools, great food, great staff.\nWe did 2 excursions- the mangrove walk and the Menjangan Island snorkelling/picnic- very, very happy. The island trip is up there in my travelling highlights list.\nIndulged in 2 massages, very enjoyable.\nHope to go back in the dry season- there is still much to do!!!",

We booked Santi Sari based on the fact that all the reviews were \"Excellent\".  We booked for 5 nights and it was hard to leave after we had stayed 7 nights.  Our host, Tony, was like a friend by the end of the week and the staff was always wonderful - attentive and helpful.  As the previous reviewer says it has a good energy about it.  \nThe rooms are beautiful and well planned and the salt water pools are  soothing.  The menu at the restaurant is extensive and everything we tried was delicious.        \nSpectacular snorkeling on Menanjen Island is only a 30 minute boat ride.  A trek in the national park is just a few minutes away.  Java is also very close and we kept thinking of going on the ferry but it was hard to leave our little \"oasis\".   Highly recommend a stay at Santi Sari.  \nThanks for a wonderful stay.",

From the moment we parked we knew we were in good hands, and the service provided by the staff was perfect from start to finish, under the attentive and graceful eye of Tony who took excellent care of us. The rooms were beautifully appointed and maintained, the grounds expansive, salt water pools were perfect, and the food was fantastic. The menu would have kept us interested for over a week with such a variety of dishes including fresh fish that can be selected from the hotel's private pier as the fishing boats come in. We will definitely be back, and next time hope to take advantage of the private boat for diving at Menjangan island. Thanks to Tony and all his wonderful staff, keep up the good work! This north western point of Bali is a must see for lovers of the island as it gives a fresh perspective to the better-known south, with plenty of nature and some of the best coral in the country.",

Everything  was just  perfect! \nOur ceremony was in small and beautiful unhabitated island by 30 min from S.S. by boat. It was ecceptional!!! I am not gonna desribe it, better look on the pictures.\n\nAtmosphere was extremely friendly! The staff made us feel like special people in a very special place\n\nThe villa which we were leaving was breath-taking! The food was  fabulous! Massage very proffesional and with reasonable price.\n\nIt is hard to find a words to express our gratefullness to Santi-Sari and the owner Tony Pinkus. What they did it was amazing! \nWe will always remember 3 days we spent there. And will definitely get back on our wedding anniversary.",

The rooms were prepared to perfection. The staff are extremely friendly. The food is delicious, unique, and affordable. The massages were wonderful and very reasonably priced. The hotel offers a private boat ride to Menjangan Island for a day of snorkeling (highly recommended!). We also trekked the nearby national park. The trek guide, recommended by Santi Sari, was a neat person to talk to for 3 hours. Unfortunately there is no beach at the hotel, but they do offer free rides to a nearby beach. The salt water pool was another unique feature.",

Upon our arrival, our first impression was delight. The main lobby is situated in a stand-alone structure featuring antique Balinese teak furniture and clean, polished marble tile. Gede greeted us with incense and a prayer. He was gracious and warmly welcoming. \n\nThen the owners emerged to greet us with smiles and hugs, and then escorted us to the restaurant. They led us down a long patio path with a thatched roof. Butterflies were everywhere. I wondered where we were headed when suddenly a Buddist statue came into view. \n\nAs we entered the main area of the resort, a gorgeous garden of peace, a lotus pond with elaborate bamboo and fresh flowers decorated for the the holidays. \n\nThey greeted us with warm conversation and fresh watermelon juice, and told us our room had been upgraded. \n\nThe room was breath-taking. A tall thatched roof, a private porch with an antique teak daybed and mosquito net for napping. Plantation chairs on the porch. The bed inside was like a cloud. The bathroom included a private double vanity area with two indoor-outdoor showers, a stone tub that retained the days solar energy. \n\nI could continue for hours about the room. \n\nThe staff made us feel like special people in a very special place. We were present for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. We enjoyed dinners with traditional live Balinese dancers, fireworks and delicious gourmet food. The other guests were also pleasant. An international group of like-minded travelers. Two groups of honeymooners. \n\nIf I stay here again I will spend much of my time relaxing at the resort. It is \"the perfect place to be stuck in Bali.\" \n\nBook all of the resort excursions. The site is well organized, and they will keep you safe. \n\nThe resort had security and is walled all around. I felt exceedingly safe the entire time of our visit. And I miss it. I will always miss Santi Sari. But I have memories and the resort is by far--my unsurpassed resort stay experience in my lifetime.",

Tony has been a lovely host, taking care about everything and ensuring that we had a very personal, familiar stay. We went for the snorkeling trip near the island in the national park and enjoyed the very relaxing massages. The pools are wonderful, and the rooms are very stylishly decorated. This place really makes a different compared to the mass market hotels. It is a individual choice. We have lots of good memories about it.\n",

As you are led from the reception area where a short greeting ritual is performed, you enter the grounds and this first inkling of having arrived someplace special is only topped by the arrival at the lotus pond, afterwhich the open-air restaurant and infinity pool greet you with a view of the sea beyond.  Although my husband and I only had three days to spend at this lovely location, the relaxation we experienced made us feel as if we had spent double the amount of time.  The staff was very attentive, polite, yet personal, and Tony, the owner, was just a joy to speak with... and even accompanied us on one of the most spectacular days of snorkeling we have ever experienced.  Although we stayed in the Lotus 2 Suite, I think I could have been happy in any of the beautiful, well-appointed rooms.  I can definitely recommend this hotel and hope that we can come again.",

              "text": "My husband and I stayed here to celebrate our wedding anniversary and we could not have chosen a better place to spend our last week. From the moment we were picked up from our previous hotel( Munduk Moding) we knew we were going to be in heaven.\nI booked direct with Carole and she was so helpful, answering all my questions, sadly we didn't meet her but were welcomed by Tony who also was the most charming man you could meet.\nWe stayed in Banyan 4 and loved the peace and tranquility, we didn't mind the local mosque or the noise of the animals as this just added to the charm of this boutique hotel.\nOn Carole and Tonys recommendation we went half board, so we dined superbly every day, breakfast was a treat and then we chose a starter for lunch and then had the remaining two courses for our evening meal, we even had scones, cream and homemade strawberry jam & tea at 4 pm so you can see we didn't starve. I was quite surprised that my clothes fitted by the end of the week, but I must admit they were getting very tight.\nBoth my husband and I had two massages which were amazing ,you are given a ginger or lemongrass & ginger tea afterwards which was much nicer than drinking water and you sit on the balcony watching the sunset- magical.\nTony took us to the local market and to view some very special temples but our most favourite trip was to go snorkelling to menjangan island. \nMy husband is a very nervous swimmer but he was looked after by Nana, who took his hand and looked after him on both snorkelling trips, my husband said it is one of the best things he has ever done. Tony took the rest of us and pointed out all the local fish/ coral and even took his underwater camera so we have photos to prove what a wonderful setting it was. We ate our packed lunch near one of the piers overlooking the volcanoes of Java and then went for a walk along the beach before heading out snorkelling again.\nThis is truly a very special place to spend your holidays and we will recommend it to all our friends, you cannot over emphasise how friendly everyone is and Tony was on hand night and day if there were any problems. The couple we went snorkelling with left at 3 am to fly back to the UK and Tony even got up to say goodbye, this goes beyond the call of duty and shows how much he looks after his guests.\nWould we go back, yes without a doubt, just start having to save up the pennies.",

              "text": "My husband and I arrived at Santi Sari 2 months ago today in the late afternoon of July 20, 2012 for 5 nights & 6 days to celebrate my birthday and our anniversary the following day.  So, we are very late in sending our review of the most spectacular place we have ever traveled. For 63 days now we have had the enjoyment of reminiscing on the most perfect vacation choice thus far.\n\nThe proprietor of Santi Sari, Carole Gregory Pinkus, was the most generous and hospitable human being we have ever met.  After traveling 5+ hours to Santi Sari, Carole met us as we entered the property with a beautiful smile and such graciousness that I knew we had entered a very peaceful and sacred place.  We were completely mesmerized by the extraordinary setting in all directions and found it difficult to say very much at first because the views of Santi Sari were so spectacular.  What awaits you as you walk across the lotus pond to the open restaurant is another breathtaking view.....the Bali Sea.  \n\nThe staff greeted us with their engaging smiles & charm and presented us with a Bali welcoming drink.  At last, we were able to relax by the pool and feast our eyes on the stunning views and architecture of Santi Sari.  After visiting with Carole and the staff for at least an hour we then walked to our Villa.  Every step we took greeted us with more breathtaking views.  Sometimes words cannot express such beauty and when this happens, it's nice to simply close your eyes...smile and be grateful.\n\nMy first sunrise at Santi Sari was on my birthday.  What beauty!  On occasion, you get to experience perfection and this was certainly that occasion.  My birthday & anniversary was celebrated with so much thoughtfulness by Carole and all her staff. She arranged a beautiful chocolate cake, singing by the staff and fireworks for both evenings.  A total surprise.  It was my first time to experience such a dramatic star lit sky and it lasted for 5 evenings.  I will never forget it!\n\nI was delighted to read Seattle Eric...\"Off The Beaten Path....\" review.  Hi Eric and Leslie. We were at Santi Sari at the same time and enjoyed snorkeling with them on the day of our anniversary.  He gives a wonderful detailed description of Santi Sari regarding the staff, the property, the sight seeing, Menjangan (Deer) Island, snorkeling....everything.  So, I will simply say....DITTO.\n\nI will not repeat what the brochure describes about the property.  It is all TRUE.  Also, the excellent ratings shared by all are indeed accurate.  I too, found it amazing that when searching this property, every comment was EXCELLENT.  That never happens but it is very clear to see why Santi Sari has this reputation.\n\nI imagine that Carole prioritizes every guests, making them feel so very special while in her care at Santi Sari.  We discovered so many similar interests about life in general that it was a pleasure spending time in conversation with her, making our stay that much more enjoyable.  All of her staff reflect her charm and professional attention to every detail.\n\nCarole, thank you for your unique vision and the opportunity to experience all that you, your entire staff and the peaceful surroundings of Santi Sari blessed us with during our vacation.\nFor those of you who have not yet traveled to Bali, make this your first stop!",

From the moment we arrived we knew we were in for a treat. The property is absolutely stunning from the natural setting overlooking the sea to the beautiful grounds and rooms. We stayed in Banyan No.1 which came complete with huge bed, satellite tv, indoor and outdoor shower, massive outdoor bath and our own fishpond! The gardens and two pools are just beautiful, there are so many spots to relax from the restaurant to the sun loungers and day beds scattered throughout, so many statues, more fishponds and views to admire and all in the most peaceful setting imaginable. Carole, the co-owner, was there throughout our stay and could not have done any more to make us feel more welcome, we miss you Carole! A special mention to the staff, all staff, who were so genuinely warm and friendly and hello to Kama who encouraged us to step outside the grounds even though he knew we were having too good a time lolling around our private garden! The food is fabulous in the restaurant, the fresh fruit and yoghurt delicious at breakfast, we had so many dinners we worked our way through the menu, for me the best part was the chocolate fondant, I wanted to run away to lick the plate, divine! We actually did leave one day but by boat to visit the nearby island where we went snorkelling (my first time and all my nerves quelled by the nicest guide), spotted the local deer and had a great day out. Definitely worth the trip. We also took advantage of the massages on offer, and just generally had an amazing time sunbathing, swimming, relaxing and eating! This is undoubtedly the place to go if you want to chill out in the most beautiful surroundings imaginable and feel like you are in your own little corner of paradise \u2013 don\u2019t hesitate, go as soon as you can! We will be back\u2026",

              "text": "My wife Leslie and I found Santi Sari on Trip Advisor, and were honestly surprised that every single review was given 5 stars; how is this possible? What spell is cast upon guests upon arrival? We decided to discover the truth for ourselves.\n\nTo get to Santi Sari, we took a 3.5 hour drive from Ubud. The first hour is all about traffic. Our driver jockeyed for space on the road with the omnipresent swarm of countless scooters. As we rose into the beautful interior mountains, the hubub of southern Bali slipped away. \n\nWe were met upon arrival by the owner/proprietor, a lovely british woman named Carole, who became very dear to us over the course of our stay. She created the Santi Sari originally with the intention of it being her private residence; but during construction, she changed up her plans, adding a second story in both structures (there's a main structure with 4 accommodations, and a guest house with 6 accommodations).\n\nWe stayed in one of the owner's suites (Carole lived in the other one). One of the few differences between this category of accommodation and others is the addition of a second bedroom (which we didn't use, since there was just the two of us).\n\nThe hotel is built aligned east to west, taking full advantage of the vector of the trade winds, which blew through our room as well as the public areas all day long. Sunrises are exquisite, an explosion of light rising from the Bali Sea, visible from our bed. Sunsets are also beautiful, with only a walk to Santi Sari's private dock will reveal the sun setting behind the 6000+ feet of three Java volcanos.\n\nThe service is the best we've experienced in Bali - and that's saying a lot as this is our third trip to Bali, and we've stayed at six different properties over those trips. The restaurant staff, the housekeepers - all were so extraordinarily warm - they came to feel like family, and it was sad to have to say goodbye.\n\nFor a small boutique hotel in the middle of the proverbial nowhere, the food is fantastic. A huge menu that includes western favories as well as indonesian favorites (including Mie Goreng - a Balinese noodle dish that is to die for). Be prepared to pay through the tooth for alcohol, but this is an Indonesian 400% tax on booze problem, nothing that Santi Sari can do about it.\n\nWe stayed 4 nights, 3 days - 2 of which were spent at Menjangen (deer) island, a small island located about an hour's boat ride from Santi Sari's dock via twin engine boat. I went on a two tank dive one of the days, and snorkeling on the second. My wife snorkeled both days. The sealife was amazing - sea stars the blue of dusk sky, clown fish dancing around the protection of undulating coral - all was amazing.\n\nWe also visited the island's various temples, and even saw one of the deer for which the island is named. The whole experience was fantasic - if the skies are clear, the reward is a breathtaking view of Java's towering volcanos just across the straight of Bali. \n\nThe property is fantastic - we spent one of our days just lounging around the pool and enjoying the atmosphere of the location. Need coffee, a drink while hanging out in your room? Just dial 116 and the restaurant will send up whatever you'd like.\n\nFor our final evening, Carole arranged a troupe of balinese dancers (all younger than 15), as well as some fireworks in honor of the wedding anniversary of one of the couples staying at the hotel.\n\nOh yes, then there are the call to prayers. We were at Santi Sari just as Ramadan began. There are a number of mosques in this part of Bali, which makes sense given the close proximity with Java. Most of Bali is Hindu, however, most of Indonesia is Muslim. In this part of Bali Muslims are more prevalent.\n\nThe worst time is the 4:30 noise - er, call to prayer. Blaring from 4+ different sources, the only hope is to be able to fall back asleep when it ends 45 minutes later. Apparently, during Ramadan, this call is to wake muslims so they can eat before the fasting begins at sunrise. Makes sense, but still annoying.\n\nDon't let this little nuisance stop you from considering Santi Sari - it's a peaceful location, staffed by wonderful people who really care about you having the best service possible. There's always one of the owners there. Carole and Tony trade off every couple of months, spending their off time back in England.",

              "text": "After a grueling, 26 hour journey from London, we were in a bit of a shambles when we arrived at Santi Sari to receive our welcome drink. However, even the jet lag didn\u2019t prevent us from marveling at the palatial, botanical splendor of this remote resort. The attention to detail is impressive. Flowers blooming everywhere, shrines, sumptuous daybeds and lounge chairs scattered throughout the grounds, enormous four-poster bed\u2014even the bathroom door had us oohing and aahing, never mind the boulder-hewn tub with the private fish pond out back. In fact, our (upgraded!) suite was so immediately lovely I began to feel a bit guilty as in: does anyone really deserve this level of understated, stylish luxury? What makes me so special? (Here the wife informs that my backpacker days are now, blessedly, well and truly behind me and that I need to get over myself.)\n\nSanti Sari is quite a ways off the beaten track, four hours plus from the airport, and the drive only begins to get interesting about an hour outside of Denpasar. It\u2019s actually an odd location for a resort of this standard, tucked in a mostly rural area between a small village and a recovering mangrove forest. Be forewarned: aside from the somewhat grubby, black-sand expanse of nearby Pemuteran, there are no beaches here and any sun worship is to be done by two refreshing, mildly saline pools (one of which is just long enough for laps if you have the wherewithal). Unless you have your own transport, you are at the mercy of the hotel for exploring the surrounding area, which is not a bad thing as the genial owner, Tony, is an amusing, calm and informative guide. To this end, we had an formidable day\u2019s snorkeling off of Menjangan island from the hotel\u2019s private jetty (lovely soft corals, varied fish life but overall the reef\u2019s a bit degraded from overuse\u2014still, a worthwhile visit and we would have loved to have seen the temple in action on a High Holy day), a mildly interesting guided ramble, organized by the resort, barely inside the national park (wish we would have taken a more challenging trek that went a bit deeper than, erm, the mangroves by the side of the highway, sorry) and a frankly revelatory trip to some temples off the beaten path as shown to us by Tony.\n\nOther than that, this is a place to relax, unwind and rejuvenate. The food is simply stunning: varied, gourmet, with local and European delights, tailored to your tastes. There were excellent salads, gorengs, local seafood, satay (had the chicken at least three times), delicious cocktails, wicked puddings\u2014 some of the best food I\u2019ve ever had on holiday\u2026 this does, however, come at Western Metropolitan prices, which is understandable given the quality and the remote location but still a bit of a sting. Expect to pay about 150,000-200,000 Rp for lunch and 180,000- 350,000 Rp for dinner, pp, including drinks.\n\nThe staff are relaxed, efficient and unfailingly polite\u2014\ngenuine smiles all around, and we felt grateful to be included in their New Moon ceremony at the resort\u2019s private, well-kempt temple. Our room was kept spotless, generally cleaned from top to bottom before we\u2019d finished breakfast, the grounds were immaculate and simply watching the wait-staff float gracefully across the lily pond with your dinner under metal cloches was a romantic and luxurious experience.\n\nOne major downside-- which to be fair has nothing to do with the hotel but does warrant a sidenote: maybe you\u2019ve read about the mosques broadcasting calls to prayer five times per day? And maybe you\u2019ve thought to yourself: no big deal, part of the local culture, I didn\u2019t mind the mosques in Cairo or Morocco or where-ever... Then you\u2019re shown a pair of earplugs in the nightstand by the bed at Santi Sari and think, Nah, it can\u2019t be as bad as all that. And then it starts. At 4 am. And it is bleedin\u2019 LOUD. Friday night is diabolical. And, sadly, the muezzin is not near as melodious as the guy in Cairo. And there are several of them. On competing, echoing sound systems. With feedback from the speakers. Needless to say, we did not convert. Though it made for some interesting discussions.\n\nFinal bits and bobs: there\u2019s satellite TV, wireless access, few mosquitoes though they are around, Tony graciously let us use his computer to confirm our outgoing flights, there\u2019s a little fridge with an honor system for drinks by the smaller pool, complimentary water was greatly appreciated, fine bath products, ample mossie nets, perfect little touches and amenities all around--- all in all an excellent way to experience this remote, sleepy little corner of Western Bali.",

              "text": "My partner and I spent a wonderful 7 days at this beautiful hotel. This really is a get-away-from-it-all retreat, nestled in a quiet bay far away from the tourist centres of the south of Bali. We were upgraded to a stunning master suite with day beds inside and out (as well as a huge 'normal' bed, equipped with mosquito net).  The bathroom was luxury itself, half inside and half outside - twin wash basins, two showers and a huge granite outdoor bath, topped off with our very own garden and fishpond!  We spent many a lazy day on the huge pagoda-covered daybeds by the hotel's two pools and spoiled ourselves with Balinese massages - which I can highly recommend.  The service was excellent throughout. Our host Tony really couldn't have done any more for us. He arranged a fantastic snorkling trip to Menjangan island (a short boat ride from the hotel's private jetty), a trek in the nearby national park, and personally took us on a couple of trips to hidden away temples, rice fields and Pemuteran bay and turtle sanctuary.  The staff at the hotel were absolutely wonderful, always smiling and providing excellent service at all times. And the food was fresh and delicious. Virtually all seafood and vegetarian.  If you are looking for an off-the-beaten-track experience in Bali and like to be spoilt, this is the place to stay.",

              "text": "We had such a wonderful stay at Santi Sari. The house was beautifully decorated, with attention to details such as Balinese woodwork, outdoor bath and your own veranda with views of the garden and the sea. The hotel arrange the transport and the car was very comfortable. 3,5 hours drive from Denpasar, across the mountains and its all worth it! You get away from the tourist areas and find a stunning landscape, views of Java and peaceful environment. You feel you\u00b4re the only guest (except for geckos). True luxury a million times better than the posh hotels in Ubud, great food and excellent service but there were little things that made it really special. For instance, there\u00b4s a filled fridge with cold drinks where you simply wrote down what you had taken instead of having to call room service. Two pools with views of the sea. Day beds to relax and hide from the sun. Highly recommend a boat trip to Menjangan. We snorkeled, but its also great for diving. Lots and lots of barracudas, clownfish, napolean, morena and octopus just spectacular!",

              "text": "The words \"relaxing\" and \"peaceful\" are far too frantic to describe this little part of heaven on earth. The photographs on the web site really do not do Santa Sari justice as it is breathtakingly beautiful and makes you feel privileged to be allowed to stay there. The rooms/bungalows are immaculate with a level of design and finish that just puts a huge grin on your face every time you walk in or wake up. We stayed in Banyan 1 which had the additional attraction of a massive bath carved out of granite which was warmed by the sun, big enough for two and took a surprisingly short time to fill. Just the way to unwind after an exhausting few hours checking out the piles of cushions on the luxurious canopied daybeds, olympic-standard floating around in the pool, (take your pick of two) or a gruelling marathon session on the sun loungers. Dry off with a big fluffy towel and slip on the complimentary sarong (not quite David Beckham but I thought I looked good) while you summon the energy to put a few clothes on and ring for a couple of pre-dinner gin and tonics to be brought to your verandah. If you look particularly drained they will even pour your tonic for you. You then have to head to the pool side restaurant where you are relentlessly bullied by lovely, smiling, and attentive staff into eating delicious meals which are beautifully presented and served at a gentle pace allowing you time to savour the food and the views in equal measure. Eventually you have to summon your last vestiges of strength to walk back to your room but be careful as you might develop a nastily cricked neck trying to take in the countless millions of stars, as light pollution has not been discovered here yet. We cannot speak highly enough of this resort, so thank you Carole and your wonderful team who made us feel so welcome and who simply could not do enough to ensure that we wanted for nothing. Ten days had flown past in no time and saying goodbye to you all left a genuine lump in our throats.",

Santi Sari was definitely a highlight of our trip that we treasure.  After an extremely stressfully, exhausting working period a holiday was hoped would remedy our stressed out minds and bodies. This was more than accomplished at Santi Sari.\n\nThe serene surroundings include luscious gardens intermingled with daybeds, lotus pools, ocean mangrove views and 2 devine salt water swimming pools.\nThe restaurant has 5 star food and service with a creative western and Balinese menu.  This is really something not to be missed and we feel so appreciative to all who thought up these creative meals and poured so much love into them.\nI must make special mention of the Basil, Lemongrass sorbet, my fav!\n\nThe luxurious suites have large, very comfortable beds making for the most restful sleep I've had in a long time.  We felt like royalty.  There is a lot of heart in everything at Santi Sari and that's why it really is a place of healing.  \n\nThe staff are a very big part of the heart felt warmth of Santi Sari.  Smiling, warm and catering to your every need with such peaceful joy it is touching beyond belief.\n\nThank you to all at Santi Sari.  We hope to return soon!!",

Situated in the less frenetic north west part of Bali, this boutique hotel is one of the few places in the world that we would revisit. We cannot fault the location, the rooms, the staff, the food and the management. Some have complained about the Muslim call to prayer early in the morning - rubbish! It didn't wake us up and anyway what do some travellers expect when they travel to foreign places?! As for the trip North it was amazing. The views were stunning alongside the fascinating window on everyday 'real' Bali life - not to be missed. Make sure you make this trip in daylight and allow time to stop at interesting places. Thank you Carole (and Tony who we didn't meet) for creating  this little corner of paradise.",

              "text": "Had a very pleasant stay at the Santi Sari. My wife and I were pleasantly surprised by the thought and detail that has gone into creating this most relaxing oasis from the somewhat chaotic Balinese infrastructure.\nThe staff were very well trained and attentive. Food was consistently very good. Salt-water swimming pools recommended. The owner(s) were on hand to provide a personal service and nothing was too much trouble.\nOnly Negatives were the early morning calls from the local mosques (though ear-plugs are thoughtfully provided) though this is prevelant throughout the Island.\nBe aware also that it is a somewhat arduous trip from the airport (albeit through some stunning mountainous terrain and rice paddies). I would argue it's worth it as this coastal part of the island is much less developed than much else of the periphery.\nIdeally you need transport to explore the local temples, get inland and mingle with the locals or if you want beach access (4 miles to Permuteran) as the sea access here is via mangroves",

The resort is beautiful and I would definitely recommend this place to stay to experience paradise in beautiful rural Bali.  We were lucky enough to be in Bali for a special Hindu holiday and tony, the owner, took us around the temples for the day.  This was a special experience that i will never forget.  \n\nWould recommend wearing ear plugs as the very early morning call for prayer is extremely loud!!",

              "text": "After a gruelling 30 hour journey we arrived in the dark. Our exhaustion seemed to disappear once we showered and changed and took in our first glimpses. We ate on that first night relishing our surroundings and anticipating our 8 nights of luxury.\n\nTony was our host, we did not meet Carole with whom I had made the booking. He is very likeable and we spent a lot of time together, he was kind enough to take us on an outing along the coast which we really enjoyed. Lovina we liked and had afternoon tea in the german bakery which is also a deli. Just to the right there is a new shop which sells jewellery, it is very cheap and I wish I had bought more.\n\nIt was the slow season in november and after the first night we were \"home alone\" so to speak. Never before have we had 50 staff to attend to us and of course they all knew our names so we felt very spoiled. The first few days we relaxed by our pool,  which was a joy to swim in. My husband took up residence in one of the many gazeebos, reading and dozing!!\nWe did the snorkelling trip which was very good, fantastic corals, but the water visibility was not so good for seeing big fish. Mu husband did see a stingray though. Nano, our guide, snorkelled with us ensuring safety and the best spots. Very good idea!\n\nWe ate in the restaurant as there really is nowhere else nearby. The menu however is varied enough and there was normally a different fresh fish. The restaurant staff are delighful, all local, and  speak english. The MD, Gday(sorry about spelling) is very well travelled having worked on cruise ships for a time before \"going home\" to be with his family. He invited us to a Hindu Ceremony in the temple in the hotel grounds. It was a unique experience, attended by all the staff. A memory to treasure.\n\nMy husband had his first ever massage which wiped him out for 2 days! Mine included using the local fresh aloe vera, my skin has never been so soft.\n\nIt was husbands birthday and the staff carved the words on a fresh coconut for him. After dinner a chocolate fondant pudding was sculpted into a beautiful birthday cake. He does not normally have a sweet tooth but deemed it to be delicious.\n\nCarole and Tony have put so much into this place striving for the perfection they demand. The suites are large and luxurious, the bed the most comfortable we have ever slept in, 2 showers and a bath, a daybed inside and one on the terrace.The views over the sea are dreamy and now the wallpaper on my phone so I never forget. The photos on the website hardly do it justice. I am pretty hard to please but could not fault it. The staff are trained to meet their high standards, and obviously enjoy working in such a superb environment.\n\nWe drove through the Bali most people know, or have visited, and were so pleased to have found this little corner of paradise.",

A truely Magical Place. A few hours north of Kuta and Seminyak you drive through wonderful countryside- mountains, rice paddies, small villages....... then back down to the Northern Ocean side of the Island. \nOn arrival, we were greeted by very friendly staff who gave us a tour of the property. THe gardens are tranquil and peaceful..... no wonder as the property was developed with Sacred Love of the surroundings.Two pools a lovely dining/bar area, an International menu that emcompasses many cuisines, will leave no one wanting to leave. \nThey also have a private island that is off shore for sunning and snorkling........... \nThe rooms are large and open, very clean and inviting.\nTruely an amazing spot on an incredible Island!!!! Worth the drive??? You bet!",

The rooms are spacious and out of this world, in a peaceful setting with nice gardens and as there were not many guests we had our own swimming pool. there are two in total, one in front of the Restaurant which serves great Breakfast, it is a really nice place to spend some quality time in Bali. We did the Boat trip to Menjangan, one of the best spots I have seen in Bali, being living here for seven years. The guides were very helpful as I am not really into snorkeling but they helped me through my fears and showed me the wonderful underwater world, like swimming in an aquarium!! Then picnic on the Beach, little rest and back to our wonderful Hotel. If you plan a trip in Bali - don't miss this Spot!",

              "text": "We discovered Santi Sari by coincidence on our trip through Bali.\nAfter a beautiful trip from the south of Bali to the north we arrived in the village Permuteran in the late afternoon. We started looking for a nice place to stay for just a few days. There are a lot of hotels in this area but we just could not find what we were really looking for. We decided to drive back to an other village near Permuteran but on our way through Permuteran we saw a sign from Santi Sari Boutique Hotel. We decided to check it out and we are glad we did!!! To describe Santi Sari in words is not easy because for us Santi Sari is so much more than just a fantastic and beautiful hotel; it's an experience that you will never forget. It may sound really cliche but this hotel is heaven on earth! The owners Carole and Toni from the UK have build this hotel together with the local community. The staff is excellent and genuine friendly. The rooms are beautiful and relaxing and they all have a great vieuw over the mangrove. The hotel has a beautiful garden were you can lay down on the poolbeds or relax in one of the gazebo's and listen to the songs of tropical birds. The 2 pools, with biologically treated seawater that feels like silk on your skin, have a great view over the mangrove and the ocean. Every afternoon you are treated with a spectacular show of swallow birds diving over the pool. The restaurant, overlooking the pool, serves excellent dishes and the staff makes sure that you are terated like a king. The hotel has a private boot that brings you to the best snorkling and diving spot of Bali, Menjangan island. So if you are looking for privacy, peace, great food, great massage's, pure nature and the real Bali smile then you should visit Santi Sari for sure!! Eventually we stayed 10 days at Santi Sari Boutique Hotel and we will go back!!\n\nKimm & Maurice (from Holland)\nP.S. We know Bali very well and we have been in a lot of hotels not only in Bali but all over the world. This hotel stands out for many reasons; it's firts class in many ways and we recommand it to everybody who is looking for a very special place.",

From the moment we arrived we were graciously welcomed and immediately felt relaxed and at home. The level of service is like no other as it is run by some of the nicest and kindest people you will ever have the pleasure of meeting. The onsite restaurant is truly gourmet and world class. We highly recommend going on their private boat to explore and snorkel. Santi Sari will always be remembered as one of the most special places we have visited.",

              "text": "As usual when when planning our trip to Bali we looked at the Trip Advisor reviews having heard about Santi Sari from another source. Our initial reaction was \"too good to be true\" however it lived up to all our expectations.\nFrom the moment we were greeted by the serene and elegant Carole and her colleagues we were made to feel at home. It was like arriving at a friend's country house. Indeed that is the atmosphere that Carole has managed to create. She has very cleverly blended truly excellent service with a discreet but friendly approach. Everything on the surface is calm and relaxed and it's not until you get to know Carole better you realise how hard she has worked to create this little piece of heaven.\nWe chose to stay in Palm 2 which is on the upper floor and has the most amazing views in all directions. It's a stunning suite which blends amazing Balinese fittings with modern facilities including excellent air conditioning.\nWe stayed for 8 nights and very quickly felt at home to the point that we didn't want to leave. For someone who finds it hard to relax, within 24 hours I was completely into the tranquil rhythm of the place whether it be simply chilling on the balcony or by the pool or enjoying the delicious food. \nThe staff are just wonderful. They are young and sometimes a little shy but that adds to their charm. Unlike many places in Bali they are truly friendly not at all complacent or jaded by demanding guests.\nBecause Santi Sari is so cleverly laid out with, in effect, two separate pools and poolside areas its often hard to believe that there is anyone else there other than at meal times when one can choose to be a deaux or be more social and join in conversation with Carole and her other guests.\nAn absolute must whilst at Santi Sari is to take advantage of the hotel boat and dive guide, Nana and take a trip to Menjangan Island to snorkel or dive. I was a very nervous swimmer but had always wanted to snorkel. I decided that this was the time and put my trust in Nana to whom I will always be truly grateful for enabling me to enjoy this underwater paradise. His calm and friendly manner gave me total confidence and I overcame my fears within moments especially knowing that he was right by my side if I felt at all uncomfortable .\nSo sitting at a Uk airport in the grey and rain I find myself with a smile on my face as I transport my mind back to this magical place called Santi Sari !",

Carol, our hostess was warm and friendly,  nothing was too much trouble for her and her fantastic team.  We had many adventures, perhaps the most memorable was a sunset trip to Menjangan Island. \nThe leve of comfort was outstanding and our room was one of the best we have ever stayed in, I particularly loved the fresh blue and white decor which was so relaxing.  The food is excellent and candle lit dinner time round the pool is a treat.  Perhaps the nicest thing of all was being brought the best chocolate cake and cups of Earl Grey tea as we lounged on the comfy day bed by the beautiful pool.  The gardens, the flowers, the lotus pond and the little temple all add to the aura of peace and tranquility.",

              "text": "Me and my partner stayed at Santi Sari for two days and we would highly recommend this boutique hotel to all.  Our room was spacious, very clean and had the most incredible outside views.  The air conditioning worked a treat and we had a gazebo, swimming pool and eating area right on our doorstep.  The hotel restaurant is situated right next to a lotus pond, once again great views. The hotel also has a temple on site, we were invited to a ceremony and got a real feel for the Balinese Hinduism religion.  I also tried a Balinese massage from the hotel\u2019s spa and it was literally the best massage I\u2019ve ever had \u2013 at such a great price too!  The hotel has their own private boat and carries out trips to Menjangan Island; we went snorkelling and later had the time to explore the Island, which was beautiful! We saw spectacular views on the way there, on the Island and on our way back and even passed a bat cave and a beautiful sea temple, which was very interesting to see.  My partner caught glimpses of flying fish which unfortunately I kept missing as I was distracted by the beautiful mountainous scenery, can\u2019t complain with that!\n \nThe hotel owner (Tony) was very kind and took the time to help us plan the rest of our journey, which we are very grateful as his recommendations were spot on.  The staff were also incredibly friendly, so friendly in fact, that when asked if we wanted to try some coconut juice, a staff member climbed a palm tree (unaided) to go and get us some!  To sum it up, I hate to sound cheesy but this was pretty close to paradise.",

              "text": "We loved the hotel.  Just happened to call in and once you get past the road a \" shangri la\" awaits. Rooms amazing.  Beautifully proportioned, great beds, air con works to perfection, showers flood you, lots, and I mean lots, of space to relax in  and nothing out of place. The atmosphere of tranquality and peace which gradually enfolds you as you walk from reception only gets stronger. The grounds have been crafted to perfection.  Places to hide and meditate and places to socialise. Lovely pools. Its hard to believe its only 10 months old. The food was as the sign said \"gourmet\". Great selection and cooked and presented to perfection. The staff... well what can one say.  So lovely, friendly and welcoming.  From the blessing at the time of checking in to the farewell we felt like special guest of a great big \"family\". Just happened to mention I liked green coconuts and they were waiting when we returned from diving.  We went diving with Nana and Giday and had a great day. They were so kind and friendly. Fish life mind blowing. Right up there with the Great Barrier Reef and more fish than most Pacific islands we have been to.  A special thank you to Carol who made us feel more than just a couple of dusty kiwis arriving on a scooter.. Would we go back. Sure. Just a littlle thing.  Would be nice to have a small frig in the room for cold water.",

Les verts des feuillages des arbres de la mangrove sont un \u00e9crin pour l'eau bleue qui scintille au loin et qui rythme le bateau au bout de la passerelle en bois qui vous conduira \u00e0 l'\u00eele si vous souhaitez d\u00e9couvir la faune sous-marine. \n\nTony, le ma\u00eetre des lieux, est omnipr\u00e9sent, et il a su transmettre sa fa\u00e7on d'\u00eatre l\u00e0 pour chacun de ses guests \u00e0 route son \u00e9quipe dont vous sentirez  le regard  discret et bienveillant \u00e0 chaque  moment. C'est cela qui fait que je me suis sentie privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e pendant mon s\u00e9jour de 3 jours, d'autant plus qu'\u00e9tant tomb\u00e9e malade, j'ai pu b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des rem\u00e8des magiques de Tony, pharmacien de formation, mais passionn\u00e9 d'hom\u00e9opathie. \nJ'\u00e9tais venue sans attentes particuli\u00e8res, je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9crit, mais je suis partie enrichie de cette rencontre sp\u00e9ciale, de vue fabuleuses sur la mer depuis les diff\u00e9rents beds ext\u00e9rieurs toujours fleuris de frangipaniers, rassasi\u00e9e de bonne cuisine, r\u00e9chauff\u00e9e de chaleur humaine. \nJe voudrais aussi signaler l'\u00e9norme attention port\u00e9e par Yasrawi le manager au sourire ensoleill\u00e9, ainsi que la d\u00e9licatesse de l'accueil siti Fatimah et Indah qui vous isole du monde en quelques secondes, la pr\u00e9sence discr\u00e8te et adorable de Kariani, Mesi, Sukawati, Utin et Arini, au restaurant ou le service se fait dans les r\u00e8gles de l'art et la jolie vaisselle, et ou les tables sont dress\u00e9es au bord de la piscine au bleu de r\u00eave,  ainsi que le professionnalisme du jardinier qui nous a appris \u00e0 planter des noix de coco en leur tranchant le c\u00f4t\u00e9. \nMerci \u00e0 tous, \nJe ne sais pas si je reviendrais \u00e0 Bali, mais j'emporte ce bout de Bali dans mon coeur.",

              "text": "Un sejour inoubliable a maints egards.\nNous fumes royalement accueillis par le sourire de Carole, ce qui laissait presager d'un merveilleux sejour.\nLe but de notre sejour etait de passer les fetes de Noel en amoureux, loin de l'agitation de Kuta, etre pres de la Nature et profiter - dans un endroit agreable - des diverses excursions possibles dans la region.\nNous avons eu en plus un immense plaisir de discutter avec les proprietaires Tonny et Carole, qui - en plus d'etre incroyablement accueillant et chaleureux - nous ont organise toutes nos excursions selon nos attentes et meme plus.\nL'hotel est situe au bord de la mangrove.Le jardin s'etend jusqu'a la mangrove. Tonny se fera un plaisir de vous expliquer l'equilibre de l'ecosysteme (ils ont contribue a mettre en valeur la zone, et nous y sommes sensibles, car proches de la nature, ecologie, etc..) et vous aurez le plaisir de vous promener dans le jardin et la mangrove. Vous embrasserez aussi les montagnes environnantes. Ce lieu a vraiment une aura particuliere.\nles suites sont parfaitement integrees au jardin et nous avons particulierement apprecie la vue sur le jardin et la baie, depuis la terrasse.\nC'est toujours un plaisir de se promener pieds nu sur un sol en bois tropical. La chambres etait decoree avec gout: un lit confortable en bois avec baldaquin pour supporter la moustiquaire. des meubles en bois aussi. La salle de bain fantastique, avec une baignoire en pierre massive, retenant la chaleure de la journee pour la restituer le soir lors d'un bain delicieux, avec les nombreuses fleurs de frangipanier flottant a la surface. Un bassin avec des poissons dans le petit jardin de la salle de bain pour completer la sensation d'apaisement.\nLe restaurant est situe au bord d'une des nombreuses psicine, avec vue sur la mangrove. Vous pouvez vour refugier dans l'immense  salon a l'etage pour admirer la vue sur la baie.\nLe petit dejeuner offrait un choix varie, ainsi en est il de la carte pour les dejeuners/diners.\nRien a redire au noveau service, avec l'eternel sourrire et gentillesse balinais.\nAu niveau excurssions, il ne faut surtout pas manquer la plongee/snorkelling autour de l'ile de Menjangan (plutot 2 fois qu'une!), un des rares spots encore preserve a Bali.\nMais aussi les nombreuses balades dans les forets tropicales  environnantes, faisant partie du parc nationnal. Appreciable, pour une fois en Indonesie, de ne pas avoir la nature souillee pas des sacs plastiques :o(\nTony nous a fait gagner un temps precieux en organisant a merveille les excurions, avec des gens de confiance et serieux (emerveillement garanti), ce qui n'est malheureusement pas toujours le cas en Indonesie.\nNous regrettons juste de ne pas avoir pu voir le lever de soleil sur la baie (le temps etait couvert), au bout de la jetee.\nC'est sur, nous reviendrons!Et nous gardons de merveilleux souvenirs, que ce soit des excursions ou de nos discussions/echanges avec Tonny et Carole",

La excursion de buceo fue increible, te llevan cuando quieras con su bote y disfrutas de una variedad increible de peces sin el agobio de otras excursiones organizadas que vas con mucha gente. Los masajes geniales, superrelajantes.... La unica pega por poner alguna cosa negativa de nuestra estancia es la distancia desde el aeropuerto, pero merece la pena la tranquilidad del sitio. No tengo palabras suficientes para agradecer a todo el personal del hotel lo bien que nos trataron. Muchas gracias Toni por todos tus consejos de actividades y hospitalidad.",
