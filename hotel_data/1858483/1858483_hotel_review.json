Hanya saja kekurangannya adalah tidak ada variasi makanan untuk makan pagi karena menunya itu-itu saja walaupun bisa memilih, mungkin akan lebih baik kedepannya memberikan variasi pilihan makanan yang lebih banyak.",

Akses wi-fi sangat jelek, saya terpaksa memakai aktifitas internet menggunakan sinyal seluler sendiri selama berada disana\n2. Tirai penutup kamar yang berada di lantai paling atas rusak dan kami tidak bisa membuka lebar padahal kami ingin memanfaatkan momen berfoto dengan view laut tapi terhalang oleh tirai\n3. Jacuzzi nya rusak dan diperbaiki pada saat kami memberitahukan, yang jadi masalah kenapa pihak villa tidak mengecek sebelum ada tamu yang datang\n4. Tombol lampu yang katanya smart villa ini nyatanya banyak yang tidak berfungsi DAN lagi-lagi kami memanggil teknisi untuk memperbaiki DAN sekali lagi kenapa mereka tidak mengecek sebelumnya\n5. Payung dipinggir kolam rusak dan terpaksa saya yang harus membuka sendiri serta memperbaiki sendiri agar view pada saat difoto jadi bagus\n6. Obor yang mestinya dapat kami manfaatkan didekat tebing ternyata rusak dan alasan pihak villa itu sudah lama rusak, WOW sungguh alasan yang sangat bijak untuk villa dengan harga sewa yang lumayan ini\n7. Pintu kamar mandi yang berada di lantai paling bawah juga tidak bisa tertutup rapat\n8. Bangunan nya juga banyak yang sudah rusak, kotor, berlumut, terkesan tidak dirawat\nKesimpulan : untuk harga sewa yang jutaan dengan mendapat fasilitas seperti ini saya JANJI tidak akan mau datang kesini lagi, masih banyak villa yang harga nya dibawah namun lebih bagus",

Ketika kami tiba di pagi hari, kami ngeri, kami diberitahu oleh manajer penjualan asisten bahwa ada tidak lebih 2 - kamar tidur villas. Rupanya ada beberapa miskomunikasi antara hotels.com dan C151. Kami sangat tegas dalam meminta dia untuk memberi kita ruang karena kita dibayar penuh, dan jelas kita tidak ingin tidur di jalanan tanpa tempat tinggal! Dia terganggu dan setuju untuk memberi kami 3 - kamar tidur vila (dengan 3 kamar terkunci) pada hari 1, dan villa presiden hari ke-2. Kedua Vila-vila yang dari desain yang sama, tetapi villa presiden memiliki taman yang lebih besar, dan outdoor jacuzzi. Kelemahan dari villa ini adalah bahwa ada banyak barang kecil yang tidak bekerja - monitor dari sistem keamanan, keran di toilet tertentu cukup sulit untuk menyalakan, layar LCD dari jacuzzi dalam ruangan tidak bekerja, dan kontrol volume dari speaker yang berbeda yang tidak akurat. Kekecewaan besar adalah ketika brosur mereka menyatakan layanan spa akan tersedia 10:00-08:00 setiap hari, kita benar-benar mengambil bahwa dalam dan berpikir satu-satunya kali kita tidak bisa memiliki pijat adalah 08:00-10:00, dan dipanggil untuk pijat di 8 + pm pada hari terakhir, dan diberitahu bahwa pijat adalah 10:00-20:00. Namun, itu masih tinggal yang menyenangkan untuk us.24h butler service adalah plus besar, dan makanan memerintahkan melalui layanan kamar terjangkau, lezat dan baik didirikan oleh Butler kami.

              "text": "Villa C151 benar-benar luas dan sangat mewah. Lokasinya sangat dekat dengan pantai, restoran yang bagus, serta bar seperti di Seminyak. Bahkan ada pasar di samping, juga sebuah restoran kecil yang bagus - Sate Bali yang mengadakan kursus memasak dan sangat cocok untuk sajian yang dibawa pulang jika kita tidak ingin meninggalkan villa. karena kami sangat terpesona dengan kamarnya, kami tidak terlalu memperhatikan demonstrasi teknologi yang seharusnya kami miliki dan membuat kami terlepas beberapa kali - seperti tidak bisa membuka tirai atau tidak bisa mematikan lampu sepenuhnya - stafnya sangat bersedia membantu, tetapi tip dari saya adalah memberikan perhatian (jika anda bisa) kami memiliki villa dengan 2 kamar tidur dengan 2 X tempat tidur King size, 2 kamar mandi marmer besar dan satu kamar mandi marmer yang lebih kecil (tetpai cukup besar). Ditambah kolam pribadi 15 meter, area dapur/bersantai yang luas dan ruangan media yang terpisah. Banyak tempat - harganya terjangkau, sarapannya hebat - stafnya ramah dan suka menolong. Satu-satunya masukan dari saya hanya pilihan kombinasi menu dapat disederhanakan untuk memenuhi berbagai selera - namun tetap, ini hal yang sangat menyenangkan.",

The actual villa is as per the photos that I saw on the website - spacious, clean looking & comfy like home. We liked the 2 big bedrooms with 2 connecting extra big indoor bathrooms. The indoor bathrooms were truly important for us as we were mostly attacked by the armies of mosquitoes in previous trips where we booked villas with outdoor bathrooms. The private pool is beautiful but the water is extremely cold throughout and pretty deep (1.5m to 1.7m I think) so please make sure that the young ones are accompanied. The location of the villa is excellent on foot but a nightmare for drivers to locate the one & only narrow & confusing entrance to the villa. The exits are easy though. Just a mere 5 mins walk would take you to Seminyak Square & there are plenty of food choices all around. Breakfast by the villa is pretty good for 2 days (as we have used up all the selections) but lots of other options just by walking outside to Seminyak area. Overall, my family enjoyed this experience.      ",

Only fault is rooms are joining so limited privacy. Main room is awesome with great smart TV, WiFi was also good and surround music via BT was good. We didn't like the electronic curtains or lights as hit and miss but not a big deal. Main room is massive with beautiful big slide doors opening onto the pool (unfortunately cant lock any of the villa). Breakfast was great and huge, plenty if choices.\nThe staff on the entire property were so great, we were made to feel very welcome.\nSpa service in room is great, we all had one. Room service was also very nice. Lounges and bed had some stains but overall clean\nI highly recommend the villa for a very relaxing holiday close to all restaurants in Seminyak.",

Dreamland is an extrordinary on-site experience in location, facilities, and aspect. Our 3 level 4 bedroom  villa was huge (believe the promo material) with large pool overlooking the  ocean. While in room dining was available we took advantage of nearby restaurants. It is to be noted that a vehicle is needed to take advantage of the areas facilities.\nOur Club villa in Seminyak was awesome. Location is very central, quiet, very easy walk to eateries, beach, etc. The villa itself is something else ... beautifully presented, very large rooms, private pool, each bedroom with en-suite, enclosed and secure yard. We were lucky to have also experienced the Presidential villa which offers the same as the Club villa plus billiard room, well equipped gym, much larger garden area, which would be an ideal stay for group bookings.\nALL staff are unbelievably accommodating with all requests being acted promptly and efficiently.\nIt is evident that C151 offers an exceptional experience.\n\n",

The chef catered for our allergies and served delicious food for him. Very friendly and hospital staff who always helped us with a smile on their face. The hotel also helped us arranging a good guide and driver to explore Bali. Our villa was situated very central with shops and restaurants around the corner but no noice from traffic or night life reached us. The beach was reachable within 5 min walking. ",

They also don't have terms & conditions and took extra money for a night we didn't stay at and showed us a made up printed out (not on website anywhere) of a fake terms and conditions. To date they have ignored our emails regarding the refund of this payment. It is a nice villa ok service when we stayed there, everything was good up until they have taken payments from our account and are not attending to our query so now I question the integrity of the business. In total they have taken almost $600 AUD and its been over a month and yet no resolution or response. I would suggest do not book this villa through ANY websites at all, if you really want to stay here I suggest you pay cash when you get there to avoid any unauthorised transactions being taken. We have never had any issues with any villas in Bali until staying here.",

You are paying for the electronic curtains and modern features but this wouldn't attract me to come back. Breakfast is horrible, if you want pancakes you have to pay extra, oatmeal porridge is US5 extra, this morning there was rat droppings within the breakfast and something crawling around in the muesli, it put us off eating here straight away. We will eat out from now on.\nIt is our third day stay here and we have no hot water. \nThe safe doesn't lock, you can't lock the rooms when you go out, we were told it's ok not to lock because it's safe (really !)\nBed in third room is supposed to be massage bed, doesn't work.\nAir cons fan doesn't turn down or up, stuck on one speed.\nPool isn't completely in sun.\nFree wifi however if you put your device down for 1 minute it logs you out !\n not worth the money. If I had my chance again I would not have stayed here. A lot of the villas are under construction.\nOnly thing going for it is the location, close to eat street and Seminyak square.",

              "text": "Lots happening now at C151, repairing / remodelling these luxury villas. Looks like the earlier comments which had made me think twice before booking here are soon gonna be irrelevant.\n\nI had paid for a C151 one bedroom pool villa for the location, privacy and layout which would give me a large enough pool to swim and a place to sunbathe throughout the day. (Many villas in the area seemed to offer only small glimpses of sky. On arrival we were given a special villa: the garden was bigger than I had expected from the description and photos. This upgrade included an outdoor jacuzzi, some pretty flowering trees, a private gym and snooker room.  While we didn't need these, the extra space gave a rather sumptuous feeling to our visit.\n\nThe staff were all friendly, helpful and efficient. I asked by email for a blender to make smoothies before we arrived. I was happy to receive a reply saying one would be provided (decent quality too!). The reception staff were warm and friendly, especially Aiyu. They realised quickly how poor my time management is and found ways to offer polite reminders to help us be ready for the occasional tours which they organised for us. Sending a fruit juice over is much nicer than asking \"are you gonna be on time for your taxi' - skilfully done guys!\n\nAnyway, on arrival, the butler showed us around the features of the villa and gave us the customary welcome drink. He made sure we knew how to customise the breakfast order to our liking. \n\nThe many remote control handsets (sound, light, curtains, TV, aircon) in each room are kept in a smart velvet folder: great idea I  have never seen before - hid the clutter you find on most coffee tables!\n \nWhile at C151 we connected our phones to the main amp which allowed us to select where we're listened to Spotify and podcasts, we especially loved being secluded enough to play the music pretty loud in the garden while messing about in the pool. ( the staff assured us that nobody could hear it in the vicinity)\nMy one concern was that the in room safe was too small to store my computer.  I left the computer hooked up to the TV (brought my own hdmi from home) while we were out and was happy to find it was safe and that housekeeping staff had left our valuables and taken away only the mess we leave in our wake each day! \n\nWish we could take all this back to Taiwan: the amazing local beach, excellent organic food shop, good restaurants just a gentle stroll away. Thanks to everyone for making our first trip to Bali a most memorable and relaxed one.\n\n",

Used to stay here on 2012ish and it was awesome. \n\nAs of 2016, this place has become a poorly maintained villa with serious repair works needed to be done here and there. Its supposedly a 5 star villa accommodation but really nothing to shown for. Its in a terrible condition.\n\nHere are my complaints:\n\n1. The toilet was broken 4 times on one of the rooms. Complained 4 times and still have the same issue and worst of all the toilet ended up not being able to flush anything. Of the 4 complaints the maintenance guy simply say \"oh this is our standard\" and call him up again if its not working. Are you kidding me seriously???\n\n2. The water literally smells and taste bad. Complained to the reception and the maintenance department and AGAIN simply told \"this is our standard cause we're near the beach\". Its a joke really since i've stayed at other hotels/villa near the vicinity and not having this issue. Its embarrassing to see the villa's standard has stoop so low. \n\n3. Overall maintenance. Simply put some of the rooms especially the bathroom simply needs refurbishment. The state of the materials has clearly been worn. Cigarette marks are on the floor/sink/jacuzzi/table you name it. Seriously you won't get this kind of facility and treatment from a \"5 star\" villa.\n\nSuch a shame. The location is awesome, one of the best but clearly it has been a shadow of its former self...\n\nRegards,\nArdion ",

As we had our own driver, it was not a problem. Sometimes we took a local taxi then we had to explain them and show the way. \nThe villa is very spacious. Living room and the bedroom even the pool is a big size! \nIt would be perfect for the friends and family. \nTheir service is also great. Overall, our experience during holiday was all good! \nThe only thing I would need to highlight is quality of breakfast. \nEgg was fine as everywhere else is. I am a little disappointed at the low quality of jams and the sausages for American Breakfast. And the fruit juice is not kind of fresh juice. \nThe food there is way too much like a local style I guess. \nAnyway, the villa has well equipped kitchen area so if you want to cook there is no problem during the stay! \nThanks for the sevice :) we had a good time!! \n\n",

              "text": "C151 Smart Villas has so much potential to be MORE...\n\nI usually would list the pro's before con's but in this case, C151 just did not impress me for how much i paid. Yup its all cool and stuff that its a smart villa, but cool enough to be a smart museum not 2 nights stay..\n\nCons:\n1. When we reached the villa the checkin took too long. \n2. The Villa was not maintained well, it was old furnishing and worn out\n3. it was HOT. The living room is a massive area with two AC's out of which only one worked, the other one would never turn on unless we called someone to come help us who went to the back of the villa to play with the wires for it to come on. which still was too hot. \n4. If we thought the living area was hot, out of 3 rooms, only one was cool enough that we did not sweat under the covers. \n5. The water tasted ODD- shower was salty, dispenser dint seem to clean. \n6. They charged us for Mineral water in the fridge\n7. We went to the Lobby one night at around 2AM, to find it SHUT. no one to help us locate our driver who was going to drive us up north for sight seeing. \n8. Very unhelpful reception staff\n9. They did not clean the rooms and are while we were gone\n10. The room service food: 1 out of 3 LOCAL dishes tasted good. and breakfast was not impressive\n\nPros:\n1. Surround sound music system\n2. Nice size pool with different coloured lights inside - makes it fun\n3. Full kitchen\n4. Nice service staff who came to the villa on call\n5. great massage but overpriced \n6. Absolutely amazing location, walking distance out to close by shopping, markets and restaurants. Also easy to find and go to places from... \n7. for what it's worth, the toilet's were clean and had a great 'smart system'\n8. Buggy service incase you have adults that prefer not to walk too much \n9. Very spacious: Big bathrooms, big living room, big pool, big everything. \n10. We got put into a 3 bedroom even though we booked a 2 bedroom. but have this- they LOCKED the third room. lol, so much for a upgrade? maybe if they opened up the third room we could have tested another AC for them not to get this review..",

But just for this one. I am making an exception in the hope to help people wasting their hard earned money to this place. \n\nUpon arrival there was no one even trying to help me get suitcases inside the villa. Once I dragged my stuff inside we briefly walked around to find out that is was just disgusting. Foot prints for the previous visitors were all over the place and walls were molded, the rooms smelled like smoke etc. they couldn't give us a new villa because the place was fully booked.\n\nTry to talk to the manager but he was nowhere to be found because he was on holiday and would return the last day of my stay.\n\nAnyway asked them to clean they villa again but took them ages before they started to clean.\n\nEvery towel in the Villa smelled like a sweaty sock of all the 4 bathrooms in the house.\n\nAll the \"smartness\" of this villa are not so smart anymore and far outdated!\n\nThe showers and bad tubs were badly maintained.\n\nDuring the BBQ there was noone that assisted at the table.\n\nThe last day during check out the manager came to settle the bill where he and his staff listed things on the list which were clearly not been consumed at all and almost got charged 12 million rp for nothing.\n\nIt didn't matter what we said but the manager didn't seem to understand that we were beyond disappointed in the place.  \n\nBottom line is this place has very bad management and I believe with the right management it could live up to its full potential.\n\nHowever the people do not care about their customers and customers are continually being asked to understand their lack of competence.\n\nBut for +900 usd a night customers shouldn't be educating what they pay for.",

              "text": "I wish I had taken into consideration the bad reviews before booking this villa. Location is amazing but the villa is very poorly maintained and managed. Considering the price they ask this is not acceptable. The whole villa was smelling mold & cigarettes, it was like sleeping in a huge ashtray. The towels were dirty as the floor and everything in the villa. The material they used are not appropriate in front of the ocean and need to be changed. I agree with the review saying they should close and refurbish. They might have security problems one day, specially in the stairs going to the beach.The staff was nice and motivated but I guess they were told to charge everything including water. They only provide us 2 small bottles of water for our whole stay (3 days) making us pay extra water. That reflects the state of mind of the owners. Also we had the same problem with the orange juice. Freshly made for us the first day, it was replaced by a chemical potion the other days. It could be a paradise because of the location and the kind staff but only after they refurbish, replace their electronics which is not smart and learn them to clean like in a 5* hotel or luxury villa.",

The rooms were equipped with high quality sound systems, great wifi. 2 bathroom had built-in jacuzzi while the other had steamroom installed in the shower.

Only problem was that the pool water kept on coming into the living area and the third bedroom. Other than that, I would call it an amazing villa, totally gonna build my dream home that way (and probably set the pool a little farther with proper drainage). Another amazing thing about the location is that on one side you have the beach (with surfing lessons yay!) and on the other side, it is kind of set in a shopping district, where you have really cool silver jewelery shops and other shops like Accessorize and supermarkets as well, in case you ever need to cook in that fabulous kitchen of the villa! You have massage and tattoo places as well. We made pizza in the kitchen one day, and it is really well stocked and the fridge is well stocked too. The staff is amazing, they were so kind and helpful. Prompt for villa service and everything.",

It is right next to KuDeTa, which is a great beach, well worth a visit. The pool in our villa was great and the fully equipped kitchen was very helpful. The only problem was that there were not many renatable villas, so it is quite hard to get into. Other than that I loved it.",

Unfortuantely we rebooked this year before looking at TripAdvisor again and seeing all of the recent reviews. \nThe moment we got to the Villas we felt something wasnt right - our greeting was cold and nothing special. The staff that took us to our villa were nice and trying their best, but you could tell they had lost a lot of enthusiasm. We then asked the staff and they said only 7 of the villas were still open due to the legal battle going on - which we later read about on trip adivisor. There were only a few staff manning the villas hence the lack of service.\n\nThe list of issues began to pile from day one:\n\nWhen we got to our villa, our fridge had not been stocked up, there were bugs inside, the air conditioning would cool down the main lounge and kitchen room. The pool and furniture seemed under maintained since last visit, we had burn holes in the couches and rust on the seats.\n\nOne morning when I was sleeping in, Reception rang through to the bedroom at 8am and woke me up, when I answered they said 'one moment please' and then transferred me a cold caller marketing call trying to sell me something. I rang back reception to complain and to ask why the call was sent through and where it came from, I was told I would be called back - never heard anything.\n\nWhen we went to check out, we were given a ridiculous bill which we hadn't even made! They were trying to charge us for the items that were missing from the mini bar when we checked in plus other items we had no idea about. The check out took a long time as he had to call his managers etc to get the bill sorted.\n\nWe were then told that the 'holding fee' that is placed at the beginning of your stay would take 2 weeks to go back onto our credit card - which is ridiculous as all other hotels released the remaining costs immediately, plus we were not told this when putting the costs down.\n\nThe staff member who we checked out with couldn't care less about our complaints and did nothing in the way of apologizing or trying to make up for the fact that we payed $500 per night for a 2 star stay and service, let alone all of the hassle and issues we incurred!\n\nAbsolutely horrendous. Do not stay here. It is not worth it. A year ago I would have recommended this place to anyone, now I wouldn't suggest it at all.",

No iPhone (iDevice) players. I would have expected AppleTV.  There's an oven but no microwave oven. \n\nWorse, the smart toilet smells of year-old urine. I called housekeeping to clean but the stench remains.\n\nI do not recommend this place.",

We left for lunch and when we returned found all the owners of about 8 villas with police and solicitors approaching guests and asking them to leave.  Apparently the C151 had rented the rooms and had not reimbursed the owners of the villas!  We wasted a whole day whilst waiting in the lobby with our luggage, waiting for staff to book another room elsewhere!  They wanted to put us in a villa in the middle of nowhere and we had to insist on something closer as this is why we had stayed there to begin with.\nThe Staff at C151 who had to deal with the drama were not aware of what was happening and I truly felt for them.  Not the best way to end your holiday!  Every other villa that we stayed at was fabulous and a wonderful experience.",

On the second day of our four day stay, as we left the villas, we noticed that a notice (attached in photos) warned us that despite having paid, by court order we were unable to re-enter the villa.\nWe went for lunch not really understanding what was happening and on return found the complex swarming with police and some of the owners of the villas.  The owners were polite and courteous and expressed regret that we had been caught up in a dispute between them and the management company.  There were however other heavies around who I personally found extremely intimidating.  \nAs can be imagined the whole situation was somewhat chaotic and quite frightening.  Staff did the best they could.  We were unable to talk to anyone in management.  We asked if we could stay on for the days we had paid for but were left in no doubt that we needed to pack up and get out. The heavies wedged open the doors of one of the villas and appeared to be partying.\n\nFrankly if I had been told that in Bali, it was possible to evict guests who had paid for accommodation I would not have believed it.",

We just went back last week to re look at them as we couldn't get in this trip due to them being booked out and the staff were appalling-we did email them first to make a booking to view a Vila and they never responded so we went there and they ignored us for 30 mins then told us to come back the next day. The following day we returned to be ignored for 15 mins and then taken through. Needless to say the villas are now run down and not looked after. The grounds used to be immaculate which you would expect at 1500 per night but they have been badly neglected and are looking very tired and need a paint badly. Glad we made the effort or we would be very disappointed if we committed to that price and got that in return.",

We were vegetarian and they daily served excellent breakfast hot and delicious of our choice. They went extra mile to make our stay memorable. All smart devices in villa worked.  Pool was really really good and was well kept.  Only problem was little ants that were in Kitchen.  They tried everything to get rid of them and they did not bother us most of the time.  The location is excellent and best thing is it is adjoining KUDETA the best restaurant in Bali.  Highly appreciated.",

The pool was warm,loved all the smart features, TVs everywhere , ice machine in the huge fridge,spa baths, theatre room, the list goes on .The staff were great breakfast in the villa was good. The location was perfect ,next to Ku De Ta & very close to the beach. The only negative thing is the villa needs a lick of paint ..   I will be going again next year! We stayed in villa 5.

I don't believe I ever thought that you could have too much technology but these villas have too many things to go wrong and obviously nobody able to fix them.  Jacuzzi bath didn't work.  Kept getting electrocuted by the massage bed !!! And we were bitten to death by Bali creepy crawlies.  The electrics would give any British building inspector a heart attack !!\nWe paid full price and so expected a lot for the money we were paying but were disappointed. We ended up leaving early and going back to Singapore and management refused any sort of refund on the 7 remaining nights we had already paid.\nOn the plus side the service was excellent and staff very helpful.",

              "text": "Definitely one of our best stays ever! \nWe have been the first guest at the new villas, so we got a special welcome ceremony which was really great! \nThe location is amazing as well as the service. The staff was very attentive, friendly and obliging. They took care of us and fulfilled every wish we had. \nThe villa is very modern and nice. There is enough space for 6-8 guests. \nUnfortunately the villa had a few little problems cause as mentioned no one stayed there before . Im sure these little problems will be fixed very quick also because the general manager was very interested to our feedback and already assigned the staff to solve these things. By the way, the GM was very open to our critics and was very cooperative.\nFinally we definitely recommend this place to spend unforgettable holidays.",

We booked this last minute as it was impromptu and consequently got a great deal as we needed the three bed villa.  We were travelling with my partners mother and his two children.  Breakfast was good (not great) and the rooms were spacious and each had its own bathroom ensuite which was good.  There was a good living area that could be closed off and kept cool, and the pool was a great size.  However, I would point out that the 'Smart' bit of the villa is a bit too smart!  You needed a 'How To' guide to work the spa bath and the toilets were a scream!  There were no notes on the light switches (all together in the lounge room) so you frequently turned off someone elses lights or turned ON their sound system.  Also, the pool area was extremely slippery when wet (we kept putting towels down) and the doors to the rooms were very heavy to handle. If you had the lounge area open then the pool water would splash in as it was very close. Look, it was a great location - next to Seminyak Square and close to all the action, but it is an expensive option for gadgets that you probably won't appreciate! Probably wouldn't stay again.",

              "text": "The location is cool but the concept is a bit pretentious : too much electronics is spoiling the recipe. It's a fantastic location at one step from Oberoi, Kudeta and walking distance to the beach (even with young children). However the lobby's communal swimming pool is a no man's land giving an awkward first impression of the resort. (Dismantled daybeds laying all around the pool during our stay.)\n\nThe service leaves mixed feelings. On our check-in even though we have already payed half of our stay, the receptionist focussed on cashing-in the second half of our rental and did not show much consideration for any other matters. Generally speaking the staff members are trying to be helpful but lack training.\n+\nLocation, location, location\nThe room service (plus the daily breakfast delivered to the villa) were very good.\u2028\nThe compound is quiet even though the are in a busy area.\nOverall, I would  recommend them first   to give to the communal pool   a major cleaning in order to reflect the villas'quality.\nI would probably come back.",

Staff were very friendly and helpful, and our only complaint was we had to come home.  There is a small market out the front, and it's next to the Oberoi and KuDeTah with a small walk to some of the great restaurants.",

The private swimming pool was great and music played in the living room was also playing through speakers in the pool, the terrace, the bedroom and the bathroom.  We stayed there for 5 days and definitely would consider going there next time we go to Bali. \n\nThe location is handy to the shops and restraurants in Seminyak too. \n\nThe staff were friendly but sometimes the service was variable. On two of the three mornings that we asked for a wake up call we didn't get it and the front desk was not very useful in identifying restaurants or local services - they tried hard but did not seem very knowledgeable. \n\nThe room was very high tech with all lighting, air con and curtains handled through remote control but some of the basics were less well done. The bath was supposed to be like an infinity pool where the water drained away but you had to get in slowly or the drains were overwhelmed and the bathroom flooded. We gave up trying to get the plug to pop back up so we could not get water back out afterwards.",

The ride to the hotel was about 25 min. I was not expecting to find such a luxurious villa in Bali. I did some research on-line b4 making a booking and the pix did not disappoint. The villa was stunning and huge. My kids (2) each had a room and so did my husband and I. Plus a full kitchen, not that we did any cooking. And we had our own private pool. The villa was immaculate, the beds were comfy, and all the electronic ammenities (my kids loved playing with the toilet, you have to go to know what I'm talking about). And again more air conditioning. Bali is HOT - so it was nice to go out for a day and come back to an air conditioned room. The staff was so kind and attentive. They helped with making a booking for my daughter and me to go horse back riding at Umalas stables (also highly recommend this). Room service was great, fresh juice and fruit in the mornings, what a treat. Dinner service was a bit slow, but we usually went out for dinner. There are so many restaurants within walking distance and a great spot for sunset drinks right next door, KuDeTa. Also within walking distance is Seminyak beach and a new shopping center, Seminyak Square, but some of the shops were still vacant. But a short taxi ride along Jalan Oberoi and you'll find plenty of shops. I'm sure I'm leaving out tons of other things I loved about this hotel, but just go and you'll love it too.",

Upon arriving very late in the early hours of the morning the staff were Brilliant. The service was impeccable, The Villas were impeccable and we all felt like we were totally spoilt. Nothing is ever to much trouble at C151 Villas. We traveled with a group of 6 including 4 (20 year) girls. They all had a great time. I would highly recommend these Villas to everyone. We felt very safe and secure. The pool is awesome and the Day Beds ......... well lets say that once your on them you just don't ever want to leave. We had in Villa massages and a BBQ night, again all exceptional. We stayed in a 3 bedroom Villa, awesome, and if you love gadgets, you will love these villas, its have everything from TVs in the bathrooms to electric self flushing toilets hahaha. What more could you ask for !!!!!!\nWe highly recommend the Villas and will definitely being staying at the Villas again.\n\nFamily From Western Australia",

The location is excellent, two minutes from Ku De Ta bar one way, and the shops and restaurants of Siminyak the other.\n\nThe Villas themselves are very private (entry is through a sliding door, controlled by the credit card style key) and stylishly (and Western) design. Nothing seems to have been spared, apart maybe from longevity. I agree with the last poster that the villa seem a bit badly built at times, but if you report a problem to housekeeping we found them round like a shot to sort out all problems.\n\nTried the room service (plus the daily breakfast delivered to the villa) and in room massage and both were very good.\nOverall, I would thoroughly recomment this place, and am surprised it is not higher up the list",

I truly enjoyed taking multiple swims in the pool daily - big enough to swim in properly - as well as the excellent massages. Walking to the Ku de Ta restaurant/club - essentially you need not ever leave this bubble.. A stressed out business traveler on a 3 day sojourn I returned relaxed and refreshed.",

              "text": "We stayed at these villas by default as we were upgraded from a resort in Kuta due to lack of rooms.  I found the staff at C151 to be friendly and helpful and their presentation was always of a high standard. The rooms are very well equiped with up-to-date technology. (There are enough remotes to satisfy anyone.) You can utilise fingerprint activated safes in the bedrooms, the flat screen TVs, 9 throughout, and the 3 spas and 1 sauna. The Pool was kept in immaculate condition and there was plenty of seating. We had a 2 room villa and there were 4 single lounges with seating to accommodate a further 4-6. Housekeeping staff were efficiency personified.Breakfast was wonderful, although I've yet to taste great bacon in Bali.\nOverall, C151 was a resort that I will try to experience again.\nThe only real downside was that due to the opaque glass walls surrounding our villa, we found that we became isolated. The only contact we had with other people was when we ventured out into Seminyak or Kuta. For me this was a bit of a problem, but, for a lot of others, this would be a huge bonus.",

Overall we really liked C151 - but only at the discounted price (unless there are 6 of you where it would be worthwhile - except there are only 2 pool loungers per vills).\n\nVery friendly staff and proactive service,  The technology is in fact a bit overhyped - and does not always function how it should.  Also very slow wifi compared with most other places.\n\nVery convenient and close to the best of everything.\n\nWhat we liked most:\n- very clean\n- good bed\n- great stereo and pool\n- location.\n\nAreas for improvement:\n- staff calling after 9pm about an admin issue\n- the pool self-drained 1/3 of its contents day 1\n- the touch open safes take like 30 goes to open\n- could do with a Buddha's head or two in the garden.\n\nNot The Legian or Como - but close.",

              "text": "Let me start off by saying that I am a pretty particular individual when it comes to my travel accommodations and I like things to be nice, clean, and well maintained.  I expect things to be as advertised .  I am quite happy to pay for what I want but then do expect things to be as they say they are.  \n\nWe arrived at the resort really late so there was just security staff available when we checked in but despite a bit of a language barrier, everything went well and they got us into our villa quickly so we could go to bed.  They took us to our villa with our luggage on a golf cart which was nice as it was a bit of a distance from the lobby.  Unfortunately the route to the villa is quite dark and on evenings out for dinner, I would have definitely felt more comfortable with a more well lit walkway.  \n\nWe had received notice that a driver would meet us at the airport and take us back to the hotel but we never found him and had to rent a cab which was about 200,000 (approx 20.00 CAD).   I won't lie, this frustrated me because, we thought we had our transportation lined up and at midnight, I didn't want to be hanging around the airport looking for our driver and being repeatedly approached by taxi drivers looking to take us to where we wanted to go.   Due to the language barrier, we never really did find out what happened to our driver or why he wasn't at the airport when we landed.  \n\nThe villa we stayed in was beautiful and in its day, was probably fabulous but you could definitely see some of the wear and tear from years of use.  The drapes in both the bedroom and living rooms open and close by remote and the glass doors open so that the whole room becomes an extension of the pool area.  It was so hot that we kept the doors closed to keep in cool in the the living area.  The blinds in the living room didn't work but that may have just been a dead battery in the remote.  Honestly, we didn't even mention it to the staff, as the drapes were opened enough for our liking.  It has a beautiful stereo system that goes throughout the villa and pool.  It was really nice having the music going while sitting out at the pool.   The rain shower was the best I'd ever used.   The pool was amazing and huge.    It was well used as the weather was so hot and humid. The villa is well lit and lots of lights around the pool which is nice when coming back from a late dinner.  We were able to lock the gate coming into the villa and it was completely private once inside the compound area.  \n\n The staff came early the next morning with breakfast which was so nice as we hadn't had a chance to order due to coming in so late the night before.  They set it up at our table for us and make us fresh Bali coffee.  It was delicious and so nice to have breakfast in our own space in your pyjamas as opposed to having to get up and go somewhere during a scheduled timeframe.    We were able to assign a time for it to be delivered (if we wanted to sleep late or get and early start) and it was right on time every time, piping hot and fresh.  There was a large water cooler in our kitchen which has hot and cold setting for drinking and coffee.  There is bottled water as well in the bathrooms for drinking and brushing teeth. \n\nThe staff at this resort is absolutely incredible.  So hard working and gracious and so willing to help with any request.   Quick, efficient and so willing to please.  They came quickly when we asked for something, kept everything clean and tidy and kept us well stocked with clean dry towels.  They came everyday to clean our villa and the pool and otherwise left us to ourselves unless we needed them.  Breakfast was brought to our villa every morning and each day we filled out a order form for the next morning.  They had a large room service menu as well.\n\nRestaurants and shops were literally right around the corner from our villa and we never had to walk very far to find amazing food for supper.  \n\nOur checkout was smooth and easy and they called us a taxi to take us to Obud.  \n\nOverall Impression: My  first impression was that I was a little underwhelmed.  It is not the grand resort entrance that I have come to expect in places like Mexico or the Dominican Republic.   The villa is clean but is dated and could use some minor upgrades and  maintenance.  Generally just basic minor stuff which really didn't affect our stay in any way.  The pathway to our villa was dark and really could use more lighting.  \n\nThe staff are truly one of the best parts of this place.  Warm, friendly and so attentive despite some minor issues with the different languages.  \n\nI would have liked to have some sort of a resort guide to refer to as far as how to get ahold of the desk, breakfast routines, spa services etc as well as a listing of some of the villa features.  I think it would have been helpful.  \n\n I would stay here again and hopefully one day can return.  Being from Canada, I found the incredibly high humidity a bit of a challenge and would maybe want to revisit Bali again in the dry season.  The accommodations though were amazing and we were very happy with our stay.  We were able to rest and relax by the pool and go out for nice dinners in the evenings which is what we wanted.  \n\n",

Today while inside our villa during heavy rain we saw the gates open and shut on their own and anyone could have walked in if we hadn't been home. In the evening we tried to get in and the gates wouldn't accept the code. It was pouring with rain and so one person had to scale the fence to get in. With no-one in the office to let us in, there was no alternative. This is something they need to sort out because it is not great to be locked out in the rain.",

It is a bit run down with visible wears and tears everywhere and needs some serious upgrades. 2 toilets are usable (howere they used to be electronic and fansy).\nThe villa is huge, well equipped, only steps away from reasonably priced eateries and beach. Staffs are nice and polite. They respond to request quickly. Breakfast is nicely served in villa but lacks of variety. Beds are huge and comfortable. Pool is nice especially for kids. Suggest to include manual lock function at the front gate as I don't feel secured knowing that the gate can be opened by staffs (although I know they are professional). I will still it consider value for money and recommend it. I hope to return in future seeing it in better shape.",

The property itself is definitely needing some maintenance, but that didn't bother us. The location and space more than made up for it. COVID has meant that not all villas are open. Staff were super friendly and helpful, we would definitely stay again.",

              "text": "We studied a number of reviews before planning the holidays, so we thought that the website pictures were not up to date for sure; but we decided to book early because of the big pool and the position near the center of Seminyak and the beach clubs, and finally the big discount for the advanced booking. In fact, the villa needs some refit, as pointed out by many reviews, but it is just in terms of finishing because everything goes well in every furniture and installation. Despite this, the villa is large and well-furnished as described in the plans. But we said \u201cwonderful august\u201d because the workers and the employer made the difference. A lot of difference! They are so kind and effective 24/24, so they turned our good stay in an excellent way. Starting from the breakfast, absolutely plenty of food and delicious, all the people are ready to comply any needs of the customers. Everything you need, you have just to ask. The regular services are excellent and also the extra-charge ones. What a team! Congratulations!!!\n\n",

We were on half board so mostly had breakfast and dinner at the villa, food could be a bit hit and miss and not very hot although most meals were substantial. \nAs many others have said, there has been very little maintenance carried out for some time. Doors are warped and either very difficult or impossible to lock, dining chairs are worn or split and lounges are worn and stained.\nOur bath towels were good quality and fairly new, pool towels had to be requested but were also good quality, bath robes were not provided as advertised, although we did not specifically request them so they may have been available.\nOddly, there were no bedside lights in either bedroom.\nMicrowaves would be very helpful, particularly if you are staying with children.\nPool is huge, again much maintenance is needed but the water was very clean and it's great to have a private pool.\nAs long as you don't expect perfection, C151 is a convenient and comfortable place to stay.",

Let me start by saying the staff did what they could to rectify issues, there was no manager on site, however I feel its important for travellers to have their expectations clear, hence my review is detailed as they could be suitable for some. These villas are very old and not maintained. The communal pool is derelict and mouldy (they were trying to scrub it with bleach) and the communal bar area is not usable and held up with acro props.Breakfast was poor, edible but we chose to eat out after one morning of it. Dining chairs were gross.Our pool filter was so loud it was removed completely after the first day as we couldn't sleep and it was going all night.Apparantly broken. The pool light was hanging off but was fixed after the first day.None of the doors to the villas locked, including the living room and all bedrooms that opened up to the pool. Was fixed the first day but the same problem occurred again that night. The couches were stained,covered in cigarette burns , other furniture stained, scratched and in desperate need of an update. Safe in our room didn't work so we given a master key to utilise. Literally No shower pressure(it was a trickle) Towels and sheets need replacing.In the end we gave up asking for things to be fixed, cut our losses and moved to another property after day 2 (we still had 6 nights left in Bali).Pros:location and size.Cons:dirty/dusty/old/unsafe/Technology that doest work and is no longer relevant.",

They went out of their way to assist and respond to every request. The Villas are huge with ample space and privacy right in the heart of Seminyak. Once you are here you can walk to everything, beaches, shopping, restaurants and markets are all just outside your private Villa. We had a family of five and the kids absolutely loved the pool and the spa baths as well as the sound system where they could dance or swim with their own music and plenty of space. \n\nPros- Location-Privacy-Space-Staff-Spa-Kitchen-Daily clean\n\nCons-Weathered-Towels-Maintenance\n\nSuggestions: Please get a microwave for the kitchens and replace ALL towels.",

And the water is yellow and towels were not very clean. The mattress is a little worn out and not so comfortable to sleep. We stayed for 4days .. the breakfast was okay , same menu but at least got few choices to choose everyday. There were TVs in living room , toilet and the bath tub which is cool. Overall okay , just need a little improvement I guess , the service and workers are nice and pleasant ... may or may not return \ud83d\ude04",

              "text": "The photos on their website are deceiving - on first impressions you are wowed by the size of the villas but then you get a closer look and realise that this facility does not care about its guests or the environment they are staying in. The pool if full of mould, sinks not cleaned properly and the build up of grime around the taps is disgusting, dont put a towel on the floor as the floors are so dirty they will come up grey. Benches are not wiped down properly and there are stains on all the furniture. Be careful of the mini bar as they do not provide you with a list and when you ask for one half of what is listed in not actually in the villa. You will receive phone calls every morning from the front reception telling you there is someone on the phone for you about a booking you have made, when you tell them you dont have a booking anywhere they put the call through anyway and you get a delighted person on the other end of the phone telling you that they have exciting news for you (I wonder if the villa gets some sort of kick back for these calls), needless to say they are extremely annoying and the reception staff should know better. Automatic door opens by itself when you are not near it which limits privacy. Front reception area is a mess and in desperate need of renovation. 7 days in a row our place mats for breakfast were just put back in the draw and never cleaned, we eventually cleaned them ourselves as they were so dirty and sticky. Pool never cleaned and the filth and mould just increased in it daily. I read about there being a room service menu but there is not one available. Technology such as lights, surround sound and curtains is very hit and miss and frequently doesnt work.Things like coffee are not refilled and neither is cutlery and cups, they are just taken away and you have to ring to get a teaspoon sent back up. These Villas were probably once 5 star but are now maybe 3. The location is good - one of the few positives I have found. At the price we have paid there are much better value for money places out there so dont waste your money.",

              "text": "We first stayed here a few years ago when the land next door was still a rice field, so this  is our second stay. Booked last minute through Agoda and got a great price for a 3br villa. Checked in late at 10pm and was soon ushered by buggy to the 3br villa not far from the lobby.\n\nNice surprise that we got a newly renovated villa No.9 as apparently they\u2019re undergoing renovations for all the villas. Everything in the villa was in good working condition, clean and well maintained. \n\nPlus: \n- Good prices for private villa\n- Excellent location: between Seminyak Square and Ku De Ta.\n- Large villa,large pool (1.6m)\n- Attentive staff: receptive to guests requests\n- Full kitchen: new refrigerators\n- Newly renovated villas: new paint, new wood floor coating\n- Good breakfast\n- Hardly any mosquitoes or flies\n- Good soundsystem (Bose speakers)\n\nMinus: \n- Too much chlorine in the pool\n- Strong urine odor in toilet\n- Toilet bowl needs water spray to help with cleaning\n- Old towels\n- No parking\n- Low security presence\n- Dark alleyways\n\nHaving said all of the above, the area is safe to walk around by yourself as there\u2019s lots of tourists out and about and we felt very comfortable in the villa itself... we\u2019d love to come back again... :)",

              "text": "Our trip to C151 Smart villas was so disappointing. After booking our holiday, we decided to upgrade to the 'so called' presidential suite as a special treat for our friends. \n\nThe villas were dirty, the butler service was less than average and many of the items listed as part of the villa were not included. The water in one apartment was cold, there were spiders and spider webs in the shower, the cleanliness of the kitchen was disgusting. The whole place is aged and run down. \n\nWhen asking for an iron and ironing board, we were advised there were none available in the complex. When an iron finally arrived, the cord was frayed and too dangerous to use. There were no robes in the bathrooms, there were no coat hangers, the bedheads in the rooms were grubby. We attempted room service and the staff did not understand our request. \n\nWhen we went to get into bed in one of the apartments, there were bugs in the bed. The one and only meal we had delivered was breakfast, which was simply inedible. \n\nWe were so disgusted with the cleanliness of the villas and the service provided that we left after one night.\n\nWe did raise our concerns on the evening we arrived and we were advised that these issues were all rectified. This was not the case.\n\nback to villa later that day, I requested a meeting from the manager and I was advised that no one was available on that day. I left my phone number and advised I would return again. Between then and the next day I had no call, email or any contact from villa. Again, if I was paying $100 per night for a room then, I would expect this level of service but I wasn't I had paid in advance approx $1200 per night. \n\nWhen I returned again, I met the eCommerce manager and I have never been more disgusted in the level of client service in my life.\n\nDuring this meeting, the general/eCommerce manager was completely unprofessional and would not even acknowledge our concerns. He was outright rude, continually smirked at my comments and would not even look at me. He was not interested in anything, other than informing me that I was lying about the cleanliness of the villas. When I showed a photo of bugs in the bed., I was told I could have taken the photo anywhere. I was informed  that items such as robes, an iron, turndown services was available only on request. These were not standard - again I remind you, I am supposedly staying in a luxury villa.\n\nWhen I asked to go back through the villa and show him the issues we had with cleanliness, he advised that the villa had been rebooked for the nights we had already booked so we couldn't. \n\nHe also advised that even if we could,  he still wouldn't believe me that there was an issue. His villas had never had a complaint about cleanliness. short, he took no responsibility for his establishment or staff.\n\nI requested 2 of the 4 nights accomodation refunded (we only stayed one night) however we were flatly refused. \n\nWe were offered - 2 nights accomodation to be used at ANY TIME at EITHER of the C151 villas in Bali.  I was informed I would have this emailed to me however insisted on not leaving until I received a signed voucher. \n\nThe voucher arrived, which the terms of the voucher to be used 'before December 2017' and only for the C151 villas in Seminyak. This I disputed and finally one of his staff arrived with a non transferable voucher for valid 12 months. And I was accused of lying!!\n\nThese villas are NOT luxury. \n",

The very expensive presidential suite did not offer all that was expected -the smart concept had not been updated since construction I expect and was more of an annoyance than benefit, with no hot water, toilets not flushing and TV's not working. The Butler was no where to be found and when we asked for assistance there was no one would could help us or wanted to help us.Dead bugs in the bed where the final straw and we ended up leaving found somewhere else to stay. \nWhen we came back to discuss a part refund with the manager Yudha Pradipta he laughed at our complaints, and refused to assist us. \nAfter this experience I will be taking note of REVIEWS that our posted, before I ignored them thinking people just whining, but the utter disappointment has made me take the time to write this.\nI love Bali and all the the places I have previously stayed...you have many many choices..go find another, that is NOT THE C151 VILLAS...",

This included water on floor in toilet which needed to be mopped up each day; flickering light switch in bathroom which would not turn off and door handle stuck in with gaffa tape, certainly not 5 star qualities.  We booked through expedia which advertised the resort had its own fleet of vehicles, this was not the case they used taxi's off the street and then slugged us the far more than the going rate (also all charged in USA dollars??)  The staff although pleasant did not put effort to rectify any of the maintenance issues, bought to their attention during our 4 night stay. The villas did not appear to  been cleaned thoroughly and our villa (13) was certainly poorly maintained.",

The smart thing is about the curtain using remote control and also spacious living room. My kids can also said they don't want to go back to this villa, they feel it too. ",

              "text": "Shocking stay more than disappointing. We stayed in Bali for several weeks and intended to stay at a number of resorts including c151. This hotel is certainly not as advertised, starting with an underwhelming check in, being double billed on two separate credit cards after being told one didn't work, not only this but they collect full payment at check in something I am not accustomed to. I only realised when checking banking, when querying this the staff were not obliging in fixing the concern & I was short paid back a week later taking into account the charged exchange rate. This alone I could live with however this was the beginning.\n\nWe were booked for four nights at $600 odd per night, most technology features were problematic, a issue with the fridge not being connected for ice and then leaking, an air con unit failing to keep the media room under 27 degrees, sound system broken, cold water in the shower, problems with television reception plus several others. We endeavoured to be reasonable but at 600 usd per night this is a shocking experience needing technicians in your room constantly. This would not constitute 3 star in my opinion!\n\nAfter 24 hours and no improvement I contacted management given our issues and being on our honeymoon to suggest we wanted to check out and receive a refund for the un used portion of our stay, to my surprise they suggested they would not refund. After much stress and argument and hours later they agreed to refund and that it would be done within 24 hours.\n\nWeeks later and after discussions with my bank and the hotel eventually I received a refund in the meantime they had charged my card again, absolute disgrace and completely unscrupulous behaviour, to need to suggest legal action to receive a refund after having a signed document claiming the refund would be done is a joke. Stay clear folks!",

              "text": "I arrived 6th July for three-day stay. On the morning of 7th, notices from the courts appeared on the doors of many of the villas saying that they were not to be used, whether already paid for or not. Initially we ignored them, believing it was part of a long term legal process that would continue until after we had left. When we returned from lunch, the reception area was full of owners, police and some dubious-looking characters. \nOne of the owners, accompanied by his solicitor, explained that many of the owners had not been paid by for four years by the Canadian company managing the villas and that they had no alternative than to evict guests of the affected villas. We were obliged to pack immediately and vacate, despite having paid for two more nights.\nNo-one was on hand from the management company. Some guests, particularly those with children, were distressed at having to find alternative accommodation. To be fair, the hotel staff in reception despite, whilst no doubt fearing whether they would have jobs at the end of the day, did their best to find alternative accommodation. We quickly relocated to the Nyaman Villas, a short walk away, after checking that C151 would pay the bill in advance. This proved to be a blessing, as Nyaman was far superior in every way.",

Poorly maintained remotes for curtains & lights. Jacuzzi switches which don\u2019t work like they should. A wifi network that keeps rejecting your log-ins. TV channels set up for free-to-air broadcast of the World Cup but requiring a major reprogramming of channels (say, 30 minutes by the hotel's technician's estimate) to get back  pay-TV services for CNN, BBC etc although the flat-screen TVs had more than enough AV, HDMI, RF connectors for an easy flick of the switch, like my home TV has been set up to switch between free broadcast, pay-TV, Apple TV & other devices. \n\nSo much for the UN-smart features in this SMART villas. \n\nService was mediocre although the staff tried hard. Day 1 we had floor towels for tapping wet feet next to the shower, bath tub & toilet. Day 2 we were missing one towel. Day 3 was greeted with one miserable towel next to the bath tub. Similar neglects in other areas such as refills of your favourite tea bags \u2014 6 tea bags on day 1 dwindling down to 2 bags on day 3.\n\nBreakfast is another thorn. Always lukewarm; unappetising omelettes, dry-hard scrambled eggs, overcooked meat & sausages. Then there\u2019s the issue of sauces & condiments. Best to buy your own ketchup, chill sauce, salt, pepper & whatever else you may need.\n\nBut the most crucial failing of it all was the thoughtlessness which went into the glasses and eating utensils which were all breakable. Start with storage \u2014 6-inch tall champagne flutes stored vertically in 12-inch drawers which topple over, and may break, whenever that drawer is opened. 3-bedroom villas with private pools invite partying and families, yet all the drinking glasses, plates and bowls were all breakable. I can understand that \u201ctouch of class\u201d C151 may have set out to portray for the prices they're charging; but surely \u2014 had common sense and pragmatism prevailed \u2014 the designers and vendors could be prodded into coming up with that \u201ctouch of class\u201d while catering to partying and families with kids without fear of anyone tripping over that breakable glass or plate by the pool! Water, bare feet, broken glass etc. \u2014 they are all ingredients to a nightmare waiting to happen.",

Though there was a minor miscommunication with ordering inhouse food, after all the environment is quiet and ambience and very relaxing. Perfect to come in June/July where you can view stars in the sky at night by pool side.",

A brief run through the villa and left to fall straight to sleep! Every morning on time, breakfast of our choice would be served to us in our villa. Nothing too much trouble! We could not adjust the aircon in the bedroom and advised the staff, amazingly a brand new air con was installed within 2 hours! So much space , great kitchen ( only used to make lovely drinks) lovely spa and a huge pool! Really loved having the music set up available for iPod, iPhone, piped right through the villa. Very private, not overlooked at all! Towels and linen were abundant throughout or stay! Location, excellent! A two minute stroll to Ku De Ta and the Oberoi, Seminyak Square and the flea market. Very happy with our choice! The spa staff were really lovely and I can recommend it highly! Thank you to all the staff!",

Upon walking into our villa, we were awe struck as to how beautiful and trendy it is! \nBut, there are little details which kept bugging me...for instance, in the master shower stall, water leaks out of the bottom of the shower stall - the wood floor is heavily water stained indicating that this has been an older/ongoing issue. \nAlthough the pool is stunning, water falls out the side and tends to gather in front of the living room doors and stays there...not draining anywhere, causing a wet mess ;-( \nWe had to grab extra towels to put near there to dry it up and to prevent water from hitting the living room floor.\nThe kitchen/bathroom faucet handles and appliances show a lot of wear and tear which was surprising how more expensive this place is..\nThe in-house stereo receiver kept shorting out if you played music too loud...\nOne of the ceiling lights in the living room kept flickering on and off which was annoying....\nBut the service was amazing!\n\nAlthough I loved this place, these little details and others I did not mention surprised and bugged me considering how upscale this place is/attempts to be. \nThe location is great and the concept is amazing...I just wish the owners would keep the villas up with the image they are portraying....I would stay here again depending on asking price for that season!",

Super fast Internet, remote control windows drapes, lights speakers all over the villa areas and much more.  You even have a smart toilet with two TV's IN THE TOILET a lone.  This place is cracking. I loved it and certainly my referals will keep coming to you.",

Private pool was refreshing, kitchen and common area was equipped enough for what we needed- we had breakfast in the villa each morning but no major cooking. Service staff was always friendly, although a little slow at times. This is common in Bali... Excellent service, just at a slower pace. But, that's why we were in Bali! Villas are surrounded by shopping, restaurants, and around the corner from the beach! Excellent stay- would definitely recommend to friends!",

              "text": "The Location is exceptional but the bucks stops with the General Manager (Mark Stanford) if he wants to listen. We 4 persons stayed at the villas 13 - 22nd January 2014 and thought we were booking high end accommodation and don't mind paying for what we get however VERY DISSAPOINTED. In its day the Villas would have been on the mark but by todays standards not. Breakfast at best was luke warm and always soggy if you chance the accommodation, tell C151 when booking to  deduct the US $20pp they say breakfast costs from the daily charge and eat at Ku De Ta where we went daily as they know how to present real food. Staff tried very hard to please and did a good job under difficult circumstances even a young staff member Kharisma was upset that we were going to Ku De Ta for breaky and said he would speak to someone in the kitchen to try and resolve but we didn't bother. Mark your staff are the eyes and ears of your operation, so use them to your advantage if your truly care about your guests. I can say that I would never book into C151 again as there are far superior villas in the surrounding area.",

As the recently appointed General Manager of C151, I personally  appreciate your constructive feedback and insights. It is disappointing to learn that some aspects of your stay fell below your expectations. I have realised that current procedures in our food and beverage team do not allow us to constantly deliver a high quality and hot breakfast to our Villas and I am working immediately to fix this . While it is nice to know that you found the location to be exceptional, I assure you that I am leading, with the support of our wonderful team, to improve the quality of  maintenance and upkeep of our very popular resort  and ensure a better experience for all guests staying with us . \r\n\r\nRest assured, I have taken these comments very seriously. \r\n\r\nI hope you accept my  apology for the unpleasant experiences, however I encourage you and your guests to consider staying with us again in the future.   Please contact  myself directly at mark@c151.net and  I will personally ensure your experience will be a much better one, and that you walk away with many wonderful memories. \r\n\r\nThank you once again and I hope to see you soon to experience smart luxury at its finest.\r\nWarmest Regards,\r\n \r\nMark Stanford\r\nGENERAL MANAGER",

The WC is automatic flush, automatic bidet and even automatic open and close the toilet seat, a very comfortable toilet indeed. The curtains are operated with a remote, throughout all the rooms, upon checking in this villa,one has to learn all the remotes and their functions. I suppose that is the reason it is called a smart villa.\nThe villa is centrally located in Seminyak, walking distance to the restaurants, bars,shops and the beach, very convenient if you are looking to explore Seminyak.\nBreakfast is served in the villa, according to the order and menu. There is not much choice of breakfast menu and they all taste rather bland.\nThe reception staff was helpful,helped my daughter who sprained her ankle. I left my ipad in the lobby and they kept it for me.",

              "text": "I was actually super excited on staying at C151 Seminyak after reading some of the wonderful reviews at Trip Advisor but turn out to be dissapointed at the hotel. We were on a holiday with a group of 9 pax and stay at the 3 bedroom villa and spend 6 days and 5 nights here.\n\nI have spent the last 3 years spending NY celebration at seminyak area and trying out various luxury villas so i have a very clear benchmark on what to expect from these non chain hotels.\n\nLocation:\nThe hotel is conveniently located near all the \"right\" places, so if you want to go for a nice dinner or go to the beach it is within walking distance and even the hotel will provide shuttle to go to kudeta beach. \n\nFacilities:\nThe hotel actually has an interesting concept, it's modern and high tech which is kind of cool. Our three bedroom villa has jacuzzi, pool, automatic curtain, bose sound system and an interesting automatic toilet.\n\nThe issues were actually coming from the tiny details that were probably overlooked by the management as follows:\n\n1. The sliding doors were difficult to be locked and definitely need to be serviced in some of the doors.\n\n2. For a 3 bedroom villa, we were only given 1 key to get into our villa, and when i ask this to the staff, the response were a simple \"yes sir we deliberately only giving out one key per villa because the keys are expensive\".\n\n3. Jacuzzi was clogged when we use it\n\n4. Hairdryer didnt work and no one replace it up untill our departure from the hotel.\n\n5. And some other maintenance issues (Villa auto door issue,etc)\n\nServices:\nThere were a bit of issue of checking in (not the hotel's fault) because apparently the reservation is not made in our family member's name. \n\nIn general the service hospitality was okay, all the staffs were polite and doing the right things for us. The real issue comes from the lack of system and working efficiencies rather than the politeness of the staffs.\n\nOne minor incident occured during the check in, the receptionist staff was asking us whether we are in the right C151 because apparently they also have hotel in dreamland area. In all my years in travelling domestically i have never experienced being addressed by the word (in Indonesian language) \"kamu\" when she was asking us whether we are in the right hotel location. The exact question was (in Indonesian language) \"apakah kamu gak salah hotel?\"(loosely translated into \"are you sure that you're in the right hotel?\"). This is rather suprising because in every hotel that i know in indonesia even the budget hotel they always address their guests by Bapak/Ibu (Sir/Mam). But that was a minor thing and we were fine with it.\n\nThe real issue would be on the lack of system. One simple evidence was us in the first day to ask for an extra blanket. It took us 5 follow up calls and 2 hours later until we have our extra blanket.\n\nI am getting the sense that there were no solid coordination between the staffs, wrong menu being delivered on breakfast (when we were already put the breakfast forms as per instruction outside the villa), etc\n\nIf only the little things are being cared for, then this hotel would be a great place for a family holiday.",

The views from the hotel are spectacular, staff where the most kind and warmhearted people I have met. The pool's really big and we had a blast spending our time in there. It's a little far from the busy areas in Bali, around a 40 minute drive to Kuta. \n\nWe booked 3 rooms, however, they opened the stairs to the media room downstairs for us as well, which smelt a little off but wasn't too bad as we didn't really go there much during our stay. \n\nDefinitely worth a visit, don't know why it only has 2 reviews.",

Not only is the property centrally located to all of Seminyak's hot spots, the villas themselves are so beautiful that you don't want to leave!  The villa I stayed in (2 bedroom with media room) was was exquisitely appointed with the most high-end technology and the softest beds I have ever slept in!  The bathrooms were HUGE and amazing, with a giant soaking whirlpool tub and huge shower with rainfall shower head and adjustable handheld shower head.  The villa's pool space was beautiful, you could (and I did) spend all day there.  Be sure to order room service because the food is delicious and beautifully presented!\n\nAll in all, I cannot recommend this resort enough to you.  Treat yourself and stay here!",

The villas are located in the heart of downtown Seminyak, a few minutes' walk from Ku De Ta, market or boutique shopping, and dining.\n\nWe stayed two nights in a three bedroom villa. The bedrooms are spacious and comfortable, and the bathrooms are gorgeous. The separate bedrooms with large common areas make the villas ideal for travel with large groups of friends and/or family. Spacious grounds and high privacy walls turn the villa into your own private paradise in the middle of Seminyak.\n\nAlthough the accommodations themselves are incredible, the C151 staff take your holiday to a completely different level. Whether you're ordering room service, need directions, would like a reservation made, or simply have questions about Balinese culture, C151 staff respond to every request immediately and with a smile on their faces!\n\nI will absolutely stay at C151 when I return to Bali, and recommend it to anyone looking for accommodations in Seminyak.",

              "text": "We stayed in a 3 bedroom villa. Location in Seminyak not bad, not directly next to a beach however. Villas themselves and pool are good size and layout. Bbq we had at the villa on the first night was very good. Overall however the stay was marred by a list of problems. Two toilets did not flush properly and we needed to get fixed. One bedroom phone had to be replaced. The pool filters or pump had a problem so after the first day a dirty film appeared on the surface which was never satisfactorily fixed hence we could not fully utilize the pool. In house dining apart from the bbq was v average. Breakfast coffee was initially just made from instant powder till I complained. A member of our group asked for a head spa and was sent someone who did not speak english and did not have a working hair dryer. The blinds on some of the windows in our bedroom did not fully block out sunlight hence would wake earlier than we ideally wished to. As if to underline the problems there was a blackout on our last night which lasted 30mins or so. A few years ago this villa was probably high tech but we had to ask for an ipod dock which should be standard. On checking in and checking out their machine could not read my card despite my having used it without problem on the previous day at other locations. There were no real apologies made for all the troubles nor any offer of compensation. If we had not already been late for our airport pickup due to the card difficulties I would have pushed for this but did not have time. They charged $48 for airport transfer, admittedly a large van but we got another quote from a cab driver of 150,000 IDR ie around $15 so a ripoff.",

This is one of the best located villa property in seminyak.\n\nService is par excellence, check in took just 2 mins. meanwhile the luggage was shifted to our  2-bedroom + entertainment room (converted to kids room) villa, we were explained to operate the gadgets which were in huge supply and in every nook n corner of the villa;\nlike : Jacuzzi & steam room with TV Screens, motorized curtains, living room with expansive music system, entertainment room with electronic massage beds and the list goes on..\nThe breakfast is served right in your villa at your convenience. Room service menu is not too great but has something from every cuisine to offer.\n\nWe went during the Nyepi which is balinese new year and had to stay in the villa all day long with no outdoor activities. This could have been a disaster in any other hotel or resort but in C151 we enjoyed the villa's pool (which is quite big) with pool music system & kitchen to cook some INDIAN food. Not to forget the in-Villa couple massage just $ 60 for 90 min,, steal !\n\nThis place is a bit pricey compared to NUSA DUA luxury properties, but a different taste from regular luxury hotel rooms !",

              "text": "My partner, brother and sister-in-law have just returned from 8 days in Bali, 5 of which we spent at C151 Smart Villas. Having been to Bali 5 times previously, and being a huge fan of Seminyak, I found C151 to be perfectly located. Within walking distance of the beach, bars and restaurants, and yet far enough away for a little quite time in your villa. We stayed in a 3 bedroom villa, which we found to be very spacious, clean and tidy. The service was fantastic... nothing was a bother and all requests were actioned immediately. The staff were very friendly and happy to be of assistance. Their english was not the best but hey that's Bali, and if you are patient, speak clearly and simply communication is not a problem. The breakfast was ok, though as its not cooked on site and delivered to the villas, it's wasn't as fresh as an onsite breakfast. That said though we had no problems with requesting more juice, butter or brown bread instead of white etc. The staff were very accommodating. The high-tech gadgets i.e. remote control blinds, stereo and automatic toilet flash etc. gave the villas a point of difference and were quite fun. I'm sure there are better villas in Seminyak for the price however I doubt you'd find a better location and overall service and space provided at C151. I would definitely stay there again and recommend to others!!!",

              "text": "Spent 16 nights in 2 Bedroom Smart Villa. In fact all villas are identical. They open up 1, 2 or 3 bedrooms. This means that all the common areas are always available : Rather big swimming pool, terrace, living room, dining room and kitchen. The most \"high tech\" thing we found was the automated toilet. You get used to it after a while. The rest is equipped with remote controls :light, curtains, airco, tv etc. Nice are the loudspeakers throughout the villa (inside and outside) that can play the same music (MP3, Radio, CD). \nA major checkup of our villa would get rid of a number of small problems. But when a problem was mentioned, immediate  corrective action was taken. \nStaff are helpful, friendly and polite, although their English knowledge is sometimes limited. Hey, this is Bali...\nThe breakfast (included in the price) is always the same; Not bad, but not a highlight.You can allways get extra food or drinks in the nearby supermarkets, like we did. It is prepared in the central kitchen and then served in the villa.\nTo go to beach (in front of Kudeta), you just call for a buggy, who brings you there in 2 minutes. Nice and easy.\nThe C151 villa's are located in the heart of Seminyak, so no problem to WALK to many restaurants. \nWe would definitely recommend it to friends who are looking for a space to relax.",

The villas are promoted as luxury villas but they are quite run down and tired. Many things do not work such as air con machines or the pool speakers. There are broken cords having out from the tv in the bathrooms and cracked walls and tiles. \n\nThe breakfast in the mornings is quite limited and to be honest, compared to other villas, it's not very good quality.\n\nIf you can afford to stay somewhere else do so as these villas are a let down. They need to have a make over and they are only a few years old!\n\nThe only thing I would say is if you want to be close to Ku De Tah and the Oberoi and are happy with a run down place as a trade off then these villas are fine and will do.",

We found C151 really well located for the week or so we were there. I had a three bedroom which was pretty good and reasonably priced for my late booking, the hi tech stuff is a bit of a pain but you get used to it, nice big pool and reasonable set up outside. Major downside was break fast - it's not cooked in situ, it is delivered so, we found it average and tended to head out to various places for breakfast nearby (Grocer and Grind and a few others up that way).",

              "text": "Just got back from a 6 night family vacation in Bali june 18th to 24th. it was the perfect getaway. We stayed in the 3 bedroom villa. The location is excellent ... just a 2 minute walk to the beach (Ku de ta) as well as local shops and and eating places. \n\nThe villa was well maintained and and clean. The pool was also clean. We had a couple of  minor issues with the music system and the water level of the pool which were very promptly attended to by the maintenance staff - ( bravo to them). \n\nbreakfast was good and ample - (part of the deal) and always delivered and set up at our dining table  precisely at the time requested. \n\nThe staff was polite, always smiling and very non-intrusive which we loved.\n\nAs far as negatives - would have preferred an in-house tourism desk. The prices for tours quoted to us at the hotel were exorbitant compared to the brochures picked up at the airport. we ended up hiring a private taxi for the 6 of us which worked out just great and managed to get a much much better deal for the places we wanted to visit.\n\nA Word of Warning - not related to the Hotel - there is a money changer in a lane just ahead of mini mart on the right. His board will display the best exchange rates for Dollars and Euros - He will count out all the money in 50,000 notes and ask you to count it as well - Then place it in different piles on the counter he then asks for small change for the remainder amount  and at the last moment when your attention is diverted to giving back small change he will very cleverly remove one of the piles - I got taken once and went back with my wife and son and asked them to keep staring at the piles of money --- once he knew that the game was up ... he refused to change the currency at that rate and asked for a 10% commission and cleverly got out of changing the currency  \n\nApart from this one incident our holiday was superb. !!! Congratulations to the management and staff of C151 - well done guys - We would gladly return and stay with you.",

Personally it was just a bit much for me, but my tastes are more simple. \nIf you are after extravagance this is the place for you. They look just like the professional photo's - only you are there so it's even better. They wont disappoint you if you like what you see on the website. \nThe top floor pool is a really lovely touch - it's only a foot or so deep so it's nice and warm and you can just lounge around privately, looking at the ocean and just soaking up the good life! \nThe spa bath plus pools plus ocean views makes for a water immersed relaxing stay. There are playlists ready to pump through the surround sound, plenty of places to lie about, views from everywhere and more and more parts to discover as your stay goes on. \nDefinitely recommended for those with bounteous tastes (and budgets..)",

However when we arrived at our villa they had locked the media room and wanted to charge us an extra $100 a night to access it! We had to produce our booking confirmation to get them to unlock the room. We had also organised a late check out to 8pm prior to our arrival for an additional cost of $280.  I had to pull out the original email agreement to avoid being pushed out at 6pm. They also tried to charge us the $280 twice.\n\nIn our villa the sound system didn't work, the aircon in the main living room didn't work, there was an infestation of ants and there was construction work banging and clanging all day from next door.  I put some laundry in which came back with rust stains all over it. They agreed to not charge us for it, but then it showed up on our bill anyway, along with 2 beers at AUS $11 each that were never even in our fridge to begin with. \n\nThere are better options in Seminyak.",

I was thinking about what happened after and when we first arrived I called the villas from the airport and stated we had arrived and requested transport, she asked what the name in the voucher was and I told her my wife's names only and the booking reference no, what was odd was she then said my name which is on the voucher we have. They knew about the booking and are part if the advertising campaign to get people to there accommodation offering cheap rates then act like they know nothing about it. The receptionist has slipped up by saying my name. My bank is investigating the transaction and I have eBay and PayPal involved too.",

              "text": "We stayed in a 2 bed villa for 5 nights over Christmas. This obviously peak season cost $700/ night (4 people) incl breakfast. Which is on the expensive side in Bali for a family but we decided to treat ourselves for Christmas & stay somewhere nice.\n2 couples staying in off peak probably around $250 per couple which is not too bad.\nThe villas have good sized separate rooms with their own ensuites & spa baths in each. Which is gr8 for couples staying together. A toilet in the main kitchen/ lounge would have been handy.\nYou have a private pool area with your own lovely sized pool which is clean & well maintained. Outdoor speakers to listen to music out by the pool & speakers underwater too which my son thought was cool. I hate fighting to swim in a big hotel pool in peak season with thousands of kids so this was very pleasurable.\nBit slippery round the pool & walking into the wooden floored villas.\nThe location is great. Right near Ku de ta restaurant which is a really funky place, great food & a nice place to spend an evening watching the sun set over dinner.\nAlso not far from Potato Head, W, & Sarong all really lovely restaurants &  as the Balinese say they are the 'be cool' places to go.\nAlso a short walk to the beach (the staff will take you in a buggy if you like) a bit dirty like most Bali beaches I prefer to swim in the villa pool personally. The Oberoi St shopping strip is in the other direction & next door to the local flea market. Good exchange rate non commission money changer on the nearby St. ATMs in walking distance at Seminyak square or local minimart. \nTry to book your own driver for day trips to Safari park etc direct as its expensive through the hotel. ($40 for the whole day is a good price- it was nearly $70 thru hotel)\nThe hotel organised driver & golf for hubby in Nusa Dua it was very expensive & a long day! But closer & less costly is the golf course in Sanur apparently.\nFor those winging about missing out on a 10% discount on a massage at the villa (which must have been what about $15-20?) A great massage place opened called Bee 7 right next door. Go see Astri she is lovely & has worked in 5 star hotels around the world -she has magic hands. A 1 & 1/2 hour hot stone massage was $12 !! (costs $100 at home) Therefore not unreasonable to pay her a bit more  :) very relaxing & highly recommend it.\nThe welcome drinks & cold towels were lovely upon arrival at the villa. The staff were attentive & very friendly. The same butler for the stay would have made it much more personalised though.\nThe room service food was quite reasonable in price & quality. The beverages in the mini bar like water & soft drink were not expensive & saved a trip to the mini mart. Even better if restocked during the stay but sadly it wasn't which meant a trip to the mini mart which wasnt far away.\nThe fridge has cold water dispenser & ice machine connected to bottled water which is safe to drink & very handy\nDont use the villa laundry service it worked out to over $30 for a small family load of washing, we jumped in a taxi (with a meter)  & went to the nearest laundry, total cost $7 same day service incl taxi which was well worth it!\nA few of the gadgets didn't work from time to time but the staff were always on hand & ensured it was always fixed promptly & just minor things anyway like low batteries in aircon remote/ telephone, & sensor for glass door.\nBreakfast was nice a bit more variety like pancakes, proper muffins, pastries other cereals & also fruit like bananas, mango & strawberries would have been good.\nMassive road works on way in to Kuta at the moment which means for even more time spent in traffic :( So allow extra time to get to the airport \nI prefer fixed price shopping but don't mind bartering. But tourists who haggle prices over a few dollars drive me mad. the people have so very little seriously, make their day & give them some extra :))\nWe really enjoyed our stay & glad that we splashed out & treated ourselves to this lovely holiday. \nIt was our kids first trip & they loved it. Can't wait to save & plan our next visit.\nThanks to the lovely staff for making our stay so special over the Christmas period. The lovely Santa stockings with goodies were a lovely touch!",

              "text": "We stayed at C151 Seminyak 3 bedrooms villa for 2 nights in September 2012. We traveled as a group of 5. When it said 3 bedrooms villa, it's actually 2 bedrooms with proper beds and one massage room - where it has an electric operated massage bed covered with bed sheet.\n\nUpon arrival, we were greeted and a butler showed us around the villa and welcome drinks were nice. There were also complimentary 'fruit' basket which contained 3 green apples. We were unsure as there were 5 of us and only 3 apples. So we thought they forgot to put the fruit basket in the villa for us to share. When I questioned about this, they said yes,  the 3 apples are the complimentary fruit basket. The occupancy of 3 bedrooms villa is normally 6 people, 2 per bedrooms, and I was puzzled by the fact that we were supposed to share the apples among us. With a villa charging USD$600/night, I supposed asking for an apple/person is reasonable?!\n\nWe also booked for in-house massage and at the time I booked the accommodation i was given a 10% discount on Spa treatment. This service was paid upon check out and I didn't check the receipt as I thought they would've taken this 10% discount into account (my bad). So, when I realized they overcharged my credit card, I emailed them straightaway. Their only method of refunding is through bank account. I do not have an Indonesian bank account and getting them to refund back to my credit card took several emails chasing up and one month later they agreed to refund it back to my credit card.\n\nWhen you check out, please allow more time as they need to arrange a butler to the villa to check for the drink consumption which took longer than we expected.\n\nOverall the experience wasn't great, it was an average villa, the condition wasn't great anymore, it's a modern villa but you can feel it's not well taken care of.",

This place is just out of the world. The private pool was right at the entrance and the layout of the villa is awesome. The living room, was quite spacious and comfortable. \n\nThe best part is the technology that they have. Music wherever you go in the villa. There are so many televisions in the villa that we did not even get to switch some of them on even once! There were 5 i think! Electronically controlled curtains, lights, fans, they had it all. The toilet was quite high tech too ;) We even had shower options in the shower room! \n\nBreakfast was good and timely delivered and laid out in the dining area. Staff was prompt with all requests.\n\nThe villa ensures a lot of outdoor privacy. We spent a lot of time at the pool and there was comfortable furniture outside. \n\nThe location was fantastic and all the good restaurants are within walking distance.\n\nThe only drawback was the jacuzzi that never worked. There was some black stuff coming out of the vents which the staff tried to repair but could not succeed. \n\nBut that could not change our mind and this place is the best stay we've ever had! The stay could not have been better.",

Bedrooms and bathrooms also offer plenty of space. \n\nThe fitout is to a high standard, with bathrooms and the kitchenette well appointed.\n\nThe Villa offers an onsite villa BBQ service at a reasonable price (US 55 per head). The food was very good and there was certainly a lot of it.\n\nService is friendly and efficient. The staff go out of their way to be helpful.\n\nThe location is good, with entrances next to the Oberoi Hotel and just down from Seminyak Square. Bali's upmarket venues are nearby (Ku De Ta and Potato Head), and there are plenty of lesser dining options within walking (or a short taxi ride) distance.\n\nI could not fault the quality of the accommodation or service. However, the only point that stops me giving C151 full marks is the price, and hence value. At nearly SGD 3,000 for 4 nights, the price is pretty steep and I think that, for that price, you would want something absolutely stunning. C151 is very, very good but only average for value.",

              "text": "We've just returned from Bali.  We spent 3 nights at the W Resort in a 2 bed villa and decided to leave early as we weren't too impressed with the service or the villa itself, especially at the extortionate prices we were paying!!  We moved to the C151 villas and were over the moon.\n\nWe got a 3 bed villa which was spacious, had a huge lounge/dining/kitchen area, a massive pool which was super clean and 3 super clean, big bedrooms.\n\nIt was all very high tech with electronic lighting and curtains.  A double massage bed. Jacuzzis in 2 bedrooms, a steam room in another, even the toilets had TVs and electronic 'butt' washers and dryers.\n\nBreakfast was delivered to our villa every morning having chosen what we wanted the evening before.  It was beautifully set up on our dining table.  \n\nNothing was too much trouble and within 2/3 minutes of calling for anything, it arrived at our electronic, CCTV'd door!!\n\nThe location is perfect, as you're placed in central Seminyak where all the rstaurants and shops are.  It's 2 minutes to the beach and the C151 Villa buggies will take you there.  The famous Ku De Ta restaurant is also a short buggy ride away.\n\nOur only gripe was that we wished we had taken brand new, crisp, unmarked Dollar notes as they do not accept anything less for payment!!!\n\nA great place for a family holiday.",

My wife daughter an I stayed in the so called Presidential suite in January, it is supposed to be the hotel owners private villa. We had to move as all the gadgets failed miserably. The next villa wasn't much better. \nIt wasn't all bad because our rates were fantastic around $300 per night, they must be desperate because to be honest when we were looking it seemed like they would give us whatever rate we were prepared to pay.\nOur recommendation would be to avoid C151 unless you like the frustration of having high tech stuff that doesn't work.",

The pool was big and super clean, the bathrooms were huge and the whirlpool bath was an added bonus. Service at this establishment was good, we had a sick child and the staff were able to arrange a team of doctors to come to our villa to check on him.  Our garden lights were not working though as it would switch on and off (even if the hotel engineer came to look at it three times) so we ended up sitting outside in the dark in the evenings with only the lights from the villa.  Room service and breakfast is not fantastic and I was surprised to find a lack of Indonesian or Balinese dishes to choose from.  However, the location of this hotel is perfect as it is close to all the shopping, excellent restaurants, supermarkets and beach.  Ku de ta is literally right next door!  I was very happy with my stay at C151 villas.",

From the moment you walk through the doors and behold the splendour of the villa to the time you take your first dip in pool, this accommodation makes you feel like you have stepped onto a movie set.  We stayed in a 3 bedroom villa each with its own bathroom and toilet, 2 of the bedrooms having spa baths, the other having a steam room.  There are Tv's in practically every room, including bathrooms and toilets, I think we counted 7 televisions!! There are dvd players in all bedrooms and lounge rooms.  The villa itself is spacious and light and all rooms open up to the outside area which hosts a magnificent pool.The air conditioning in all rooms provides some respite from the humidity should you need to drag yourself away from the pool area!!!!! This accommodation whilst not cheap, definitely provides the traveller with the opportunity to have complete peace and quiet away from the routine of a working life.  Whilst we didnt make full use of the butler service, preferring to eat out, it is available 24/7 should you need it.  The villas are ideally located within a 2 minute walk of the beach, though to be honest, having a private pool to laze about in doesnt encourage you to make that walk to the beach!!!! There is a full cleaning service of the rooms daily and more so if you require extra towels during the day.  The staff are always on hand to tend to every request.  C151 is located next to Ku De Ta and The Oberoi and is within walking distance of some fantastic restaurants, bars and shopping. \nAll in all C151 Seminyak provides guests with a perfect break from the outside world to recharge the batteries.  Each Villa is so completely private and self contained that if you chose, you would not need to leave the villa and could immerse yourself in total peace and quiet!!!!",

We usually spent a lot of time outside the hotel/villa when in Bali, but here, we became too lazy to go outside because it was very comfortable just to stay in and, well, just get lazy :)\n\nWe have booked the same villa for our next Bali trip this April. Can't wait! :):):)",

Everything is so well organized and the price 1000 usd for a huge 3 bedroom villa during the peak season i guess not bad at all. Stuff is very pleasant and professionally trained, paid their best attention ever. we had one of the best times ever. they took care of everything...you can even find condoms in a fridge, huge massage bed which is so comfortable, music system with lots of different variety of cds, steam rooms, jacuzzi and electronic toilet bowl which has open and close buttons, dryer, front and back cleaning...that's all is just simply amazing!\nits a bit far from the beach but we didn't even need it as the pool was so big and clean. \nthe bad thing is that these villas are so good that you don't even feel like leaving it.\nwe are definitely coming back!",

              "text": "This is an independent collection of luxurious, high tech villas located in the heart of Seminyak.  There is very little in the way of common areas / amenities that you would find in a hotel or resort development, but each villa is very generously sized and self contained.  What you lose in terms of resort pool / restaurant / spa ambiance you gain in terms of privacy and space.  And while the villas have no beach frontage, they are right next door to the Oberoi, Ku De Ta and Seminyak Square.\n\nThe villas are in good repair, but are showing a bit of wear and tear.  We stayed in a 3 bedroom villa and each room had its own high capacity air conditioning, private bath suite, 2 with whirlpool baths and all 3 with automated Japanese Toto toilet units and tvs in the bathrooms. The central living area can be fully opened to the elements (glass concertina doors all around) and is surrounded by an excellent pool.  The living room has an attached entertainment area (big flat screen tv, dvd player, surround sound) with the ability to pipe music from an ipod or iphone to any/all rooms in the villa as well as the pool area.  No DJ required!\n\nBreakfast is provided each day via a roving butler on a golf buggy and while the range and variety is good, it would be a stretch to say that the quality is on par with the larger hotel chains. A small quibble really given the price.\n\nOverall, we think that C151 offers excellent value for spacious, high tech modern accomodation that is extremely well located for the delights of Seminyak.  While the on-site catering does not match the quality of the villas themselves, this is a very small negative (think of it as a free option, which it is given the price) as all the restaurants and bars of Seminyak are on your doorstep and this being Bali - they will deliver too!\n\nIf you are an independent holiday maker who does not need (or want to pay for) the infrastructure and amenities or a major resort / hotel, you should consider C151 in the Seminyak area.",

If you book through one of the discounted sites then it is a very good deal - full price would not be worth it.  A little faded.... Variable quality room service, variable staff.  Front desk really good but butler did not even bother to show us how the room worked properly leaving us to phone every time we needed something.  If I could put good rather than very good I would - it is more than average.",

              "text": "The C151 Villas are truly divine and very luxurious for the price.  There is a very understated small non air-conditioned lobby, so the arrival experience whilst welcoming, wasn't spectacular.  However once you get to your villa you will be amazed at the level of luxury.   This place is very high tech and once you get the hang of all the remote controls to open the curtains, another for the TV and another for the stereo system (the music is even piped under water in the swimming pool) you will love what the place offers in technology.   By goodness, even the toilet seat lifts up as you approach and flushes automatically when you finish!  I enjoyed buying dvds across the road for $1 and then watching them on one of the many tvs (there was even a tv over the bathtub)\n\nThese villas are possibly in the best location in Seminyak.  Slightly away from the madness, right next door to one of Bali's most popular bar and restaurants, Ku De Ta, yet a short walk into the action of bars, restaurants and shopping and a one minute walk to the beach!  The location is one of the key factors in staying at C151.  Taxis are everywhere (use only Bluebird taxis with a metre and they are super cheap)\n\nThe swimming pool at your villa is enormous by private villa proportions.  Two gorgeous double bed size sun lounges with a market umbrella sit at one end of the pool and its hard to tear yourself away from this environment to even bother leaving the villa.\n\nI loved the decor - very stylish and contemporary, although a little more colour around the place might have been an improvement.  The beds were amazing and so very comfortable and the bedrooms are of course all individually controlled with their own air conditioner.  Outside the villas and within the resort complex you would never know you were in a 5 star luxury resort as they have done very little to the public areas to enhance the look but step inside the automatic villa doors accessed by your keycard and WOW - the villas are amazing.\n\nThe staff at the villas are amazing.  Lead by Gede, the General Manager who was most accommodating with any request, the staff are on hand to clean, provide daily linen change, service the pool etc etc.  They are very sweet and courteous and discreet and no request went unattended to.\n\nIf you are looking for a three bedroom villa to accommodate up to 6 people, then look no further.  You'll be hard pressed to find something this amazing for the same price.  Very modern, very chic, very comfortable.",

              "text": "We have just returned from C151 Smart Villas, this was our first stay here and upon arrival to the villa we were worried as the main entrance and driveway doesn\u2019t look the best. Our check-in went smoothly and we were taken to our room with no problems and didn\u2019t have to wait however be prepared for a training course from the Butler in regards to how to use everything, all the high tech stuff ended up really getting on our nerves as we are on holiday and just want things to work simply without having to be instructed how to use it properly. I am up with how to use all the latest technology and this still annoyed me.....\nThe lighting in the rooms and bathrooms are terrible so take a mirror that you use outside if you are going to try and put makeup on!\nAnd be prepared to be attacked by mosquitos they were everywhere, so take some repellent and some spray to spray around the rooms. If you are going there with a baby I would suggest taking a mosquito net to put over the portacot.\nAnother thing is we travelled with our son who is 18 months old and I requested a proper wooden cot as he is a big boy so when we got to the room there was no cot at all so when the housekeeping staff brought it to the room it was only a portacot which our son wont sleep in.\nEach villa has a pool so I wouldn\u2019t suggest going there if you have small children it was too much of a worry.\nWhen I booked it said we get a full buffet breakfast included so I was under the impression that the villas had a restaurant that we went to each morning however you select what you want off a set menu and they deliver it to the room so the first breakfast we had there was horrible and cold so we ended up going down the street to eat, the second day we didn\u2019t bother to get breakfast through the hotel so went out again however on our last day we got breakfast as we had to leave for the airport at 9.30am and when breakfast came it was great so im unsure what happened there.\nThe villas are very modern and funky however in the day you can see they are a bit run down. I thought it lacked that Bali experience that makes it part of the fun going to Bali and you didn\u2019t see anyone around the villas so the interaction with people isn\u2019t there either.\nUpon checkout I booked the hotel Van for 9.30am and at 9.50am the van still wasn\u2019t there, when I proceeded to reception to pay the bill and check out the lady there just ignored me for at least 5 minutes \u2013 didn\u2019t even make eye contact or say I will be with you in a moment, nothing! So I stood there and stood there while she was on the computer and looking at a sheet of paper then she was on the phone so finally I had enough and told her I was going to be late, was she doing the bill and where is our airport transfer so I did find her to be a bit rude. Another customer also came to the desk after me and he stood there then after I complained to her he walked out.\nThen on our way to the airport our driver ended up smashing into the back of a truck and we had to pull over, we were all ok thank goodness however again we had a 18 month old baby in the car and he didn\u2019t even ask if we were ok or if the baby was ok all he said was sorry. We were going to abandon the van and flag down 2 taxis however after a little while the driver continued on to the airport however the air conditioning wasn\u2019t working.\nI definitely wouldn\u2019t stay here again I think there\u2019s so many better places to stay in Bali.",

              "text": "We came in after a 17 hours flight from Europe. The property is located in the overly busy Semaniyak, next to hotel The Oberoi. Your first impression of the villas certainly is disappointing. The reception was kind and hospitable, however the \"lobby\" is a bleak place without any character, withered flowers behind the reception, bordering what is meant to be a property swimming pool bordered by \u201cwhite\u201d walls , which looks all but attractive, no atmosphere, cold. Basically you want to leave the reception area as soon as possible. Once you open the door to your (2 bedroom) villa you will get a spacious living room, a clean and large swimming pool, two bedrooms, one with TV and surround sound DVD. If you like some tasteful interior design, you will be disappointed. The owner certainly has done his best but will not qualify as an interior design wonder. More importantly we found stained pillows on the bench, two wilted plants on the table and the bed corner was stained as were the sheets. Luckily when we called the staff was helpful to restore all this and soon we got clean sheets, stains were cleaned, plants replaced for fresh good looking ones and some rather sticky places in the villa were cleaned. The owner of the villas must have had a predilection for electronics, everything from curtains to lights to even the toilets are electronic. The TV room is well equipped with flat screens (even in the toilet..) and up to date audio equipment. \n\nLet us not be negative here as there are plenty of good things. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The rooms are spacious and when all doors are open and the sun shines it certainly is a very nice villa. The best way is to describe it as an alternative for a hotel suite. Pity that you have no view, as the compound is rather small and your villa surrounded by walls. If you are a spoiled guest and have had the pleasure of renting fabulous villas in Thailand, Bali, Malaysia, than this is OK but certainly not spectacular.",
