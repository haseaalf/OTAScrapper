              "text": "Kami berada di sana di Februari tahun ini selama bulan madu kami. Sebuah villa yang sangat pribadi, cocok untuk pasangan bulan madu yang akan mencintai beberapa privasi. Kami mengambil \"Nakula\" ruangan dengan deco oranye sangat cantik dan bak mandi outdoor / toilet. Sangat luas villa dan indah dihiasi dengan bunga-bunga sebelum kedatangan kami. Ketika kami tiba, kami memesan makan siang dari hotel dan itu dikirim ke kamar. Makanan yang baik tetapi akan lebih baik jika itu disajikan hangat. Salah satu pagi, kami telah sarapan di luar ruangan yang menghadap ke sebuah peternakan, hijau lezat dengan matahari pagi itu sangat menyegarkan. Kolam renang besar juga infinity kolam yang besar. Villa ini cukup jauh dari pantai dan fasilitas. Yang tersembunyi dan sangat pribadi.\n\nSempurna bagi mereka yang tidak ingin keributan dan keramaian Bali. Dan Ubud adalah surga bagi pecinta seni! Anda dapat menemukan kerajinan tangan dan lukisan yang indah. Kami membelinya beberapa.. haha! Murah dan bagus!",

Pandawa tidak hanya mengejutkan saya dengan pikiran bahwa semua askpeknya bagus tapi saya sangat terpesona. Situasi tenang dari Pandawa (walaupun hanya 15 menit dari Ubud) membawa anda ke gelembung kedamaian dimana anda dapat beristirahat dan memulihkan diri. Kamar yang sesuai dan mewah langsung terbuka ke dek kolam berenang dimana anda dapat menghabiskan hari sedangkan anak anda akan sibuk bermain di ruang bermain yang penuh dengan mainan dan buku. Staf sangat sopan dan sangat membantu..\n\nIni adalah tempat dimana saya ingin kembali lagi sesering mungkin dan sangat direkomendasikan.",

It has been a few days and management has yet to contact us. \n\nWe booked a room here after looking at the official website and from reviews from several travel sites. TripAdvisor rates this hotel as a 5 star luxury amenity hotel. It is definitely not. It close to a 3 star. This is not luxury. The room is in poor condition with several large cracks in the walls. Fridge is rusted and barely cold. Shared swimming pool is murky. Service is poor. We were not immediately greeted at the door and had to flag down a worker. Staff did not know the WiFi name or password. Major construction was being done next door and made the entrance look like a junk yard. It was not inviting. We did not feel safe with only a turnkey as a lock. Needless to say as soon as we found WiFi we booked another hotel. We did not get any money back. It was not even offered. \n\nOur room was called \u201cdeluxe room terrace\u201d which is conveniently not pictured on their website or on Tripadvisor. The quality is not even close to those villas pictured. There is no terrace. A patio was listed in TripAdvisor and there was none as well. We were adjacent to the main lobby and could hear the phone ring every time. The bedroom has two walls all windows. Sure they give you blackout curtains, but even with the blinds closed and curtains drawn, it feels awkwardly dark and everyone is literally on the other side of your room.  The free shampoo, soap etc were all mismatched. Only the bathroom seemed updated. \n\nBottom line. Don\u2019t stay here. We wanted to celebrate our honeymoon in a beautiful 5 star villa and this place was extremely disappointing and deceptive in its advertising. It may have looked 5 star when it was built but not anymore. TripAdvisor needs to update this listing. ",

                     "text": "Dear Guest,\n\nThank you for your review. \n\nYou came with the expectation of a hotel where as we have only promoted the property as a villa. It has 6 rooms and a common half olympic size shared pool. The pool is a natural pool and does not have city ceramic tiles which you wanted - this pool is made of natural limestone. Your expectation of a property with many tall buildings within the property and full of electronic gadgets is not something we have promoted or shared across any site. \n\nYou booked the deluxe terrace room which is our standard category room but has a huge private terrace all to yourself. However you wanted a room with a city feel. Ubud is not a city feel place - its a jungle - there are paddy fields, its quiet, people come here to relax to rejuvenate and to get away from electronic room feels. Standard room as per website and all sites - is a room that meets guest requirements and is different from the luxury villa room which is our luxury category which we offer in our other rooms. \n\nYou were however quite rude to our team - they tried to talk to you and offer you a free upgrade but you were not willing to listen to any of the staff. Ubud is a green feel - the entire property has few walls and more glass doors so that you can open and soak in the fresh village air and feel. As part of the management team - we agree you are a complete mis-match to the village feel we offer at the Pandawas. Our only request to you - if you want only a city feel within a property - please do your research well before booking. As much as it was not a comfortable feel for you - it is also upsetting for us when guests such as yourself speak impolitely to the team. The team only wants guests to be happy - hence it is important to show respect and patience. \n\nkind regards\nPandawas \nManagement Team \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We appreciated the free shuttle into Ubud and advice on tour options.\nWe were not bothered by the building work going on next door, it is far enough away for the work not to be audible.\nThe pool is a good length for laps and the setting is very beautiful.  It does need a little maintenance as some tiles have come off the floor of the pool.\nThe villa we stayed in was huge and the bed enormous and very comfortable.\nPandawas is close to the Kayon resort which has some very good balinese restaurants.\nWe enjoyed our breakfasts at Pandawas but can\u2019t comment on other meals as we did not eat there.\nIf you are looking for a quiet rural setting twenty minutes from ubud, close to beautiful rice fields and jungle by the river you won\u2019t go wrong with Pandawas.",

              "text": "We were very excited about travelling to Pandawas Villas having read all the excellent reviews online, but, unusually, it did not meet our expectations. I find it strange how people can consider it 5* when it quite clearly is not. Maybe it was unique to our experience, but having stayed in a great many 5* properties, this was some way off the mark. I will start with the positives: 1) the staff were mostly friendly and tried to help whenever we asked, 2) the free shuttle in and out of Ubud was a really nice touch (although also very necessary), 3) the pool is very picturesque (although cold and a bit murky), 4) the upstairs rooms looked really nice (ours was the only one downstairs - The Drupadi Room). The issues started on arrival for us. The warm welcome promised from other reviewers didn't materialise. For a start, there is a building site immediately outside the front door but no-one came to greet us or help us with our bags. The girl behind the reception desk looked nervous and unsure what she was doing. Nothing was explained to us - how to get food, how to order a drink, possible trips and activities, nothing at all. I would not say anything was wrong with the service per se, but it was nowhere close to the warm, friendly and informative welcomes we have received in virtually every other place in Bali during the two times we have visited. We were shown to our 'new' room and found it deeply underwhelming. It is not so much the bland decor or bright pink feature wall that put us off but more all the small things you just don't expect to be wrong in a 5* establishment - no curtains to block out the morning light, a mosquito net that didn't fit the bed, dirty pillows under the clean covers, a shower that didn't drain properly, a shower shelf that was poorly fitted to the wall. Some unsavoury-looking stains on the two bright pink bean bag chairs propped against the wall opposite the TV. Significant cracks in the walls which looked ominous. And all of this was on top of the fact that the room was under the hotel decking, so you could hear anyone walking overhead. We had to find out a lot of things for ourselves. No drinks menu ever emerged, if there was one, and when we asked for food, we received a very tired looking menu which we ordered from for one night only. The food was perfectly fine but lacked any sense of 5* quality. Exactly the same could be said for the breakfast - a really nice touch to have it brought to the room and perfectly fine, but without any real sense of class about it. We did ask if tours were available and a brochure was produced from which we selected the half-day tour, which went well. Nobody at the hotel asked us how it went. In fact there seemed to be different people on the desk every time we were there (and sometimes no-one at all) - the much-championed owner, from other reviews, did not seem to be around at all, which was a shame, because the staff urgently needed someone to model good practice. This came to a head when I had to show the man behind the reception desk how to work the card machine when it came to checking out! Very rarely do I disagree with TripAdvisor raters, but on this occasion I really do. Perhaps it was the room, perhaps it was the time of our visit, perhaps it was just bad luck, but I was wondering whether I should have booked Royal Kamuela (our last hotel from a few years ago) and I deeply regret not doing so. And this is not just about expense. We have just arrived at Tito Villas on the north of the island, a fraction of the cost of Pandawas, and it has exemplified everything Pandawas is not - superb customer service, tasteful rooms with attention to detail, stunning decor, and staff who go out of their way to make the experience an enjoyable one. Pandawas may be an oasis of calm in Ubud to some, but to me it is a hotel that doesn't know who it is and who is over-luxuriating in 5* reviews it doesn't really deserve. Could do so much better with some attention to detail and staff training.",

                     "text": "Dear Guest,\n\nThank you for your feedback. At Pandawas we always try to make our guests smile and take back happy memories. We are sad to read that your stay with us did not meet your expectations. Most of our guests have found the team always welcoming, kind, helpful and friendly. That is one of the reasons we have always received a 5* rating from our guests. \n\nYou checked in during Kunningan which is a holy festival in Bali. Most staff are on leave at this time of the year. The staff on duty was a trainee when you checked in and if she was nervous \u2013 it\u2019s perfectly fine. As a trainee we are all nervous. She did her best to help you, talk to you, reply to your questions as best as she could. The older staff on duty attended to you as fast as he could. Bali is a rural holiday destination \u2013 everyone is polite and courteous and there is no hurry to get you into your room the moment you arrive \u2013 we usually wait for the guest to be seated, relax, enjoy the welcome drink and then we guide the guests to their rooms. For all of this you need to be patient, sit back and enjoy. We do not have a policy to jump on the guest the moment they arrive and bore them with commercials do\u2019s and don\u2019t s. \n\nWe would also like to share \u2013 you booked the deluxe terrace room and not the luxury villa room. As in hotels, in our villa also there are \u201croom types\u201d \u2013 while all rooms offer comfort and relaxation \u2013 there are bound to be differences. Your room has a stunning terrace deck overlooking the beautiful jungle \u2013 a view many desire. A happy soul smiles in the face of nature \u2013 we are sad to read all you could find were cracks. You could have also discussed all your confusions and complaints with the staff the next morning \u2013 however you did not say a single word to any of the teams working morning or evening. The teams have been trained to not be in your face \u2013 that we believe is good practice. If you prefer hotel desk service with phones ringing and buzzers buzzing, then most definitely a villa is not a suitable place for such guests. We do believe strongly in over-luxuriating our guests with peace and happiness. \n\nWe thank you once again for your feedback. We also appreciate that you are a smart budget traveler \u2013 you negotiated with the staff for drop to a location which is a 3-4 hours\u2019 drive and were not willing to pay the requested taxi amount. Please do understand \u2013 taxi drivers work hard too \u2013 the given driver came on our request only to help you \u2013 since mostly everyone in Bali was on leave -and therefore if someone comes to work on their special holy day, the point needs to be respected. \n\nThe team knows how to take care and make guests happy. We hope all our guests always stay happy and blessed. \n\nKind regards\n\nThe Pandawas\nManagement Team",

We especially enjoyed spending time with Nauliawan. He was great to talk to and a wealth of knowledge. There are only four villas, so you really get a personal touch. Renting out all four villas with friends or family would possibly be my definition of heaven on earth. Pandawas provides free breakfast delivered to your room each morning and a free shuttle to Ubud City center. Pandawas arranged for poolside, couples massages two of our nights and those may have been the best nights sleep of my life. I can't say enough good things about this place and the people. They were great.",

So make sure you know where it is, just a few km north east of UBUD Centre. It was worth every second of the extra hour he took to get there. \n\nWe were amazingly the only ones staying there (think there are only 4 rooms), so it was like our own private hotel. Charming helpful staff who drove us into dinner in Ubud for our first night, and then back to the hotel. Complimentary shuttle.\n\nLovely breakfast outside our huge and luxurious room. Fabulous enormous bed. I could go on and on. Would stay again without question.\n\nBeautiful place, wonderful pool, glorious tropical setting. Good wifi too. Just go there.",

              "text": "I can't say enough good things about the staff and property at Pandawas Villas! First of all, the villas are quite large and the outdoor bathroom is really unique and enjoyable. There are only 4 villas at the property so it's very quiet. The villas face the large pool and the jungle. We even saw about dozen monkeys up in the trees as we were sitting by the pool! Breakfast was included and it was fantastic. They serve it to you wherever you'd like to eat, be it in bed or by the pool with views of the jungle at whatever time you'd like. Eggs cooked to order, fresh squeezed juices, tea or coffee, fruit, bread or croissant. \n\nContact the staff in advance if you need transportation from the airport. They arranged it for us at a good price. Same for a tour of the Tegallaland rice terraces, elephant cave, a temple & a coffee plantation as well as our ground transportation to our next stop, the Hilton in Nusa Dua. We also booked several massages while we stayed here and they were very reasonably prices and good. I believe it converted to be around $15 for an hour massage. \n\nThey also have a shuttle that will take you it to town. We found it was often more efficient to just take a taxi back to the villas from Ubud but great option for getting into town, and it's free. \n\nI would recommend Pandawas Villas to anyone traveling to Bali. It is a great value for the price, the staff & grounds are fantastic and the cooked to order breakfast can't be beat!",

They help to facilitate everything for you, I felt pampered and safe. Breakfast is made to order and can be enjoyed any time and wherever you like.\nThe grounds are beautiful and well kept, very quiet and private. It's a little ways from the main part of town but there is a free shuttle to take you to Ubud center. You really  have the best of both worlds, the peaceful village life amid the rice terraces and easy access to the vibrant scene of Ubud town center. One can take nice walks in the small surrounding village and admire the scene of everyday life. Great place to unwind  and let go of stress.\nThe villas are spacious, well decorated, big outdoor bathroom with a small garden, a small refrigerator but no microwave. \nI highly recommend it, can't wait to go back. Many thanks to all the staff, you are wonderful.",

We were thrilled when we first saw it. \n\nLove the outdoor bathroom as well - there is an option of a rain shower or a bathtub. \n\nPandawas also provides drop off and pick up to Ubud centre - so that's a bonus!\n\nAll in all, loving the tropical theme of Pandawas Villas. We are mighty glad to have discovered this little hideout! :) \n\nFull review on BelAroundTheWorld[.]com.",

              "text": "First of all, thank you dear Pandawas team, you made ours six days in Ubud just perfect. We really enjoyed every minute at the Pandawas Villas. Due to a delay of our transport we arrived late at night at the resort, but wehe staff waited and gave us a very warm welcome. Even the Barwas closed, they served us a couple of cold drinks and made the arrival very comfortable. \n\nThe staff was all the time very thoughtful and attentive, so revelry question was answered and any help was given, transport to Ubud, renting a bike, hints what to do. \n\nSo if you want to escape the hustle of Ubud, which can be very crowded and stressful sometimes, the Villas are the perfect place to enjoy the beauty of the Ubud area and relax in this beautiful resort. The Villas are extremely spacious, the bed is very comfortable, the technical equipment is REALLY good, so you have a decent mataranz Amp with surround you, an iPod doc (only 30 pin adapter, but works fine), a 3,5mm audio jack, to connect your device, many power jacks, good wifi (enough for streaming netflix) and in the lounge, there is a PS3...  if you really don't know what to do ;-) but the best thing is, there are only 4 Villas, so it will never get crowded (if you like that). The whole are of Pandawas is beautiful arranged, many ponds, gardens, flowers... is all very nice. The pool has a really good size, so it stretches about 20 meters or even more, so serious swimming is possible.\n\nSo all in all, great accommodation, super friendly staff, perfect situated, and just beautiful ;-)\n\nOne hint... if you are into breakfast,: they don't have a buffet, you can choose between, continental, American and pancakes. If it's not included in in your rate, they charge 140.000 IDR",

              "text": "We staying at Pandawa villas with our toddler and baby for 4 nights. \n\nPros: The villas are spacious and beautifully designed, really very lovely. The bed was very comfortable and everything was very clean. The location is around 10-15mins from Ubud and they offer free pick-up and drop off which was great. \nThe staff at the villas were amazing. There were very helpful and did their very best to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. We also took advantage of the massage service that was offered and it was very good and well priced.\n\nCons: The outdoor bath has been converted into a shower, so whilst there are pictures on their website and marketing to relax in this beautiful outdoor bath, this is no longer the case and that was pretty misleading. I had actually chosen this villa over a few others I was looking at because of the large outdoor bath. As I have a toddler and baby I thought that a lovely outdoor bath like would be sort of like having our own private plunge pool, but without the drowning risk for the toddler, so I was quite disappointed to find no bath. The water pressure was also terrible. They have these beautiful large rain shower heads both in the outdoor shower and over what was the outdoor bath, however the pressure is so terrible that when turned on full a trickle just dribbles out of the middle of the showerhead and can't even fill 85% of holes to form raindrops. It was similarly bad in the handheld showerhead. I expect this may have something to do with why there is no longer the ability to fill the bath as it would probably take 2 days to fill it! I did get someone to come to the room and check the pressure and complained about it however there was not much he could do and said it was how it was. The staff were very thoughtful however and did bring me a baby bath to wash my baby in given there was no useable bath in the room. \nThere is quite a bit of maintenance work needed, mostly lots of little things. The toilet, for example, was not cemented properly to the floor, so everytime you sat on it or got up it would wobble, pool tiles coming loose, and several little annoying things like that. On the last day my husband walked onto the deck outside our room and near put his foot right through it as the wooden decking had rotted through. Our side of the pool was much better than the other side however which was really terrible and scary to walk to for fear of falling through and I kept my toddler well away from that side. The rest of the grounds (away from the villas and reception) also needs maintenance. \nFood ordered to the room comes from off-site and ours arrived cold and didn't look so fresh so I wouldn't recommend that. Breakfast wasn't particularly great either however it was fresh. I also tried to order several drinks off there drinks menu however many of the items were not available which was annoying (if not available don't put it on the menu). There were no tea or coffee provisions in the room which was annoying and I really didn't want to call up to both someone late at night to get one nor wait to have it made (and pay for it).\n\nOverall this villa has so much potential. The rooms are fantastic and the overall setup and design of the villas/ reception/ pool areas has been very nicely done. The staff are also already fantastic and I couldn't rate them highly enough. If management sharpened up their game they could easily make this a true 5 star villa. It's the little things like tea/ coffee, having enough towels (not having to ask for enough towels), plus pool towels, and taking care of all the little maintenance things for example which makes all the difference.The water pressure also must be fixed and marketing material changed to make it clear there is no bath.\nIn its current state I'd rate it fairly at about 3.5 stars. We did have an enjoyable stay overall (but just not quite the 5 star level we were used to and expected).",

              "text": "My girlfriend and I stayed at Pandawas Villas for about 7 nights at the end of December 2016 and it was EXTRAORDINARY!  First, I must say that Pandawas is not directly located in Ubud\u2026and that this is a very good thing.  The villas are in Tegallalang (sp?), only a short ride from town, but it makes all the difference.  It provides a very relaxing escape from the busy streets of Ubud.  \n\nThe property has beautiful lush flora, a large pool, and the villas are quite large and spacious.  The outdoor bathroom is incredibly relaxing as you awake in the morning and shower.  You may even have visits from critters on the property, as a macaque briefly stopped by while we were there.  It\u2019s just a very relaxing and beautiful property.  \n\nIn addition to the perfect property and room, the staff was probably the kindest and most accommodating staff that I have ever interacted with.  I wish that I could recall all of there names (it has been awhile) because they deserve acknowledgment.  There are certain times when free shuttle service is available, and when we accidentally missed the window a couple of times, they took us to town regardless because you can tell they just want you to be happy.  \n\nWe enjoyed the breakfast options at Pandawas.  If I had to give just one minor criticism, it is that ordering your food is not very convenient, as I believe the food is prepared either off property, or it just takes a while to prepare it.  You have to order meals in advance, which can complicate things if you don\u2019t have a set itinerary.  Still..this is just one minor thing in the grand scheme of it all.  \n\nJust a special note here: walk uphill along the road that led to Pandawas.  You will eventually pass into a village after a 15-20 minute walk. Although the dogs were a little intense (they bark like crazy), it was a very educational experience to see a Balinese village and was something I\u2019ll never forget. It was no \u201ctourist trap\u201d\u2026just people going about their day.  \n\nOverall, I highly recommend Pandawas for the beautiful and serene property, and the amazing staff.  Thank you all for giving my girlfriend and I a wonderful experience.",

When you arrive you feel like you're in the middle of the jungle, but you are a meere 5-10 minute drive from central Ubud. From arrival to depature, we received the best service from the staff. They are caring and tentative and were most helpful with any request. The toilet and shower of the apprtments are outdoor, which at first was weird, but after the first night really cool actually and something we were fond of. Since the hotel is small the food service isn't overwelming. You can't just order as in a restaurant, but need to give notice in advance. The food though is good. Going out to dine is easy, since the hotel offers free shuttle or taxi by payment. We rented a scooter which was a game changer and made it possible for us to relax completely, not having to follow any time tabel. Ubud and the surroundings and great. Ubud has a very hippie, yoga, vegan vibe, that is really relaxing. \n\nPadawas Villas is recommended if you want to pull the plug in complete luxury. ",

The high ceilings are beautifully decorated in the Indonesian style. \nThe pool is really enjoyable with an area for smaller kids.\nThe hotel garden is fabulous with a preserved forest on one side and rice terrace on the other. One morning, we even saw a monkey during breakfast throwing itself from tree to tree.\nThe free shuttle was really useful to go to Ubud market (10min) and enjoy local food and art.\nThey even organized a whole morning tour of Ubud area with a visit of temples and rice terraces.\nOn top of that, people working there are really nice and helpful.\nBecause there is only 5 rooms, it feel even more cozy and intimate.\nIt is definitely a great place to stay for family or couple.",

              "text": "Arrival and service in general - no one ever around.  had to constantly look for staff to get a drink or order food.  Food was OK.  Not the typical standard of Ubud.  Indonesian menu could do with more options/variety.  Range of food was poor (why so much Indian?).\nCommon areas/dining area - lovely and ambient, but not exactly well maintained; the decking around the pool is rotting, the pool lounge chairs/beds are on their last legs and the cushions were thin, ripped and dirty.\nRoom - Spacious but very dated.  Furniture was old, worn and a bit greasy.  Huge bed but mattress hard as a rock, only a very thin mattress cover (terry towelling) without a pillow top or decent level of protection from actual mattress.  Did mention this to staff who suggested they could try to find a different mattress but that was it.\n\nAnts everywhere even in bed which I know is part of staying in the jungle but these suckers were biting.  Thankfully, there were hardly any mosquitos.  \n\nHad a massage - that was pretty good, seems that they outsource it from somewhere else though.\n\nNoise - woken up at 5am by cars and motorbikes in 1st or 2nd gear trying to get up the big hill that the resort is on.  Also the aircon in the room was quite creaky.  Probably not a big deal unless you're a light sleeper or would rather hear the sounds of birds/nature, as we prefer.  \n\nWe were booked in for 4 nights but checked out after the first night as the Villas really don't live up to the advertised conditions or photos.  The whole place needs maintenance and new furniture, its very dated - circa 1970 maybe - and we were generally just very uncomfortable there because everything we sat on was either rock hard or about to break or covered in grime.  Really easy stuff to fix/maintain but it looks like the garden and the pool get the maintenance money but little else.  Place has real potential but its not managed well (didnt see any management staff at all) nor did the staff seem to take pride in their Villas or their customer service.  I did discuss this with the receptionist who said it was not part of their policy to provide refunds for guests who weren't happy although she'd speak to a manager.  I was not asked if i'd like to speak to the manager which may have been more productive.  Was eventually offered 50% off of the last night (so about $60) - which was more insulting than anything and I politely declined and asked them to put it toward investing in mattress toppers for the beds.  Very bad customer service policy in my opinion - you never tell a guest that you don't refund in the event they are unhappy.  I think the general norm is to first apologise and then offer complimentary meal or a drink and if there is no solution to the noise / bed issue - discuss cancellation terms.  They were VERY keen to be paid for all charges upfront as well - that should have been the first indicator that the priorities of the place were a bit off.",

                     "text": "Dear Guest,\r\n\r\nThank you for your review. \r\nUbud is a place to come and enjoy nature - we have promoted the open spaces and tranquility and open bathrooms through all sites. For those who need a city feel - we always advice staying in 100 room hotels. Our villas only have 4 villa rooms spread across 7000sq.m of land and the staff have been trained to be inconspicious. \r\n\r\nThe feel and ambience as the name suggests is minimilistic and rustic. Again if you need modern feel - its always best to opt for city hotels. We use the best possible mattresses - King Koil Chiropracter (this point is clearly stated in the website) - which are top of the line. Many city hotels use spring beds - if your requirement is a basic spring mattress then again city hotels are the best option for your family. \r\n\r\nWe apprecaite all your feedback. However the issue was not so much in our villas as it was in your need to leave for Jimbaran post discovering that some of your friends are around in Bali. You wanted to take the opportunity to check out earlier than committed and move into the villas your friends had booked. Since we were fully sold out we could not offer any rooms to your friends. That was when you started making a fuss about everything around you which for the first 2 days of your stay did not seem to bother you at all. \r\n\r\nRef Menu - we offer a complete range of Salads, Breads, Indonesian, Balinese, Italian & Indian foods. There is a lot of choice for 4 villa rooms. Again if you prefer to eat pre-prepared frozen foods thats not a choice on our menu - please do understand we only cater to fresh foods - our motto is Eat Healthy Freshly Prepared Foods!\r\n\r\nkind regards\r\nPandawas Villas Management Team",

Best was we had the choice of Indian vegetarian food as well. Being veggies , we just loved every moment of our stay here. It's a privately owned property with only four rooms leased out for guests. We consider ourselves fortunate to have been able to experience the true Ubud and Bali thru Pandawas villas. Each room is testimony to the immense aesthetic sense that is true to the theme of Pandawas( the last 5 great warriors to have graced this earth, according to Sanatana Dharma- written in Sanskrit, ancient Indian language)",

There are 4 large villas that surround a beautiful pool.  While we were there, 2 of them were under construction and the other villa was vacant.  So, for our time there it was just my little family!  It was heavenly.  The food was just amazing.  They were so helpful with the kiddies.  They brought in a nanny for us to use when we went to yoga every morning who was just incredible with the kids.  They provided fish food for the kids to throw to the bright orange fish in the ponds every day.  It was the highlight of my kid's day!  Every time we came and went they offered the warmest greetings.  Pandawas was so flexible with our schedule and helped us book everything and even drove us into town or to the orphanage whenever we needed it!  We were supposed to leave after a week and go to the Gili Islands, but loved it so much we extended another 5 days!  I can\u2019t praise them enough.  We\u2019re forever grateful to the incredibly kind staff at Pandawas and will absolutely be back!",

The location close to the valley and the lovely pleasant weather made the stay even more memorable.\n\nThe service is top grade and the staff took extra care that made our stay comfortable without being in the least intrusive.\n\nSince we were a large family group of 10, with ages ranging from 12 years (my younger daughter) to 78 years (my dad). \n\nThe best part was that ALL 10 of us feel in love with the property. \n\nI would strongly recommend this property and would definitely visit Pandawas again.\n\nGreat job Pandawas team.",

Staff is so friendly and read our minds. Breakfast is included and we enjoyed it on the terrace above the rice fields. It's a 15 minutes drive from the center of Ubud, but hotel offers free shuttle. Thanks for the amazing time we spent there - would always recommend this place!",

It is this beautifully hidden paradise with a gorgeous rolling estate filled with canopies of numerous flora and fauna surrounding you. The view beyond the immense pool is breathtaking. There are only 4 villas, which is so peaceful and intimate but with easy privacy, each with generous space and stylishly designed. For a traveling family such as ours it was just amazing. The impeccable service, attention to detail and care the local staff gave us, they were just so helpful with everything. We had delightful massages, the food was good, there was a TV room for the kids to be entertained. Our room had enough space for the children and they even provide play pens/cots if you travel with your baby. Space and good quality was not spared and the feeling of the place all in all was so lovely and serene. We can't wait to go back and will definitely recommend it to all our family and friends. ",

              "text": "This hotel consists of 4 villas set around a beautiful pool overlooking the jungle. The set up is good for young kids- you can see your room from the pool and lobby/dining area so can keep an eye on a sleeping child while not actually being confined to the room. The hotel is out of town so you need a driver to get into Ubud, but this was easily arranged with the staff (and not charged, even though we didn't go at the specific shuttle times). The downside of the location though is that you cannot walk to any shops or restaurants- there is a big steep hill to get to the villa so you are essentially marooned there without transport. Some minor negatives- food & drinks at the villa took AGES (1hr+) to be delivered once ordered, and were overpriced. Breakfast however was very good (included) although be clear about your order as they got it wrong with us. The mosquito net provided for the childs cot did not fit; our daughter got bitten. Staff leave doors open letting mosquitos in. Obviously not a concern for them but it was for us. Overall this was a good place to stay, but be aware of the above points.",

Hence it takes a bit longer than usual to serve. We do not keep any foods in storage. Apologies if housekeeping left the room door open - we have already taken necessary action on this point. We always take care that there are mosquito nets which cover not only the main bed but also the extra beds. \r\n\r\nWe look forward to hosting you again. \r\n\r\nkind regards\r\nPandawas Villas Management Team",

The property is majestic, with big well appointed rooms and a 25m pool looking over the lush Ubud valley. Breakfast was simple and well made, there's a gaming room for the kids and we had massages by the pool. We can't wait to come back and we highly recommend it to all our friends. Thank you Pandawas!

The four guest rooms are decorated differently based on the history of the Pandawas, and the bathrooms embrace the outdoor concept. The owners of this property told us the fascinating story behind the building of this villa and how it is entrenched in the betterment of the community it is located within. I loved having breakfast overlooking the paddy fields. Thank you very much for this memorable vacation.",

Wish we could have stayed here longer. The service was great and rooms were beautifully done and spacious and they overlooked the greenery around and the pool. In the morning one could even hear a cock-a-doodle-doo which was Whoa!!! :-))). The hosts are very particular about the maintenance and upkeep or the place and also ever eager to get feedback on the place and service..so here goes my recommendation to all who plan to visit Indonesia, do visit this exotic yet affordable place!!! Truly Indonesia at its best!!!",

              "text": "If you want to experience tranquility and bliss in the middle of the rainforests of Ubud, then this is the place to stay. We stayed at Pandawas for 3 nights and were delighted with the experience. Unlike most of the hotels and resort rooms, the room here was massive, tastefully done up and came along with, a rainforest shower. The grounds are lush with Koi ponds surrounding the villas and our stay was complimented with all the amenities you would expect from a 5 star resort. The main Patio or Lobby, with its beautifully carved rooF,  is great to lounge around in and enjoy a cup of coffee. The fact it overlooks the infinity pool is a Bonus. Due to limited number of villas, we were able to relax and enjoy the infinity pool which over looks the paddy fields, with complete privacy.  Whats more, when we needed a separate bed for our 8 year old, the lovely staff was glad to oblige. Personally, I found the staff to be very helpful and friendly. In fact, when me and my son wanted to go to the main square in Ubud,  2 of the staff members volunteered to give us a ride on their motorbike as waiting for another half hour for the shuttle service would mean that we would have missed out on a performance that we were keen to catch. We had an absolute blast!!!  I would highly recommend Pandawas Villas to everyone and in fact look forward to coming back next year. Hopefully for a much longer time!!",

The rooms are huge and well decorated with outdoor bathrooms which are beautiful and very private (my favourite part of my room, not least because of the little frogs). The food which was all very tasty is cooked to order for you, no rubbish buffet in sight, but I think you need to get food for lunch outside the hotel. If you like wildlife then this place is just fantastic. There were all sorts of frogs, lizards, birds, butterflies and even glowing insects in the paddy fields at night! Finally the staff were all fantastic, they were so friendly and welcoming I really felt at home there. The best hotel I've ever stayed in. Thank you so much!",

The property was very well located, just out side the noise range of Ubudh. It takes about 20 mins to walk out but for peace and quiet it's the place you want to be. They had 4 huge Villas or rooms built around a pool with a huge lobby which has a nice sitting area, bar and dining area. You have to order meals in advance as it's run very well and like a home. All the food you get is fresh. Property is well meaintained and highly recommended to stay at",

              "text": "I must begin my review with a disclaimer: I made a reservation a long time ago but tried to cancel within the 30 day period, which could not be done.  Thus I was quite disgruntled when I showed up there 2 weeks ago for a 5 night stay.  Nobody is more surprised than I am now, to find myself utterly in awe and in love with this place and its people. If you've been there, and experienced its magic, you know what I mean.  It is like no other.\n\nBefore we got there, I wrote to the villa to see if I could request for the Nakula villa.  To my delight, they granted my request!  So we had this spectacular view of the greenery on one side of the room through big windows, and it was a joy to wake up to it every morning.  The beds were firm and comfortable, and we slept soundly thanks to the AC and mosquito nets.  Because there are only 4 villas, and everybody came and went at different times, we did not see anybody else at the pool whenever we went swimming, which was almost every day.  The infinity pool is beautiful, just big enough to have  a good swim but not too big to intimidate.  My children had so much fun in it.  They clean it meticulously every morning before the guests use it.  \n\nThe best part about Pandawas is its people, and how discreet they are.  They quietly take care of everything for you, from cleaning to cooking to serving, but then they leave you alone, and don't hover over you.  If we were not having jet lag and waking up in the wee hours to see them work, I swear we would think that this place just runs on its own.  You rarely see anyone around.  Even the people at the front desk are quiet, though polite and friendly.  Wayan is always ready to give us a ride to or from downtown Ubud whenever we ask, and he is patient and kind.  Ani is sweet and friendly and loves kids.  Their breakfast offerings are excellent, but you need to order it the night before and let them know when and where you want to eat it.  As a rule, whatever you want to eat, you need to give them at least a 2 hour notice,\n\nThe only complaint I have is that sometimes the electric current gets all wacky, and the lights and AC will flicker on and off for a few times in a row.  The first time it happened in the middle of the night, at 4am, the lights turned on and off repeatedly and woke us all up.  Since we were already suffering from a jet lag, we gave up on sleep soon after that.  It happened again during the day before we left.  Each time it would repair itself and go back to normal.  Also the wifi is quite spotty.  I could never get any sort of connection in the bathroom, but if I move to the front of the villa it's ok.  BTW the bathroom is gorgeous, I could spend all my waking moments there.\n\nOn our last morning there, my husband and I decided to have a Traditional Balinese massage.  That was icing on the cake.  Our masseuses were excellent, and it was done in one of the cabanas facing the greenery, so we could hear (but not see) our children playing in the pool while we got pampered.   It was a total bliss!\n\nIn the end I am happy that I did not manage to cancel my reservation at Pandawas.  Our Bali memory was luscious and beautiful, thanks in no small part to our stay at Pandawas,  Yes it would have been better if it were closer to downtown Ubud, instead of taking 15 minutes to get there.  But we enjoyed coming back here, to our retreat, at the end of every busy day, to soak in its pool or shower in its turkish bath.  We loved waking up to the soft light that sneaks into our room every morning.  We revel in exploring the grounds, and discovering the viewing platform that has a view of the rice terraces nearby.  It *IS* heaven on earth.  Thank you, Pandawas.",

              "text": "We were travelling with 2 teenage kids and coming in via singapore after a week of day long hectic schedules in the various amusement parks , gardens and malls and needed some place to rest our body and souls and Pandawas was the perfect choice for us with its relaxing ambiance, luxurious rooms and a perfectly located pool. The surrounding rice terraces and forest added to the relaxing stay. Starting from the cold towel provided by the driver who came to receive us to the ever smiling Annie  at the reception desk the staff was very helpful to us and arranged for all the local site seeing. The breakfast provided was ala carte and we were and we were able to order as to our choice. My son enjoyed the pool and the PS3 games provided in the games room of the resort. We will always remember our stay and will try to return someday.",

The attention to the detail is what struck me as the most impressive - from the perfectly laser cut metal shades to the detailing of the exquisitely beautiful hand crafted wooden ceiling high above the Arjuna lounge, to the pleasing distinct fragrance unique to each villa.  Our stay was extremely refreshing with the children enjoying the beautiful pool while we relaxed to a massage and beautiful views of the lush greenery. Our young daughter has decided to move to Bali as she absolutely fell in love with the Pandawas villas.  Hopefully, we can return for another taste of this piece of heaven on earth!",

              "text": "Spent the last night of a long honeymoon at the Pandawas and it was simply the best out of all the other 5 places I stayed at during my almost month long visit to Bali.\n\nThe place spells character from the moment you walk in. You a greeted by a huge lobby much bigger than most big resorts and here we are talking about a place with just 4 Villas. The Villas are just fantastic facing the pool and facing the lovely green forested valley in front. \n\nThe room besides the excellent artworks had things like a Copper Bath Tub (yes actual Copper), Copper Wash Basins, Batik linens and an Entertainment system with an Amplifier and Roof mounted speakers for a surround effect. These are just a few of things I noticed and I dont recollect such things in any other room that I have ever stayed at.\n\nAnd of course the Hospitality was par excellence and the people around were impeccable when it came to service whether it was moving our luggage to our room or arranging our Airport drop.\n\nThe fact that there are just 4 Villas makes it the ideal place if peace and quiet are what you are looking for. Perfect for Honeymooners. And if you need to be in the hustle and bustle Ubud Market is just a few kms away and the shuttle gets you there in 10 minutes.\n\nAll in all a perfect place. Can hardly wait to visit this Gem of Ubud again.",

              "text": "As per other reviews, Pandawas was absolutely divine. It engages all of the senses to provide a continuous and effortless sense of meditation and healing.\nFrom the first minute that you step through the gates, you are greeted with tranquility and peace. Surrounded by forest, sounds of nature, crystal clear pool and amazing rooms; this is the perfect place to relax and unwind.\nWhat tips this place over to create the perfect holiday is the amazing staff. With constant positivity, smiles and a willingness to do anything to make your holiday perfect. The staff could always be approached and were never too busy to talk or help out, whether this is driving you into Ubud or organising and taking you on tailored day trips. In particular, we got to know and were very fond of both Wyan's who work at Pandawas. They were both so kind and considerate, ensuring that they made our stay perfect, stress free, relaxing and exciting all at once. We found that the kindness and appreciation for what the staff did for us was given back to us ten-fold.\nHighly recommend Pandawas for your next visit to Ubud (although, I would love to keep it all to myself, but this place needs to be shared!)\nBy the end of our stay we felt so welcome that it became a home away from home. We didn't want to leave.",

YThree unique experiences that are usually never experienced at one location...except Pandawas villas in ubud. From the moment we arrived we were blown away by the location. Set in busy ubud yet surrounded by nature at its finest. We were greeted by the most professional and well mannered staff we have experienced in all our travels. Our accommodations were nothing short of 5 star luxury in true balinese villa style. Beautifully carved high ceilings, ample room space and wardrobes, with an amazing outdoor bathroom which was an experience of its own. The meals prepared at the villas were fresh and extremely appetising as all ingredients are either grown and sourced in the grounds gardens or locally sourced from fresh markets and farms only hours before the meal. The staff was extremely helpful in planning out our stay in Bali, and booked all attractions for us with transportation arranged. We felt truly pampered for the 6 days we stayed there. \nA highly recommended location for anyone visiting Bali. Will be back ourselves very soon!",

Beautiful, peaceful, serene perfection!\n\nThe beauty is all in the detail of this tranquil paradise, consisting of only four villas it feels like your own private resort. The staff are permanently smiling and always going out of their way to make your stay feel special. The rooms themselves are so open and spacious, with plenty of storage space and the outdoor bathroom was so nice and unique. \n\nThe infinity pool looks out onto the Ubud forestry and fields and truly is a breathtaking view. It was such a nice place to relax and unwind. I would highly recommend staying here to get some peace and quiet from the hustle and bustle you will find everywhere else. \n\nThe villas are located close to central Ubud and the staff are very helpful at providing recommendations and activities. \n\nThe photos don't do justice to how beautiful Pandawas Villas is!",

As the Villas are surrounded by greenery, and overlooks the forest, it felt like the perfect place to relax and refresh. The staff were friendly and welcoming and made us feel comfortable from the moment we entered. The room was spacious with large wardrobes. It was beautifully furnished with local art work, which added to the  ambience of the place. We loved the open bathroom and the kids loved the net covered beds that were made for them. The villas are about 15 mins from Ubud centre, with plenty of local Craft shops along on the way. The food was delicious, the kids relished the banana pancakes as we did with our omelettes. I truly felt relaxed and calm and will definitely love to go back again!",

I could wake up every morning with the chirping of birds and meditate overlooking a beautiful green valley below.\n\nThe service is fantastic and the staff warm and caring. The villas are large, comfortable and tastelly done with local decor and architectural style. All in all my best experience and favorite place in Ubud.",

There are only four villas in the complex which results in the setting being very peaceful.  The villa is well appointed with a huge internal area and outdoor bathroom.  There is a beautiful pool overlooking the rain forest, as well as a large living/dining area and TV room.  \n\nBreakfast was good each morning, though the options could do with a spruce up. There is also the option of pre-ordering dinner to have at home (noting there are no restaurants an easy stroll away). \n\nThere are three shuttles to Ubud and back each day, otherwise it costs around IDR70,000 to get there.  This is convenient, though, given the size of the complex, it would be nice if there were more flexibility in the times.\n\nThe only issue encountered was a power outage at night that lasted for a few hours and made the room uncomfortable, though this is commonplace in SE Asia.\n\nI would recommend staying here if you don't mind being out of town and, particularly, if you have a group of 6 to 8 and can hire the entire complex.\n\nOverall very good.",

We shall definitely take your advice on making the shuttle timings more flexible - since its a shuttle service sometimes other guests do not want to wait. \r\n\r\nWe are once again sorry about the electricity outage that one night - the MCP at the main plant caught fire and therefore the electricity in our area kept fluctuating. Even though we operate the generator - the fluctuations and irratic electricity flow that night - were a bother. Please allow us to make it up to you on your return to the property. \r\n\r\nWe look forward to meeting you again. \r\n\r\nkind regards\r\nPandawas Management Team",

Our room was spacious and comfortable with a lovely outdoor bathroom and a shady deck overlooking the pool.\n\nThe staff were lovely - friendly and very helpful.\n\nThe hotel is located about 10 minutes drive outside Ubud on a lovely quiet, windy road through jungle and rice fields. There are not many hotels and there is a small village further past Pandewas. We  loved it as we found Ubud very busy and wanted a quieter Bali experience - Pandewas delivered on this!\n\nWe would definitely stay at Pandewas again next time we visit Ubud.",

We ended up spending most of our time at the hotel-- because it was as if we had our own private resort!  Definitely recommend the room on the end with the view.  The rooms are huge, and everything is beautifully decorated.  We enjoyed the beautiful pool, having a massage on the deck, sipping mango lassies in the shade, could not ask for much more.  The food was excellent as well.  The actual resort is close to Ubud but far enough away you feel like you are in your own private villa- surrounded by trees. Would definitely stay there again!",

In fact, because there are only 4 villas, it's more private than other locations that cost a lot more; we were often the only people on site and in the pool. We were also the most fortunate to reserve THE BEST room in Nakula with a wall of windows overlooking the forest right next to the bed. The staff is very friendly and the food was very tasty. The decor pops with beautiful art and architecture. The grounds are also just next to a rice field. You can also walk up hill about 10-15 minutes and check out a small local village (Kepitu?). The only cons, which are by far outweighed by all the pros, are the toilet seat needs to be changed, the complimentary shuttle only runs a few times per day, and the food is expensive. (If you want a change of scenery and food, you can walk 5 minutes up hill to The Kayon, which had only opened for business 3 days upon our arrival.) And for romance, definitely take a bath! Overall, if you want to experience a slice of heaven, visit Pandawas and you will be in a dream...",

              "text": "YES, IT CERTAINLY WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE TO ENJOY OUR HOLIDAY AT 'THE Pandawas Villas, Ubud, Bali\n\nWe were surfing for information about suitable Villas in Bali; and suddenly, as a matter of good luck we happened to get in touch with our Australian Friendly couple who had gone for a holiday some time back.  It was they who strongly recommended us the place - The Pandavas Villas at Ubud, Bali. Having full faith in their recommendation we booked ourselves to spend our holiday.  This was our first visit to Bali and we had gathered some information about the Indonesian Island, which is known for its ancient Hindu Culture.\n\nWe were indeed wonder struck when we checked at The Pandavas Villas.  They had arranged for us transport to pick us up from the airport.  We have already visited many countries - United States, Switzerland, France, Hongkong, Singapore, Malaysia, and stayed in the Hotels & villas there.  But the experience we gathered and enjoyed at the Pandavas Villas was so much unique that it has inspired us to share it for the benefit of many around the world who we do not know; but would be glad if they also experience the same enjoyment as we did.\n\nThe Pandavas Villas is a self-contained resort with Five suites, a private swimming pool, two massage cottages and in-house dining facility.  The suites are of the same size - sprawling, with huge bathrooms attached and kind size twin beds with all other five-star facilities.  But the experience of staying there gave us a feeling as if we were in a small palace in a thick jungle, & very well protected.  Enjoying the swimming pool just outside our suite any time of the day was an experience which we had never enjoyed anywhere else.  The linen provided was extremely comfortable and clean.  But for our return bookings done in advance and our commitments back home, we would have been too pleased to extend our stay there for a few days more; but unfortunately it was not be so. I saw a lot of young and senior citizens like us have an equally enjoyable time.\n\n We shall treasure with us the memory of our stay at The Pandavas Villas for a long time and may be, not too far in the future, we shall visit Bali again for a slightly longer holiday and refresh our pleasant memories of enjoying the stay at The Pandavas Villas once again.\n\nMaya & Prem Gandhi\n\nNew Delhi \nIndia",

On arrival after 20 hours in transit from South Africa we were very tired and what a welcome it was to arrive at Pandawas. \nOur late arrival due to a missed connection was accommodated without a glitch and Wayan waited for us with a friendly smile at the airport. \nIn my opinion the internet pictures don't begin to do justice to the lovely setting - it truly is beautiful, quiet and peaceful. We checked into Nakula villa and were very comfortable there. The room size is enourmous and ample for a family of four.\nOur daily breakfast was large and delicious.\nWifi reception was excellent everywhere on the grounds and in our room - something we struggled with further on in our travels at other establishments.\nOne might find many places to stay in Ubud with a beautiful setting and lovely rooms and grounds, but what must set Pandawas Villas apart is certainly the wonderful staff - Wayan Muliawan, Ani, Kadek and Wayan Tirta. They were friendly, accommodating and amazing with the kids. There were many more groundskeepers and kitchen staff that we didn't interact with that must have worked equally hard as the food was excellent and the grounds well-kept.\nIf I come back to Ubud, I am definitely coming back here!",

The hotel staff were extremely helpful and went out of their way to ensure we had an enjoyable stay.\nThe location of the Villa is such that it is on a hill and right in the middle of forest like area and you can appreciate the privacy and close contact with nature. From the time you are collected from the airport, it's just all so refined and hassle free. From the second we arrived, we were treated like royalty, and the greeting involved a little cultural touch as well. The surroundings of this resort are breath taking, and the employees were very professional and friendly. \nThe rooms are really big and well maintained and so are the attached bathrooms. To keep with the ethos of the location, the villa is very eco-friendly with no use of plastic at all.Even in the bathroom the toiletries are in pottery containers. The concept of open bathroom follows the typical Balinese tradition. All the 4 rooms face a beautiful pool. The Buddy's bar was further up a few steps from the rooms....and the view of the forest and small paddy fields was AMAZZZING....!!!!\nThe ingredients used for cooking are organic. Food is served in a huge room open on two sides and facing the pool and never did we use the fans because there was nice breeze all day.\nThere is shuttle which takes you to Ubud market and picks you back at specific times.That was a great plus.\nThe environment is calm and serene and all you can hear during the day is chirping of birds. While there is a lot you can do in Ubud, but next time I am there I would want to spend at least two full days just enjoying and relaxing in the property. I thought Bali would be a one time visit, but this property is coaxing me to plan another holiday there.\nYou can't miss this opportunity if you are in Bali.",

Although all mod cons are available (tv and wifi) the very special environment made us switch off from modern society. The staff were superb and take such care and pride of the villas and grounds.  The shuttle into ubud was very convenient too. Didn't want to leave! Will definitely recommend and will return. ",

A nice outdoor bathroom, and the pool was just few steps away from the bedroom. \nEven though there were other guests in the villa, we still had our privacy since the common area were spacious, it was really good especially for the kids.\nThe staffs were very helpful and friendly, they had a shuttle car which could drop us to central Ubud every a couple hours. The breakfast set menu had many options and they were delicious.The downside was the internet was not working well, but it was not a big issue since we were on holiday. In the nutshell, it was a great holiday experience. Would love to come back soon!",

The dinner meal was fresh and well presented. Guests can sit in the entertainment room - also called Krishna room - and watch your favorite shows. \n\nThe bedrooms are spacious and beautifully decorated. So much care has been taken to make guests feel welcome. The world plugs are there in every corner of the room. The mattresses and pillows were very comfortable,  I had an amazing sleep. Awoke in the morning feeling so fresh. \n\nThank you Pandawas Team for making my stay so memorable. I shall definitely come back",

Functional kitchen and a bar add up to giving you everything that one would need for a short stay - a home away from home - just have to experience it!",

The villa is unlike your standard hotel, it have less than half a dozen rooms which means the service is very personalized and the place is very quite & private. The room is huge and have plenty to offer. Highly recommended for families, groups or even just couples who want to find a secluded place. The villa is very value for money for the standard of service and experience. Location is quite ideal. If you're looking for a gate away, far from the commotion of Bali, privacy, value for money and high standard of quality.. this is the place to go to. Two thumbs up!",

It was a very friendly and homely atmosphere and the staff were very accommodating. Breakfasts were well prepared and flavoursome, and well sized. The location for us was great as it's not actually in ubud centre, which means you're away from the noise and crowds of the centre,  but this might not suit all. Saying that, they provide a free shuttle service several times a day to make sure that you are not missing out on anything; it's acgually quite close to the centre. \n\nThe rooms are big and clean,  and the bathroom is quite interesting and exciting. They provided us with a baby cot, which was in good working order, and it was free of charge. The kids playroom is well stocked, and our eldest enjoyed feeding the fish. The pool is really nice, and suitable for adults and children. \n\nWe loved this place and wouldn't hesitate in returning or reccommending.\n\nThank you Pandawas Villas, and thank you to the staff for making our stay enjoyable.",

The bedrooms, well maintained, spacious, enough to fit a family of four. You can't  help but loose track of time in its peaceful surrounding. It gives you a back to nature feel with its lush greenery, pond filled fishes and not to forget the outdoor activities your kids could do, including the outdoor pool and fun filled activities such as riding on the ATV which the staff gladly organized for us, The food so fresh and yummy, my special favorites are their croissants and the chocolate flavor gelato ice cream. With such pleasant staff members the service we had was great. No complains, Its one destination my family and I visit every time we are in Bali. Until we meet again kudos Pandawas.",

Its almost like a private villa with staff on hand so you don't have to lift a finger. At times during our 10 night stay we were the only guests and had the place all to ourselves. The villa is very well considered and very child friendly, unlike other Ubud resorts. The owner also has a young child. Our two year old was in her element and all the staff adored her, showering her with attention and watching over her for us so we could read books and relax. The grounds are stunning with multiple Koi ponds and places to explore. A highlight was breakfast on top of the tower overlooking the rice paddies each day. We also loved the huge copper outdoor bath and most nights the whole family would lie in it under the stars. Food was good but a little repetitive after 10 nights but for a shorter stay it would be great. Free meals for kids under 3 was a welcome bonus. Meals were made to order when we wanted which adds to the home away from home feel. We only ventured out on a few occasions for dinner as believe me, you will want to savour every moment at Pandawas! Thanks to the owners, who were here for a few days, for making us feel so welcome and for the care and attention to detail they take to make the place so special.",

Although the children had matresses on the floor they were very comfy and they did not mind.\nThe pool!!!!!! Wow we spent hours swimming with the kids and after they went to bed my husband and I could relax with our drinks overlooking the lush rainforest.\nThe service was impeccable and the food was delicious.\nYou would never know that the hotel was \"full\" it was so quiet!!!\nThe staff organized wonderful activities for us like the mountain bike ride through the village, the amazing massages by the local girls and the wonderful babysitter to look after the kids while we had dinner in the village.\nWe will definatly be back soon",

Food continues to be great, staff is cheerful and helpful and of course the location and the villas enthrall you. My son loves the setting : variety of games indoor  and for outdoor  a lot of open space with activities like swimming, gardening, kite flying. The staff is attentive and smart to be vigilant yet non interfering. Kids love it :)  We got good recommendations on places to visit and restaurants to eat in. A must do for a family, if you get the chance.",

Having been told about it, I did expect a beautiful venue, but no word could actually fully describe this realization. The amount of work and planning that made possible the creation of this place in the middle of what was probably once only field and jungle is just grand. Pandawas Villas is a truly beautiful environment, tastefully decorated with an attention to detail that is amazing. From the very basics (for ex: every waste basket in our villa being unique and beautiful items), to the totally unexpected (ability to plug in an ipod under the gazebo overlooking the rice fields), spacious private space, quality bedding and discreet service, this is a gem of a place and one can immediately see it has been conceived with heart and soul. A unique experience",

From being greeted at the airport with a cool face towel and a cold beverage, to the incredible freshly prepared meals each day, to the unbelievable hospitality, friendliness and kindness of the Villa staff, I was treated like a queen the entire time.  For those that are looking for a true cultural \"treat\", I would highly recommend this place.  Nestled in the hills amongst the rice fields, this was a perfect place to relax and rejuvinate.  The rooms were elegant but simple, the bathroom and copper tub was truly unique.  For those who truly appreciate the finer things in life, this place is truly an experience in the devine.  A very special place.",

There are just four villas around the pool each of which provides spacious and comfortable accommodation with a wow factor built in.  There are extensive grounds on the property and a number of intimate locations where you can take breakfast or dinner.  Overall the property has been carefully designed to engender a feeling of tranquility, it would be very hard indeed not to relax completely here.\n\nThe staff are very freindly and helpful, I had the impression that it really mattered to them that you got just what you wanted.  We only took dinner in the hotel once but on that occasion we were impressed with the simple and good food served, the ingredients for which were sourced from the market that day. \n\nI'd give this place the highest recommendation, one of the top half dozen places I have stayed.",

When we arrived i was amazed! we could not see much as it was so dark but the lights that lined the pathway were lined with flowers. We were then given DELICIOUS welcome drinks and shown to our room which was fantastic, there was a beautiful king size bed with patterened batik and two comfy single beds for the kids. when we woke up the next morning the view from our villa was spectacular. imagine opening the door and sitting on the porch overlooking the rainforest and tranquil infinity edge pool while the sun is rising. The next few days were some of the most relaxing days i've ever had. Some days we stayed at the villa and just chilled in the pool or had a massage other days we went on elephant safari's and bike rided through local villages.\n So thank you pandawas villa's we will be back soon!!!!!!",

We had 3 out of the 4 villas for ourselves so almost the entire property was ours. It is set on 2 acres of land with lush landscaped gardens! Water features, koi pond, gardens, buddy's bar, Arjuna bar and more! Food was organic and freshly prepared!\n\nEach and every room is unique and has different theme to it - inspired from the Hindu Epic Mahabharta!\n\nWe would love to return back to this property again and again! Highly recommended for business, leisure and even just a family getaway!\n\nService of the staff was immaculate! We love Bali and we love Pandawas!",

All the rooms are very spacious and well decorated.  Kids had a blast - custom menus, toys in the pool and activities to keep them engaged - kite flying, gardening, fish feeding and an entertainment room.  It was my parents first visit to Bali and the underlying research around the Pandavas from Mahabharata epic was fully cherished.  Their comments in the guest book says it all - this (re)visit was beyond perfection!!",

              "text": "This is a perfect location for a family with young children.  The playroom is well equipped with toys (the owners have young children).  The staff soon know the children's names and address them by this during the stay, fussing over them and making them feel very special. The kitchen accomodated our off menu requests for childs meals.  They arranged for my daughter to be dressed in local costum with full flower and golden crown headress which she loved.\n\nFor the parents the villa is total 5 star luxury without the snootyness that equivalent hotels include.  The very spacious rooms and common area are beautiful; a combination of tasteful design and carefully selected ornaments/paintings. \n\nThe pool is a good size with overhanging trees dropping yellow and white flowers into the water and lined on one side with banana trees.  Two smaller childrens pool areas are part of the overall pool.\n\nThe bar overlooking the surrounding paddy fields is a perfect spot to unwind at the of the day.\n\nVilla Pandawas is laid out following the rules of balinese designs with temple in the north east corner and sleeping areas east and west.  As you enter the walled villa compound you immediately feel at peace.\n\nOn the final day the staf invited us to join them for morning prayers in the villa temple which was very special and something we will always remember.\n\nThe staff makes this an incredible place to stay and I highly recommend this villa to anyone.",

From the first greeting we had at reception, the architecture of the villa \u2013 which is beautifully designed and decorated, the room setting with amazingly sound system, the organic toiletries, the entertainment system that kept our son occupied, till to our farewell, it exceeded all our expectations. \nThis is not \u201cjust\u201d a villa. This is more like living in your very good friend\u2019s private and exclusive home sweet home with all the luxuries he can offer you, added with relaxing environment that gives you peaceful mind at a different level. \nI will take back home with me the amazing time we had here and when times are tough let the memory of this wonderful place wash over me and put life in perspective. \nBig thankyou Pandawas and your fantastic staff for a time we will always remember. \n(Herrie.

We were there on the first anniversary of their opening on January 29th and were delighted to share in a small ceremony with the staff to celebrate this.  We were presented with a cake on our own anniversary and had a great tour around some of the local villages with two of the staff on their motorbikes.  The food was great and the chef very happily responded to specific meal requests.  The villas were well-equipped, roomy and comfortable.  The free wireless internet worked well.  The location is quiet and peaceful but only about 15 minutes from Ubud with all its restaurants and galleries.  Pandawas is a 5 Star resort in every respect.",

The setting is heavenly and the service surpasses all your expectations. The staff went out of their way to make sure our stay was comfortable. I especially fell in love with the architecture of the villa, it is beautifully decorated, showcasing the best of Bali. Everything, and yes everything, from the food to the toiletries to even the mosquito repellant is organic!! It was also perfectly located to explore the hustle bustle of cultural ubud with the centre of the city less than ten minutes away. The attention to detail was unlike anything I have seen before - there was a bottle sterilizer, bottle drying rack in addition to the baby cot for our nine month old. The staff even babysat her while we enjoyed the sumptuous breakfast outdoors at Buddy's bar with a view of the lush paddy fields! I was told that they are soon going to start selling some of their products online, I cant wait!! Oh, dont forget to ask the staff for restaurant recommendations, we loved every bit of what we tried. Dream vacation - Big thank you Pandawas!",

The rooms, facilities, food, staff, were outstanding.  This place is away from the city center but the car service worked great for us when we wanted to shop or eat in the city (but mostly ate at the hotel restaurant as they will cook pretty much anything you want!).  Very upscale and relaxing environment with just some amazing luxurious features.  Really not a \"hotel\" experience, more like living in someone's very exclusive personal home with all the luxuries you can imagine. \n- Traveler recently relocated to Singapore from the US.",

We had the misfortune of having bad weather conditions the entire time of our stay (3nights), and it was indeed a blessing that Pandawas is a lovely place to hole-up in!  The entertainment system kept my teenagers occupied, while the playroom kept my 6yr old busy!  Bad weather also meant dining in, and it was again a pleasure that the food was great!  Most importantly, the staff are wonderful!  They are most helpful, yet discreet.  You can't help feeling that the place is your own private property!  If you are looking for a great place to unwind and relax, this is the place to be!  And don't miss the massage in an open pavillion near the pool!  Being serenaded by cicadas is also a bonus!",

Set away from the crowds with lush green cover all around, this was a perfect setting for a very relaxing holiday.  Pandawas is everything the photos depict and much more.  Named after the 5 Pandawa brothers from the epic Mahabarata, the rooms have been planned with meticulous detailing.  The bathrooms are pieces of art!! The copper bath tub is open to the sky, and it comes stocked with toiletries!\n\nThe pool is amazing and clean, and the kids room is very well stocked with toys, games, books and DVDs, My 2 children aged 7 and 3, did not want to leave the villa!! The staff are amazingly warm and helped us plan out itineray that were child friendly!!!!! The food was delicious and is made fresh, so orders need to be placed in advance. They have their own small kitchen garden and herbs corner, from which they source most of their kitchen requirements.  The bread is made fresh every morning and I would recommend their bread basket to everyone staying there!! \n\nThere is a small temple within the villa, and offerings are made every morning.  The buddies bar is another highlight and should not be missed. \n\nThanks to the warmth showed by the owner, Mrs. Monica and her wonderful staff, especially Nita and Kedai, my family and I had a wonderful holiday in Bali!",

I spent three days there with my wife, and I doubt we shall ever experience such a wonderful and relaxing place again in our lives - unless we return!\nIt's difficult to know what to praise most.  Surrounded by the tranquility of nature, each of the four villas - yes, just four - share undreamt-of private and shared spaces, all in the traditional Balinese architectural style with high ceilings that makes the climate most pleasant. \nThe service is impeccable, discreet and always available;  there is no pressure of having to get to breakfast by 10am, as you can have anything you wish, prepared or cooked to order, whenever you like.  The luxury of this lack of pressure of time is incalculable.\nWe wanted to retreat in order to relax, but also to think creatively.  Our busy minds found no difficulty in continuing to function effectively without distraction, so our creative thinking was not compromised.  But when it came to relaxing, all our ambitions to leave the villas to explore the island.... somehow just didn't seem necessary, or more important than just staying around in the spacious grounds, relaxing, or swimming in the magnificent infinity pool.\nIt obviously comes at a price.  But if time and relaxation are at a premium for you, this could be one of the most inspired and memorable choices you could make.",

Nestled amongst the birdlife and jungle-green of outer-ubud (10-15 mins away from centre), the villas couldn't have been a more perfect change of pace and scene for our family of 2 young children plus 'grandma'. The pool was a perfectly designed space for the children and adults alike, the suites were spacious, air-conditioned and with proper, high-quality mattresses, even the kids' beds were of superior quality! The bathrooms are just like in the photos; one of my favourite spots of the villas in fact. And the best, best part was the warm, family-like nature of each of the staff. Each of them were so gentle, generous and kind with such an easy manner with the children. I would look forward to seeing each of them after a day outside; it truly was a pleasure to return to the embracing arms of the villa and the staff. Highlight was motorbiking with some of the staff through the neigbouring rice paddies and local villages. I will definitely come again; already can't wait.",

Everything was to a very high standard and it was an experience I hope we will repeat again.  \nWe cannot recommend it highly enough.  From the attentiveness of the staff, the high standard and variety of cuisine, to the cleanliness and general peacefulness of this lovely place it is simply paradise on earth.  It is the perfect venue for honeymooning, family celebrations, or just as a relaxing place to chill out.  When we first arrived we intended to go out and visit as much of Bali as we could, but the plan soon changed as we simply relaxed and enjoyed being this delightful haven.",

In particular we remember the coconut/lime drinks sitting by the bar, taking in the lovely view. My husband and I had a wonderful 4 days stay in June 2010.  It was like being taken care of by friends, we left feeling relaxed and throughly spoiled.",

The staff was outstanding; the pool is built right up to the jungle and the outdoor bathrooms are truly one of a kind. My husband and I  celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary on July 27th. A member of the hotel staff performed a traditional Balinese ceremony in the on-site temple. It was so special for us. \nMy children played in the game room (play station and games) while we had a couples massage. This is one of the best properties in the world-truly! There are iPod stations in the rooms and surround sound speakers. They provided organic soaps, organic scrubs, and organic mosquito spray made especially for Pandawas. We hired a driver from their staff each day who drove us around Ubud. This hotel is better than any other in Ubud.",

The best feature for us, was the open reception / dining area. \n\nWe were surrounded by greenery and water and with a cocktail in hand...that\u2019s pretty much holiday perfection!\u2028\u2028 We enjoyed the food immensely. The buffets offered us the best flavours of Bali and Indonesia. The kids were happy with the toys and painting but their favourite pastime was feeding the fish with the staff. \u2028\u2028The staff was very friendly, helpful and willing to go out of the way to help. They make excellent baby sitters too!\u2028\u2028\n\nOverall, highly recommended to anyone who wants a luxurious stay in Ubud, Bali.",

We stayed at the villa with my wife's parents, 2 young children and a nanny -- we had the entire property for ourselves for 4 nights!!!  Due to its stunning architectural design and decor, Pandawas took us back in time and left us thoroughly delighted.  With an expansive pool, large rooms, unique layout -- made it a 'gem' of a resort, the perfect home for a perfect vacation.  The amenities (music system, WiFi, flat screen TVs, a full media entertainment room for kids activities) made our stay very enjoyable.  This was so much in contrast to any hotel experience we have had.  The food menu was 'customized' to our choice and everything was prepared 'fresh'.  The incredibly friendly staff showed personal care in every aspect of our stay.  This was certainly THE place to detox completely and simply chill!!",

You feel that sense of arrival which simply releases all the burdens of the mortal world. You transform into royalty, with the level of service accorded, the vast spaces of the villas and the tranquil pool side hugged by the surrounding forest. Here in the mountains of Ubud, you are in the ultimate realm which makes one feel almost godlike. \n\nIt's hard to leave Pandawas and face reality again.\n\nThanks for the surreal experience!!!!",

Serenity, solitude and service are words that perfectly describe what my friends and I experienced at the resort.  In fact, we had the resort all to ourselves!  With only 4 beautifully-furnished villas for guests, we got the privacy we needed.  The minute we walked into the resort\u2019s receiving area, we were given cold towels and welcome drinks which were surprising treats especially after a long drive.  But the surprise did not end there, we were awed not only by the elegant, minimalist furnishings at the main common area but also by the wide open space right before us \u2013 high ceiling and no walls which afforded us with the perfect view of the pool and greenery which we lack in the city.  The villas were very grand and impressive with very nice color motifs and furnishings.  There was just so much space and yet the atmosphere was so much like home!  A where you have a pond just outside your room/villa, an entertainment room, a stylish bar, a nice relaxing pool, and a hilltop hut where you can enjoy starry evenings.  Of course, Pandawas wouldn\u2019t be \u201chome\u201d without its friendly, professional and very efficient staff.  In fact, everything we requested for were given and arranged for us, including a birthday cake for our friend who celebrated his birthday at the resort.  Not to be outdone by any other resort, the food was amazingly delicious!  The best Balinese dishes I\u2019ve ever tasted.  We always had a feast prepared for us.  It\u2019s home away from home.",

I am so glad that the staff helped us take care of our children.  The place is just perfect for relaxation, very private and very peaceful.  I was able to de stress even though I was with my 3 kids!!!  Service was really good.  Food was superb from breakfast to dinner. But what I truly crave for is the non traditional pancakes in the morning, with fresh fruits and the refreshing watermelon juice. The rooms are enormous, beautiful, very well designed, with state of the art entertainment system,  I was totally bewitched by this place.  \nI went back to Pandawas with my husband and friends.  Love is truly lovelier the 2nd time around. I became more in love with this place! I just can't stop admiring it's beauty and peacefulness.

Whether it is the sunny morning or the clouds are at play, each view is more spectacular than the other.\nThe rooms are very tastefully done and carefully thought thru.\nGreat stuff to have a lounge / entertainment room separate with a wonderful sound system and great for watching movies or playing games.\nThe bar which was on a perch was absolutely fantastic according to me. Great place to unwind, have a drink and watch the moon light in the open.\nStaff were extremely user friendly but then that is typical of balinese culture.\nOverall a very luxurious and relaxing experience.",

We were pampered and treated with gentle, friendly care from the minute we were picked up from the airport until we were dropped off again 4 days later.   We really just wanted to relax and have no set schedule for anything, and the staff really did a superb job of being there whenever WE needed them.  Ubud is just a quick ride away and is a great place to soak in the culture of Bali.  We also did a day trip around Bali to take in the sights, but mostly we just lounged at the Villas and enjoyed the pool and gorgeous sunsets.  The staff was very accommodating;  we enjoyed the delicious, freshly prepared food and cocktails during the entire stay.  I can't wait to go back and get another poolside massage, enjoy the beautiful outdoor soaking tubs, and do some Yoga!",

Since then I have come to Ayurvedagram many times to experience the wonderness that it has to provide. Ayurvedagram was pivotal in my journey to improved health and well being and is a place very close to my heart. \n\nI was so excited to hear that Ayurvedagram was coming to Bali and came as soon as I could. The experience which I have had here has been wholesome and enlightening. \n\nSet in the beautiful and spiritual Ubud, the grounds are beautiful, serene, peaceful and there is a spiritual ambiance that welcomes you as you arrive. \n\nThe beauty of Ayurvedagram here at Bali are not just its surroundings but the people and is also one of the reasons I was pulled to come here to Bali. The staff including Monica the founder ,Dr Natasha, the therapists, Yoga Master, Kitchen staff, receptionist and maintenance staff have been so welcoming, caring and kind and go beyond the call to make your wellness journey here a holistic experience. \n\nI have not only gained good wellbeing but knowledge and inspiration for better physical and mental health. Thank you to everyone here at Ayurvedagram Bali for their hospitality and I wish them all the best in bringing the principles of Ayurveda to many more guests in the years to come. \n\nI would highly recommend making a visit to Ayurvedagram Bali you will not regret it!",

The treatments were amazing - authentic Ayurvedic massage and steam, by two experienced therapists, from India. Dr. Natasha the in residence highly trained Ayurvedic doctor did a professional and caring full health consultation. The food follows strict vegan Ayurvedic traditions using local homegrown  produce as one would expect in a Ayurvedic wellness and treatment centre. Do not expect typical hotel restaurant menu. Try the meditation with the rice paddy view - I just drifted off into deep relaxation. This is a place to seek genuine Ayurvedic treatment in Bali, it is a wellness centre for time out, reflection, yoga, meditation and self care.",

So, when I heard about Ayurvedagram Bali, I decided to go there and have a 5 day \"test run\".\n\nA resort itself is Amazing. It is located just outside of Ubud in the quiet and peaceful area surrounded by a jungle. Accommodation choice varies between newly built Suites with shared swimming pools and villas with jungle views.\n\nAurveda program itself was really enjoyable and rejuvenating. A team of experienced professionals (a doctor, therapists etc.) were making sure that everything was running smoothly and all aspects taken care for. Typical daily program included 2 therapies, 3 Yoga/Meditation sessions, walking exercise and 3 healthy meals per day.\n\nI enjoyed my visit so much, that I have already booked my next 14-day retreat :-) Highly recommended!",

              "text": "Review for Pandawa Villas \n\nThe experience of staying at the Pandava Villas( Ayurvedagram ) was miserable to say the least. We had given advance notice via our agent regarding the food and it\u2019s in a remote location and there\u2019s a child in the family, one person has a leg injury and one person has a heart problem, we were told food will be provided and there\u2019s a menu and everything and you may order ala carte and upon reaching there, there were three items for breakfast, nothing for lunch, and two items for dinner for which you have to specially order at least 2 hours before and not even worth half their price. Whenever we found an issue, their excuse to everything to was, we just opened after 3 years. Their management is a joke, the staff was very friendly and helping us to the best of their ability, but having such an untrained management they could only do so much. \nThe room service was acceptable but not worth paying this much money. \nThey call themselves a 5 star hotel/resort but the services are below what you get in a 1 star hotel. They charge money you pay for a 7 star resort and give mediocre services. \nThey have no car service and mind you the resort is on a slope and has a slopey road before also, on our first day we waited for 2 hours after placing order on the grabb app yet our order wasn\u2019t confirmed as the location is in a remote place and we asked for a car and they said nobody is available. \nNow the nearest marketplace was 30 minutes away via car costing 100 dollars in coming and going return fare and that\u2019s less than half the price of food we could\u2019ve ordered. \nThis is the first time in my life I\u2019ve had to fight them to give us a couple of omelets and fried rice for dinner in a 5 star hotel for dinner because my sister (11y) hadn\u2019t eaten anything in a couple of hours due to visa process at airport, 2.5 hours of traffics then checking in and then waiting another 2 hours figuring out how to get food. \nThe worst experience at this resort, my personal suggestion is don\u2019t even come to close to this resort.",

You and your spouse are delibrately defaming the property as you wanted more and more freebies and the team refused to you give you more things. Lets get the chronology correct:\n1. you wanted heavy discounts from the room rate- you got that. \n2. your agent explained to you that only bed and breakfast can be offered. you agreed to that. \n3. you knew you will be offered only veg ayuveda food - you were ok with that. it was also going to be simple ayurveda food. you agreed to that. French fries are not part of any ayurveda menu. \n4. if you were so unhappy - you could have checked out after a few hours - you refused to. \n5. you wanted free free - we did offer you foot massage and shoulder massage - we also requested you to check out early with full refund if you were so unhappy as you only wanted non-veg food. you refused to check out. \n6. Distance is measured via google maps - i advice do download and check if a route has traffic or not. You were offered a taxi - you did not want to pay to the taxi people - maybe you should hire a bike. we do not run a taxi service where we can offer you free taxi - if you need a taxi you need to pay. \n7. If you do want more than current service by the team - as we told you many times during your stay - you are most welcome to check out and find a hotel who can understand your demands and complaints and give you all for free. \n8. Bali new year's time is peak season - i presume its the same in your country also - hence time taken will always be more if there is traffic. This should be basic understanding. \n9. Slope - this is Ubud - there are hills - now you are blaming the property because the road made by the government has a slope?  \n10. Before we give replies to more of your lies and disrespect - leg injury and heart problem  - and no one at the property is actually aware of this - the team requested you to check out so many times as they were so tired of your rudeness. Why did you not check out early?  why did you complete your full stay ?  \n\nAgain we requested you many times to check out early. Its very sad for the team to have guests like yourself. \nWe hope you are able to find a hotel where you get happiness and of course who can give you all services you demand at 50% dicounts. \n\nThank you\nkind regards\nManagement Team ",

Staff was very nice \n\nAt the time check in we come to know that swimming pool rooms are not private pools it\u2019s shared between 3-4 rooms.

Fraud 2 \n\nThen with kids hungry we asked hotel to arrange vehicle etc so we can go for dinner outside even after being so tired - they said they can\u2019t arrange - we had literally fight to get eggs and bread for dinner. \nThey have mentioned it\u2019s very near to restaurants is totally a lie - it\u2019s a minimum 25- 30 mins drive and costs 70-100 dollars for a return fare. \nNext day I get a message from Monica , that we had already informed guests etc that they will not serve any lunch and dinner - nothing to eat even French fried weren\u2019t available.

We are however offering bed and breakfast - hence the 50% discount on the rates. You have booked and selected this option and on check in again this was informed. However we see your expectation despite the 50% discount on the rate was much much more. \n3. Defaming an employee name on a public site to hide your ill-manners to a team on the ground is highly disrespectful. Hence we have reported you to tripadvisor. \n4. The team told you - if you would like to order they can order dinner as delivery for you from an outside restaurant - or they can prepare a basic meal at the ayurveda kitchen or they can book a car to take you out to a restaurant. You insisted on a simple meal at the property after which you simply kept bad-mouthing the team. \n5. Balinese people are very nice people - if they remain quiet and respectful it does not mean they do not feel hurt at the tone and mannerism you kept using while on the property. \n6. Restaurants are in the range of 5-15 km radius. Its super peak season - we do not know about your country but here in Bali - on peak season there is immense traffic. You can always open google maps and check. We do not need to lie to you about travel time. \n7. Payment for any taxi  - is charge of the taxi. The property can only call a taxi - if you do not want to pay taxi fare on peak season - we are unable to asssit you further. You can always hire a bike. \n8. So a property serving guests is never a fraud - its people like you - who do not want to pay - you want discounts - after that you complain and are rude - and then you leave a poor review. \n\nA point you need to think about - if you were so unhappy why did you check in and continue to stay here? You should have checked out immediately - reported to your agent to talk to us. The main point is - you wanted a heavy discounted stay during peak season despite knowing the reasons for the discount and you use that to claim freebies. \n\nWe do sincerely hope you find happiness in another property and you do not trouble other staff as much as you disrespected the team here. \n\nThank you. \nwith kindest regards\nManagement Team ",

              "text": "Looking forward to a relaxing time at the end of our travels having not been abroad since pandemic. We arrived at 11.30pm to our jungle abode lovely to hear the sounds of insects/toads etc we were shown to our (deluxe first floor room with terrace) room by night porter.\nThe room was fine having recently been refurbished this was evident as fridge had  not been \"unpacked\" or plugged in, protective celaphane still on television, safe not working and no coat hangers to hang clothes on! On the plus side bed was comfortable.\nNo welcome letter from hotel or information about breakfast which is usually customary to welcome guests.\nGot telephoned around 8.30 to ask what we wanted for breakfast choice of omelette, 2 fried egg or pancake various fruit juices or fruit and tea or coffee  so breakfast was basic. It was served in the communal kitchen, in 3 days we were there it appeared we were the only couple to be having breakfast outwith the block booking. I informed the reception lady about the lack of information about the hotel, breakfast etc was not a good first impression to have. We walked to the infinity pool where we were informed by reception we don't have access to it as that part of hotel had been booked out at this  and we had no access to it.\nWhen I asked about restaurant, bar and spa I was informed there was no bar as the hotel was quiet and informed that there was plenty of eating places in Central Ubud approx 20 min by taxi costing 70k each way. Not walkable in dark as no lighting and hotel at bottom of steep hill. Also the spa was not available because the group were utilising restaurant and spa.\nThese are all things that are advertised on various websites as being available at the hotel/villa. This is how we choose our accommodation by reading reviews and info. \nWe decided to check out after 3 nights and find somewhere we could relax with a pool, bar and restaurant on site (which we thought we had at Pandawas) .\nIt was discussed with reception the night before leaving and felt there was no apology for .\n\nThis hotel was not for us!!

My favorite part was the beautiful bathroom.  Indoor/outdoor with a huge stone bathtub and rain shower. We stayed in a pool front room looking across the infinity pool towards the lush jungle. It's hard to believe it's just a few minutes from Central Ubud. The central lounge area is also a great place to relax, play games or enjoy a game of billiards. We were also very happy to see a small library stocked with kids books. \nStaff were friendly and very helpful. \nDefintely hoping to stay here again!",

By chance I was here utterly alone for three days, it was like being a deity. The place is simply beautiful, the facilities are awesome, and if you need something that\u2019s not in house jump on the back of someone\u2019s scooter and venture into ubud. With no agenda at all I did more in two days than I can begin to describe. 10th C temple walking distance, Gorgeous paddi field landscapes, I saw luwak coffee actually coming out of a civet\u2019s bottom, and I saw a thousand egrets Comong in to roost at sunset as we rode along the road beneath them.\n\nTruly awesome place. Don\u2019t bring any of your personal mind problems with you - and if you do be prepared to have it wringed out of you.",

Ifyou have breakfast included, you may choose from 3 different (Continental, american or English) and let them know your choice the night before. There are also a menu for lunch/dinner and is perfect when chilling at the pool/hotel area. \nThe shuttleservice was good and active between 8am-9pm. Just be sure to let them know at least 10-15 mins in advance and they will transport if the car and driver is available ( never had an issue during our 4 days). Shuttle to Ubud  is about 10-30 mins depending on traffic. Also had a wonderful halfday tour with one of the hotel staff (Wayan) where we went for swings (uma pakel) and Tegallalang rice terrace. ",

It was unfortunate and as we shared with you - it was only for half a day. We do offer other packets beyond the basic room packet under which you can access many inclusions. The packet you selected was our most basic packet. Trasnport to the town is via a complimentary shuttle which has set timings. If however you do not want to follow the shuttle timings - then you have to book your own car. \n\nWe try and accommodate all guest requests as far as possible. \n\nkind regards\nPandawas Villas Management Team",

Pandawas has only 4 and very spacious Indonesian villas facing an infinity pool and it is surrounded by a lush jungle. The room was tastefully furnished with Balinese style furniture and had a very unique large outdoor bathroom with a separate shower and a very large copper bathtub where you may well enjoy a relaxing bath under a tropical rain.\nThe staff is almost invisible and they keep the outdoor area always clean.\nBreakfast was discretely brought to us and served at the table in the veranda just outside our villa's door.\nPandawas impressed us the moment we walked in its wonderful lobby area and from that moment it offered a unique sense of total peace. It's menu and offerings are essential and you are not surrounded by 50 staff like in other resorts in Bali and therefore you get total peace to relax and enjoy a good book and recharge your soul and batteries.\nWe are Thankful to the Pandawas staff for having given me, my wife and my 3 years old daughter, the opportunity to truly relax and enjoy the peace away from the rest of this noisy and busy world.",

              "text": "Our drive to Ubud was fascinating, on arrival we were met by Ani and her beautiful smile, Wiyan gave us a welcoming drink with his amazing smile, we were taken to our Villa, so spacious and cool, five steps away from the pool we were full of smiles!\nWiyan No 2 helped us with a driver for a day Katut! Our very own Katut and Bali was at our beckoned call. We arrived at The elephant park, it was amazing, nearly took the attendant with me on my elephant, soo anxious but within minutes I was in my element getting to know Agon, she was beautiful, feeding her afterwards was a real experience as we took fruit from our breakfast we were given HUGE loving hugs from Agon and a baby elephant, sooo gorgeous, I will remember that always. Off to lunch at a restaurant the driver took too, it was fantastic, Next stop was the butterfly park a little diasapointing, we were expecting to be covered in butterflies but sadly not, but we were given an in depth lesson on the life of a butterfly by Katut No 2,.....very annoying to see kids try to grab the butterflies, some succeeded and eventuated in a quicker death for those that predominantly only lives a week. Off to Hot springs temple, this gave me goosebumps, you can opt to be blessed in the hot springs, remember to wear your bathers and take a towel. NeXT stop was the tiered rice fields, amazing walk up and up and up, had a very satisfying coconut drink and carried on, past donation points a plenty,...remember to take your small change, donations here are not voluntary. We managed to find a path down, to another 'donation point' remember you already pay for entry, anyhow had 1000 rupiah or 100,000 with us, we gave the 1000 he was not happy and aggressive but after paying entry and 'donating' our way around we ran out if small money. The last stop was to see a waterfall, after walking the rice fields, we couldn't do the steps down to the base, it would have been very cool in that water and should have taken bathers! So bathers, towel, and change is a requirement on these day trips. Decided against the monkey forest, Katut gave us the option, but we were tired, hot and needed a swim and drink. Guess what?.......that evening we had our own monkeys in the trees above us. Wiyan No 3 showed 'He man' how to open a coconut that He Man harvested in the grounds, resulted in yet another lovely coconut water. Ubud centre has a lot to offer, this time of year isn't too busy, and still quite hot, is it ever cool in Bali? Luuv Ubud!",

You can stay at some other big brand named hotels but where will you get an infinity pool opening to a lush green forest, ultra comfortable 'n clean 'n soft beds, \"live life king-size\" experience, fresh off the tree mangoes and other fresh fruit salads, smoothies, food cooked to perfection, private soothing massages, and a plethora of such peaceful experiences that can't be described in words. We, with out 3 kids aged 12/6/1 yr, stayed here and enjoyed each and every moment thoroughly and peacefully. The best part is that even though surrounded by forest, their infinity pool is very well maintained and very clean with fresh water being recycled throughout the day. You never get a feeling of \"stale\" as you would at any other place. Everything, starting from room, to beds, to pool, to food is all FFRREEESSHHHH and CCLLEEAANN.. From meditation to yoga to personal massages to kids care and play room.. they have everything on the charts... Their huge grand Arjuna bar has some exceptional collection of fine wines and other spirits. They even arranged for an early morning sight seeing with their driver and car (of course at an expense but that too very reasonable in $) who took us at beautiful scenic spots that can only be known to a local.",

              "text": "WOW !  Thats the best way to describe my 3 day trip to Ubud's most pristine getaway - The Pandawa Villas which are built across a 2 acre hillsite property and surrounded 360 degrees by just trees and more trees! My Nakul suite was a huge 125 sq m, done up beautifully with an outdoor spa area which was so inviting... The food served was traditional indonesian with a healthy dash thrown into it - so low on carbs and oils, but high on taste:-) Personal attention to detail in the service throughout, and whenever i would pop out, there would be people discreetly tidying up the place and willing to make it as stress free as possible. Definitely had 2 dozen + people looking after this small but exclusive 4-5 villa property spread across a large tract of naturally landscaped area atop a plateau. A must visit!",

              "text": "This was my second visit to Bali. The first brings back great memories of the villa we stayed in, but this time round the memories are going be something else altogether. What we experienced at Pandawas is closest I have ever got to 'bliss', nirvana.\nWe, my husband and I stayed at Pandawas in the last week of July.  To Ubud, we had dedicated 5 days of our short 10 day break, and it was a tough call, not postponing our flight to Singapore. \n\nThe Pandawas too perhaps would have contended I would say, for Wordsworth\u2019s thoughts, when he was writing, 'I wish I had the time to stand and stare', had he been fortunate to experience it.\n\n 'Pandawas' itself is poetry, - its Mahabharata inspired villa-rooms, the black limestone edged pool, its waters a soft trickle over the ledge into the lush greens of the valley below, the tea table outside my room, made out of a traditional musical drum, the paddy terraced, but a glance uphill, the colossal patio, its weathered flooring, the pure organic papaya juice as orange as the fish in the fish pond next to the Arjuna Bar, the finger licking Indonesian spread, the sound of the wilderness in the stillness of the night and the gentle humm of the birds faraway while being pampered to a traditional Balinese massage in the poolside spa bale.\n\nSo one really needs at least 4 days to experience the 'Pandawas poetry' alone and then think of stepping out to absorb some history and culture around the thriving hub of Ubud, just a stone's throw beyond.\n\nThe villa rooms 4 in number, all equally comfortable and awe inspiring exotic were interestingly named after characters from the Hindu epic Mahabharata - the Pandawa brothers ... Yudhishtra, Bhima, Sahdeva & Nakula while the bar I thought was most appropriately named after the most charismatic of theme, Arjuna.\n\nHere I would like to add that this nirvana experience is owed not just to the Pandawas ambiance, but also to the overwhelmingly warm and hospitable staff. The ever smiling, eager to help Wayan, the driver, Kadek, Ani ... you all made my holiday beautiful. Interestingly when you order a fresh papaya juice, you have to be a little patient and you actually see a staff member run down to their farm in the small valley below, pick a ripe papaya n voila you have fresh organic juice on your table. \n\nI am definitely coming back for more, next time round with my son and friends and their families.\n\nJyoti Singh",

              "text": "It seems like every single facet of Pandawas is geared towards just one thing - to make you feel as comfortable, peaceful and relaxed as you possibly can.\n\nIt starts with Ibu Ani (the receptionist)'s welcoming smile as you walk in the door. And then you gradually take in everything else - the sounds of nature, the open lounge area, the infinity pool that looks out over a forest, the koi fish pond on the side... and you can feel the cares and worries (and the two-hour drive from downtown!) begin to fall away.\n\nNext, you enter your vast bedroom (there are only four rooms in this boutique villa, which explains why there's been no compromise made on space). There's an amazingly soft  king-size bed, a sofa in front of a tv hooked up to a serious sound system, a huge semi-open air bath area, and you think 'ok, this is it, i'm not getting out of here again'.\n\nWhen you do finally rouse yourself to explore further, you come across hidden gems - like the entertainment room, or a second bar area tucked away higher up on the property which gives you a great view of the rice fields next door.\n\nIf there's anything at all that could do with improvement, it's possibly the menu - choice is a bit limited. However, you do have the option of taking the complimentary shuttle car down to Ubud, if you wish.\n\nAll in all, this was the perfect end to our holiday. We left Pandawas with regret, but refreshed and rejuvenated. Next time, we're going to stay much, much longer!",

              "text": "This place offered a most relaxing and fulfilling stay. Unforgettable.\nArriving late evening we were greeted by a quiet solitude and a warm welcome from the staff led by the smiling Kedet. The villas remind me of how the Pandawas would have felt in the solitude of their exile except ours is self imposed!\nThe tranquillity and joy it brings embraces you soon after you arrive. The vast open Arjuna lobby is a lounge cum bar cum dining room and reception. Its vast and has a lot of breeze blowing through it. The pool and the lush green valley beyond are so relaxing that i felt smiles emerging all day.\nThere are only 4 spacious villas and each is large well ordered and furnished. lots of cupboard space, TV and audio systems and nice lounge chairs make your room a competitor for your attention with the Arjuna Lobby. the rooms are named after the other 4 brothers among the Pandawas.\nEven if the rooms are full there is so much space around that no one comes in each others way.\nThey have got convenient set menus but are willing to create meal options. The small and efficient staff adds so much value to the Villas...they are eager to please, anticipate request, are well informed and yet unobtrusive. Keep it up folks!\nThere is a large dining table made of a single piece of wood. it can accommodate 10 or more but the staff ensures privacy even om that When another family was eating there they set up another breakfast spot near the lobby pool and next to the game centre. it was such a lovely quiet place with foliage and birds\nThe view over the valley is lush green and there is a large variety of flora to see.\nIt is not far from Central Ubud and a shuttle helps you to go and come back I did go and visit some Ubud sights but my preference became just staying in and savouring the ambience, the tranquillity and breeze added to bu the impeccable hospitality and service\n\\I compliment the developers for their vision!",

The quiet ambience of the villa was enhanced by softly lit lights in the Arjuna lobby-lush greenery surrounds the lovely pool and the cool breeze from the open surroundings creates a perfect setting for a relaxing break. Delicious Balinese dinner set off our holiday onto a perfect start!  Whether its a balinese meal or a pizza or continental breakfast, the staff whips them up equally delicious on request. We stayed there for 3 nights in a well styled spacious room offering all the modern amenities of a 5-star in the boutique styled resort. Attentive staff who respect your privacy, the open styled beautiful bathroom, a drink in the 'Buddies Bar' offering spectacular views around, freshly plucked coconut, their signature 4-hand massage in a pool-side cabana have all ensured that we will go back to Pandawas for our next holiday in Bali!",

Our kids say it is the best place they have ever visited and we live in Asia and travel a good bit. The place only has four villas, so a nice small boutique type feel. No request is too big and the staff is so friendly. They have beautiful grounds and an amazing pool. You can even get a couples massage outside in the cabana  area. The kids love the Xbox and movie library and feeding the fish is always a hit. You won't regret booking this lovely place, and you can't beat the friendly service and charming villas!",

OUTSTANDING!!!\nLooking for a quiet & individual place, pandawas should be your choice. The 4 villas around the beautiful pool are large and perfectly styled. During two days of our stay we were the only guest but service was still at a very high level. Bathroom outside the villa is also a highlight. Breakfast is also at high level.\nPandawas is just a few minutes outside ubud but the hotel offers a shuttle service to ubud market. Taking a taxi is also very cheap, we've paid 50000 IRD. \n\nWe had great time at pandawas villas, missing nothing. We would definitely come back again!",

              "text": "Pandawas is a lovely private Villa group of 4 located away from the central area of Ubud- One needs transportation given the location of the Villas to be able to enjoy Ubud's dining and tourists attractions.   a shuttle bus does run 3 times a day into the centre of Ubud.\n\nWe stayed there  and for the first few days were the only guests there.\n\nThe management and staff were extremely kind to my son and I during our stay as he required surgery.  (for this we are extremely grateful) The staff are all lovely yet quite casual and relaxed in their approach to service.  They would accommodate any request with a smile.  Whilst language was a barrier often, staff tried their best.  On a number of occasions I sough local knowledge from the staff about places and attractions but found their knowledge to be very limited.  In saying this they would always try and help by doing research or trying to find out about places we had inquired about that we wish to visit.\n \nI found that not having room service available 24/7 was often impractical and the available menu at Pandawas was relatively expensive when I compared it to the next hotel we stayed at being Komoneka Bisma which management organised on our behalf and we were so happy with this wonderful recommendation.\n\nThere is no fitness center obviously as it is a very small private Villa  and there is no kids club to speak of other than an area with a play station in it that kids can use.\n\nOur hearts were touched by the staff and Management of Pandawas Villas.",

Their attention to detail reflects in every nook and cranny of the place: the spacious and beautiful bathroom, comfortable bed, creative and relaxing lounge furniture... Swimming in the big eco pool was definitely one of the high lights. There was no smell of chemical and being surrounded by nature. It feels like I was swimming in a lake. The villa is located in a peaceful hill overlooking beautiful ravines, away from the hustle and bustle in the touristy area. However, the villa provides shuttle bus to many points in Ubud, so I could still explore in Ubud and come back to the villa for some R & R.  The staff was very friendly, professional, and helpful. The villa provides tranquility and total relaxation. I would definitely come back here again and again.",

              "text": "We selected Pandawas Villas solely on The Trip Advisor write up and recommendations.  This was our first trip to Bali and we had no desire to spend time on the beach preferring a central location to facilitate touring the island.  Ubud turned out to be ideal and the choice of the Pandawas Villas was extraordinary!  The Villas only have four large suites, situated around a large infinity swimming pool, which are virtually identical differing only in color scheme and view.  We had no idea what to expect in terms of service but our standards are high; in Asia we favor the Oberoi or Mandarin hotels.  The small staff of about six rotating on the front desk were as accommodating as the best of our prior experience.  They ensured our every request was fulfilled to the max and remembered all of our standing requirements.  Their breakfasts were fresh and as complete as we wished offering both Western and Balinese cuisine.  They even offered a dinner menu that could be supplemented with special requests although after the first night we preferred to sample some of Ubud's excellent restaurants.  (A friend who has a home in the area gave us a list of recommended spots for different food preferences all of which appeared accurate.)  Although the Villas are located about 10 minutes from downtown Ubud, they offer a free round trip shuttle at several times each day and are amenable to adapt to other times for a reasonable fee.  In a nutshell, Pandawas Villas offers luxury class accommodations and service at very reasonable prices.  I give it my highest rating for quality, service, and price!",

              "text": "My husband, myself and our 2 year old daughter were absolutely blown away from the moment we arrived at Pandawas.   We stayed for a luxurious 6 nights.  We could not help relax when we were made to feel so welcome and cared for by both the staff and the owners of the property.  The food was very good and although sometimes lunch was slow to arrive if you were easy going you would appreciate it as simply because they were always getting fresh ingredients each day.  They accommodated my daughters eating schedule and she simply loved the pasta and the rice porridge.  The whole property is very up to date for technology....rooms have surround sound, cable, wifi and of course they have a great room for kids to play in with a big screen tv for their favourite shows.\n\nWe enjoyed swimming in the 25 meter pool everyday and enjoyed taking walks/runs along the road that takes you through lovely villages and rice fields.  Everywhere people were so friendly.\n\nThe room was very impressive.  Large, clean and modern.  The beds were comfortable, the room was nice and cool and the bathroom was very BALI!  Even the shampoo, conditioner and body gel was great quality.  Pandawas has quality touches everywhere.\n\nWe enjoyed getting massages and pedicures poolside.  Walking the grounds was lovely and eating in different areas (rice field view, fish pond view, grand table) during our stay was a nice point of difference.\n\nPandawas met our every expectation and we would go again without hesitation.  If you like laid back vacations away from it all and to feel like you have a place all to yourself....then this is for you.",

              "text": "We recently stayed for a week in Villa Nakula and loved our little corner of the jungle. The owners met us warmly and assured me that anything our 2.5 year old son needed or wanted would be made available. That was a relaxing gesture! The staff here were very friendly and professional, we had great conversations and they obviously cared for our little boy. \n\nThe complex of Villas is so large and the infinity edge pool is seriously something you'd see in a resort of 50 rooms...here, you are sharing with just a few other people. We had families and honeymooners stay in the other villas during our time. You never felt like you were in anyone's space. The communal area is massive and then you also have a large fish pond, patio area and kids' games room to enjoy. We felt at home the whole time and not a single concern over security. The location ensures you have quiet evenings and we never felt disturbed by any noise in the other villas. Yes, you are situated like a duplex in two pairs but the rooms are huge, the walls are thick and there's enough space for everyone to relax. \n\nThe design of our villa was quite stunning and the TV area inviting - surround sound Marantz amp also makes things better :) The mosquito net for our son's bed was a perfect touch and we all slept soundly. I did notice that heavy rain made the bathroom area a little tricky at times but you just tread carefully! It's still a stunning outdoor bathroom nonetheless. The outdoor bales and hammock were great but it's becoming obvious that a lot of the wooden decking needs maintenance. But we would consider the maintenance program a tricky thing when you have paying guests and unseasonable rain. \n\nAlthough there was a decent menu to choose from it was hard to say ahead of time what we would feel like eating. And the prices aren't that cheap, drinks included. Although Wayan's Long Island Ice Tea was worth it ;)) Laundry is expensive and I would definitely suggest that there shouldn't be a charge for trips into town outside of the shuttle hours. For the number of guests and the number of staff available (and the cost of staying here) any ride into town should be complementary. That's what we've found staying at similar places in the area. We were given rides into town which turned out to be free of charge and we're grateful for this. With a small child and our preference for eating in central Ubud this made life easier. The wifi was pretty much non-existent which also made trips into town more appealing. \n\nThank you Annie for your help with checkout the night before our early flight. The bread baskets and water bottles you put together for 5am was so much appreciated. Nice touch! Breakfast here in the villas is more than adequate and, again, our son was given whatever his little tummy desired. This is a place for parents to relax! And we felt welcome with the owners and their family but they were only around for the first day or so. It never felt like we were intruding on their family compound or them being out of place on our holiday. This is a space for everyone to enjoy without any hang ups or bad attitudes. The smiling staff, the gorgeous amenities and that stunning jungle view ensure you feel well-looked after in your little slice of heaven.",

The owner obviously looks after her family first as you should but not when you have paying guests. Either use the property as your private residence as was stated or as a commercial property as it was sold.\nThe service from the local staff was the best they could provide considering the poor direction given by the owner. \nThe linen was filthy and very worn, the outside bathroom although a nice idea was very impractical and dangerous when it rained, with many sharp edges. I saw none of the \"Eco\" lodge as the rooms had no cross flow ventilation and therefore required the use of air conditioner. \nMeals other than breakfast were very expensive as were drinks.\nThe rooms themselves are just big hotel rooms certainly not villas, with a minimum amount of privacy especially when the owner and her extensive extended family roam and occupy all seating in the common area.\nI have never before found accommodation that I would not return to until now. The owner needs to give her staff the tools to express themselves and develop Pandawas Villas.",

The common areas are open to all as in any resort.  You however gave clear indication to the team that you find it inappropriate for your family to associate with people from a certain country. \r\n\r\nLinen:  We use batik linen freshly sealed and laundered from the \"laundrette\" - which you expressed dislike towards. Batik is an inherent part of Balinese culture and is always printed in matted shades. It does not make the linen worn out in any way. \r\n\r\nWe endevour to learn from feedbacks left by all our guests. Last 20 reviews our guests have done back with a happy smile. \r\n\r\nwith kindest regards\r\nPandawas Villas",

              "text": "Right from the get go, the service was exceptional. Wayan picked us up from the airport and drove us back to the Villas (It takes about 1 hr 15mins). He was very friendly and drove carefully.\n\nThe place is amazing. There are only 4 villas in total on a large amount of land which makes it feel very private. We stayed in Sahadewa. The room was HUGE!  It is decorated and furnished very well. \n\nThe food was delicious. As the place does not have a lot of guests at any one time, they buy and cook everything fresh. Just give the staff a little notice so they can get everything prepared. You also get the option of choosing where you would like to sit and eat. So many lovely places to choose from!\n\nMost of our time was spent lazing by the large pool. It overlooks some lovely scenery. We also went on a half day tour with Wayan (A different one - very common name in Bali). He was also very nice and took us to lots of nice places to see.\n\nI would highly recommend Pandawas Villas if you want to get away from the touristy areas. It is very quiet and relaxing and the staff were absolutely lovely. We really enjoyed our stay!",

              "text": "Pandawas villa strives to be true to its mythohistorical characters it is based on and does a great job of it. The villas are set to transport you to the historic ages with its beautifully decorated rooms and awesome landscaping. We stayed in the Nakula room with great views of the valley. The rooms are enormous. Had breakfast by the Koi pond is very relaxing. Its an ideal place for families with small kids. Lots of place for them to run around in the grounds and they also have a playroom by the entrance. Appreciate the attention provided by the owners who visited the villas during our stay. Our kid was running a bit of temperature on arrival and the owners had the driver get some over the counter medicines in no time. Fortunately his fever came down for us to enjoy the rest of the trip. Loved the massage by the pool. The turn around time on the snacks could be improved, especially  for those rainy evenings to chill out in the rooms. \nWould recommend this place for people who like to go off the track and enjoy a period of tranquil and peace in a very relaxed setting. Very friendly staff make the stay a memorable one.",

              "text": "Pandawa villas is an exclusive and quiet haven, far from the madding crowd. Beautifully designed,  with large rooms and a cosy atmosphere, it is an ideal place to relax in. Monica has done a lovely job and her staff are very attentive and helpful.  One can spend all day long lounging by the pool. One reaches the villa after passing through a lively market with good shopping options which are different from what one sees in the main Ubud market place; one also negotiates a breathtaking hairpin bend just before reaching the villa. The grounds are very well maintained and lovely for an early morning walk. Would recommend free pick up/drop to the main market place as there is no other way of getting there.  These could be at pre-scheduled times. Would recommend Pandawa to those looking for a relaxing break!",

The villas are so spacious and have everything you could possibly need, the outdoor bathrooms were amazing, the beds comfortable \u2013 all in all absolute luxury and you could tell that every detail about the resort had been thoroughly thought through.  The grounds, pool and ponds are stunning, we really enjoyed wandering around the gardens and the whole place is so peaceful and tranquil.  The best part of all though was the staff, I can\u2019t say enough about them, everyone was so helpful, friendly and attentive, nothing was too much trouble but at the same time they allowed you your privacy and space, it was so easy to relax.  We all felt so sad to leave and can\u2019t wait to return again, I would highly recommend Pandawas villas for a luxurious, relaxing break.",

The overall small scale of the villa complex creates a remote, exclusive feel but the rooms are enormous and decorated with a sophisticated modern balinese touch, creating a very indulge-yourself atmosphere.The pool and lobby area are stunning, and the perfect backdrop for the delicious morning breakfast. I loved that the location was along a wholesale shopping street... I had MANY great shopping finds. I recommend Pandawas wholeheartedly!",

              "text": "I went to Ubud for the first time in May, 2013 and stayed at Pandawas Villas.  What a gem!!  The sleek contemporary design with Balinese touch combined with beautiful, modern and trendy furniture was such joy to look at and enjoy during the stay.  The shower room is spacious and just gorgeous.  Even taking a shower has a luxurious feel.  The breakfast by the KOI pond was relaxing and peaceful.  The view from the villas was stunning.  The vast open space lobby with pretty lightening makes the lobby a very romantic and leisurely place to hang out.  The media room with big screen TV and stylish furniture looks welcoming for any families.  Everything about it made my trip to Ubud pleasant and memorable.  The location of the villas is a bit outside of the central Ubud, but it's an easy and quick drive.  The villas are very close (2 minute drive) to the main street with stores after stores of whole sale items such as home goods and interior decor.  The prices are unreal.  Best shopping experience was available only a few minutes away from the villas, which many regular tourists don't even know about but we did thanks to staying at Pandawas Villas!",

The setting is truly beautiful the gardens are relaxing and you feel immediately at peace. The breakfast was fresh and satisfying, good quality.\nI would definitely recommend this villa.",

The staff were friendly and helpful. the breakfast is delicious. If there was any cons it would be the price charged to go to Ubud centre, we paid 70.000 Rp which is quite pricey especially when we can get a driver to take us back for 40,000. Other than that it was great, would recommend to families and couples.",

From the moment you enter the beautiful, naturally landscaped property, the mind & body go into 'relaxation mode'! There are only four, very large, aesthetically designed luxury villas, each with its own theme- from the design of the furniture to the colours of the linen & walls, to the scents of the toiletries and aroma fresheners. I loved the open-air bathrooms, created in true Balinese style! Swimming in the infinity pool under blue skies, or under the stars; watching the setting sun from the 'Buddies bar'; a relaxing 4-hand massage by the pool; or just walking around aimlessly; it's all here! Being a 'foodie', I was amazed at the variety and flavours that we were presented with at every meal. The croissants were just 'yum'! The cooks catered to even vegetarian needs and came up with exotic fare. The ever-smiling staff were there when you needed them and yet not in your hair, which was lovely! Thank you Pandawas for a memorable holiday and we'd love to visit again.",

All I did was swim, chill out, eat, sleep... and not to forget... get some massages. This time it was different. I was told about the 4-hand massage where two masseuses would perform a synchronised massage. Got that a few times... have to say I've never experienced anything like that before. I haven't heard of it anywhere else. Thank you, I enjoyed it a lot.\n\nAnother thing which I can't thank you enough for is food. Due to my strict vegetarian diet (mostly vegan), it is very difficult for me to find a decent meal... even if food is available, not being able to communicate in the local language makes it difficult sometimes. Unfortunately, many places I go to do not understand the difference between serving vegetables and serving vegetarian food. You understand my dietary requirements and cater to that. Thank you for that.\n\nThe staff is very polite and helpful.\n\nI've upload some Pandawas pics I clicked with my iPhone and iPad. Would suggest this place to anyone who prefers to live in a place so quiet and peaceful surrounded by pure nature. I'll let the photos do the talking.",

A great place for families... our room was spacious, the kids had a lot of space to play around the property aside from the entertainment room and of course they loved the pool. The staff were very attentive and good with the kids. All in all, a wonderful stay, and we look forward to going back.",

              "text": "My weekend at Pandawas Villas is an experience I will always remember fondly.  The property is situated around 1 to 1.5 hours drive from the airport, and as you turn off the busy road to Ubud towards Pandawas, you are suddenly transported into a quiet, serene and lush green forest.  The Villa itself is breathtakingly beautiful.  The rooms are very tastefully decorated to reflect the local Balinese Hindu style, and equipped with all the mod cons that make a holiday comfortable.  The bathrooms are stunning, the most striking feature of which is a huge shower area - under banana leaves and coconut palm fronds - yes - under the blue sky!  The outdoor deck, the dining area and swimming pool are also beautiful.  The pool has a children's play area and is very child friendly.  They have a nice secluded bar area - the \"Buddies Bar\" which gives a birds eye view of the resort and the surrounding area.  And the best part is the massage area by the pool which overlooks a lush green valley, where you can be pampered by their signature \"4 Hands\" massage - yes, that's 2 masseuses!  The food is freshly cooked to order, wholesome and delicious.  A special mention about the staff who are friendly, courteous, give you your privacy but are available when you need them.  They are happy to cater to every reasonable request.  Overall a fantastic experience.  Well done Pandawas - like the Terminator, I'll be baaack!",

The coconut grooves, the half olympic size pool, spacious gardens and rooms are so beautiful. \nAs you enter Pandawas,  you will be over powered by the stretch of the green garden and the stunning Koi pond - I can just sit there for hours and read in peace. Sip my cup of tea and enjoy the feeling of peace and tranquility.\nThe staff are very friendly and the food is finger licking good. \nBuddy's Bar - a couple of drinks there in the evening and then to the Arjuna Bar for more drinks. I enjoyed my stay - and am already planning a vacation with my family again.\"",

Kids loved the entertainment room which had plenty of things to do for them. Staff is extremely fond of kids and we had time to ourselves when our kids were taken care of in the entertainment area. Food is amazingly fresh and tasty. Everything is cooked to order and there are no time restriction for any meals including breakfast. We would typically have breakfast past 11 am in totally relaxed setting by the koi pond. The place is close to Ubud market with just a five minute drive into the city and yet it is totally secluded with a very calm and serene and peaceful setting. We would definitely come back again and loved our stay here.",

We are frequent travelers and take three to four frequent breaks for a week each every year. We have experienced the worst and the best across Europe, USA and south east Asia. Pandawas Villas easily ranks among the very best for the total experience including location, ambience, service, hospitality and food. We plan to come back here whenever we need to de-stress. I am a vegetarian and was amazed at the range and quality of Indonesian vegetarian cuisine. I will be recommending the Pandawas Villas to all my quality conscious friends.",

They initally said there was no free service, then when I said I had seen it on a website the receptionist called the manager and they came back and whispered so the other guests wouldn't hear, that they have a free service once a day. Bit of a weird start. Their car service into town is twice what a normal taxi service is. We then tried to order to room service, as an after thought asked how long the spring rolls would take and was told 2 hours! When we were leaving we enquried about the free airport drop off service they mention on their website, they went a bit weird and said they would have to check with the general manager (who was eating his lunch a metre away and could hear everything). I went back to the room, as instructed, to wait for his call. when he had finished his lunch, he called the room and informed me that because we booked through booking.com and not their website we did not qualify as we got the room for cheaper, I said its the same as quoted on your website....still didn't qualify. In the end he (rather rudely) interupted me and offered it at a reduced rate. The service from receptionists and drivers etc. was lovely, very nice people but it is a shame the general manager is not as charming. We aren't tight but it just felt like you were constantly being ripped off at this place but perhaps most of the clientele are wealthy enough not to mind. Wish we had stayed somewhere more modest and closer to town.",

Website clearly mentions packets - for a basic packet airport pick and drop is not included. \r\n\r\nAfter checking in when you saw the services other guests were availing; you demanded (rather aggressively) the same to the staff even though you were explained that yours was a basic packet. Despite your having selected the most basic packet, we tried our best to accommodate your requests and offered you discounted prices where ever possible but you wanted everything for free. \r\n\r\nAs much as we would like to offer everything for free, we need to run the establishment in a fair manner. There are other guests who have paid for extra services and upgrades / special packets - it would not be fair on our part to charge them and offer you everything for free just because you display rude and aggressive behavior towards the staff who are trying their best to serve you and bring a smile back to your face. \r\n\r\nWe clearly mention to each guest that meals are sourced and cooked fresh and hence we request orders to be placed a meal in advance if possible - we do not store anything in freezers. You did not order any spring roll - so there is no question of it being delivered to you after 2 hours. \r\n\r\nThe team went out of their way to make your stay memorable. They too were taken aback by your unjustified demand on discounts and free services. \r\n\r\nWe still hope you have taken back good memories from Pandawas and the Island of Bali. \r\n\r\nkindest regards\r\nPandawas Management",

Pandawas Villas is set in lush and beautiful scenery - it felt like magic arriving here late at night; the stone lions guarding the entrance to the resort proper, the friendly staff offering ginger tea, the dimly lit pool and surrounding villas. We called ahead to order a late dinner from the complimentary airport pickup and was treated to a very good meal served by very very friendly and proffessional staff. When taking to the pool early morning the day after we were almost awestruck by the exotic scenery. Pandawas offers plenty; tranquility, beauty, luxury, greenery, friendliness. Service is great, meals are good. We are a family of four with two children of 6 and 3 and we all enjoyed just staying here, taking in the lifestyle and being treated by the super friendly staff. When not in the pool our daughters were playing in the dayroom, sometimes together with some of the staff allowing me and my wife to relax and being pampered by massage overlooking the jungle outside the Pandawas. Truly recommended! Since there are only four villas this makes a great multi-family retreat - that's what we are planning next spring!",

Immediately we were welcomed with so much warmth by all the staff.We were taken to our villa and felt so pampered and protected. All our requirements were already taken care of.  They seemed to understand our needs without even being told.The  warm welcoming smiles on every member attending us just washed away our tiredness..\nIn the morning we felt so very fresh and peaceful after a good nights rest . It was in the morning that we gradually noticed the perfection of the spacious rooms and understood the historical background of the decor of the room. We really loved the way the whole place revolved around the five  Pandawa brothers.\n\nThis resort gave us ,the rest and peace we needed at this age. The tranquility along with the luxurious amenities was what we older people needed. The food was absolutely wonderful , very suitable for our palate.\n\nWe enjoyed our walks within the boundaries of the resort. We got an opportunity to experience the wonderful green and clean nature and those amazing sounds of the night. Last but not the least the resort provided us with conveyance we needed to go out whenever we felt like.\nOH what a wonderful ,peaceful holiday it was. (this is my second trip to Pandawas)",

It was a great way to relax amidst lush green surroundings, totally luxurious and tastefully designed property - away from the crowds yet close enough to Ubud main areas. I was picked up from the airport with no hassles. The road to the property which winds through tall trees and steep inclines - and over a quaint bridge - sets the tone as you approach the villas. The resort has lots of stylish design touches (open architecture, wall hangings and paintings inspired by Indonesian art such as \"wayang kulit\" - the leather puppets etc.)\n\nRooms are truly large - more like a big villa. The large swimming pool nestles in the trees and almost borders the forest. The staff was unobtrusive yet courteous. They organized local tours in their van and the driver was friendly and knowledgeable. \n\nLots of nooks in the property to read a book or just take a nap. The entertainment room is well stocked with games, a PS3, DVDs etc - I did not need to use it much, though!\nHad the breakfast in their lookout over the rice fields - you can choose where you will eat breakfast / lunch etc - the staff will set it up as you are reaching there and breakfast will be served there. Would definitely suggest the rice-field-look out area - great experience as you can see the surrounding areas and people working rice fields in the distance.\n\nOn one of the days, walked back from Ubud main market to the villas - a fair bit of walking distance but got to experience a more \"local\" side of Ubud in that walk.\n\nIn general, I found my stay greatly relaxing and unwinding - stylish and luxurious. Would recommend very highly.",

We loved the peace, quiet, beautiful and elegantly done up property. Despite of a misunderstanding over a very small issue with the villa manager, we thoroughly appreciated the superbly helpful and polite of the staff during our stay.\nWill definitely come back!",

              "text": "Sadly, we were disappointed.  We spent a lot of time on the grounds and relied a lot on the service.  While everyone was VERY friendly, they were simply not trained/managed to come even close to the service level you expect for this price.  Not one meal was served as it should be - set of cutlery would be missing, or salt, or water, coffee would arrive 10 min after we finished breakfast or egg order was mixed up.  While these things happen everywhere sometimes, the consistency was rather tiring at the end.  One day kids were given two plates of food with nothing else - and kids choking on their food with ketchup fingers have difficulty waiting for several min to get a glass of water and some tissues.  When I asked for a comb, the lovely and helpful lady at reception .....dived into her own handbag...  so where do you start in this case? \nThe manager was absent and distant, acting rather like a part of the sleek decor than caring about his guests.  He tried charging us a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc that was orange in colour and tasted like port.  He insisted this was some sort of special type of white wine (orange!), and regardless of what has the truth - you either warn your customers upfront that your white wine is \"special\" and orange, or just manage their expectations without making them feel like idiots.  This discussion left an nasty after-taste.\nWhen we tried to watch a DVD, the system crashed 7 times. We abandoned. On a departure day printer was broken and they could not print the bill.  We asked to send it to us later by mail, as we had to share some of the costs with another villa... Over two weeks, and we are still waiting.  I doubt they will bother... Sad.\nIf I was reviewing for design magazine - yes, 5 stars.  But if you are truly staying on the grounds, prepare to be patient.....",

We value each and every guest\u2019s feedback and comments and truly appreciate the opportunity to improve our services and the quality of the guest\u2019s stay at the Pandawas Villas.\r\n \r\nFurther to your comments, we would like to once again apologize for the delay in the restaurant service that you had to face and the faux pas regarding the comb that you had to experience during your stay with us. We endeavor to keep all guests happy and continuously strive to improve both the quality of our staff and services to all guests.\r\n \r\nThe manager met you both personally during your stay with us on numerous occasions and was happy to assist whenever asked. The Sauvignon Blanc that you initially ordered was indeed a bit off color and we are happy you were satisfied with the second bottle of wine. We did happily take the charges of the initial bottle of wine from your bill too at the time of check out, so we are sorry to read that you still felt upset. But do please note many a time a bottle can become off -color and it is not something which is always under our control. \r\n \r\nThough we  all did our best to ensure that your stay with us was an enjoyable and a memorable one, I am once again sorry that you felt us lacking in quality. \r\n \r\nWe appreciate your taking the time and leaving us a feedback. However it is very confusing to note your strong negative comments which are quite  contrary to the mood of the positive feedback that you had left us with at check out and in our personal conversations during your stay with us.  We wish you had given us the slightest indication of how you felt during the time of your stay. \r\n \r\nThe bills that you had to settle manually due to both our printers coincidentally breaking down at the same time during your check out have already been emailed to your personal email id. Please check. They might have gone into your spam settings by mistake. \r\n \r\nOnce again, on behalf of the management and the entire team of the Pandawas Villas, we extend you our sincere apologies and assure you of our very best during your next stay with us.\r\n\r\nkindest regards\r\nPandawas Team",

The property is elegantly done up, the staff is superbly helpful and polite, we got excellent 4 hand massages done, surrounded by green translucent forests! Our rooms were fabulous... (I want rooms like these every where I go!) and the mix of luxury and simplicity was lovely. We went to Ubud every day, swam in the pool and ended up eating quite a few of our meals at the resort. Even when something wasnt on the menu, the staff put it together! Our personal breakfasts were served anywhere we wanted - even on topof the machan-like view site! The resort was our refuge - and although we had orginially intended to spend much time going around Ubud and Bali, it was so superb that we ended up just enjoying the luxurious surroundings and warm attendance at the resort!\n-A very happy traveller!",

Great location amidst the rice fields at about a 10 min drive from down-town Ubud. It's a small resort, consisting of 4 large villa's with a large pool to be shared. Notwithstanding its boutique style, the resort is very child-friendly, which offers some challenges if you enjoy reading a book or taking a nap poolside. We can highly recommend staying her for a long weekend of short week - the menus are great but somewhat limited. They only use fresh ingredients and offer you a tailor made meal (within the limits of the menus).",

                     "text": "Dear Guest,\r\n \r\nThank you for the feedback. We aim to work on the addressable points you have highlighted for us. \r\n \r\nAt the same time we would like to also take this opportunity to explain some of the misleading issues you have pointed out:\r\n \r\n1.   You booked a basic room package through online booking engine hotels.com without any additional complimentary items. We already shared and explained to you that there are no additionals to the packet you have requested much before your arrival. You only wanted to pay for one extra bed and also did not want to pay for breakfast for your 2 children. You requested us for price details on each item before making the booking and also on details for \" all paid extra services\". \r\n \r\nPlease understand as much as we would like to offer you \"free / complimentary services\" - we run a business and hence offer options for the guests to select from. \r\n \r\n2.   You were aggressive and condescending in your tone and mannerisms to our staff. While you were staying with us, we had expressed concern about your behavior to hotels.com.  Despite all - we still did our best to accommodate your requests to the best of our capabilities. \r\n \r\n3.   Rooms - from the very beginning as on our website as well - we have shared that being an eco-resort we only have 4 luxury villa rooms spread over 7000sq.m. We are 5 min by car from Ubud center [precisely 3.9km from the Arjuna statue in Ubud]. The fact that we\u2019re only 4 large suite rooms on a 0.7 hectare property which is secluded and yet 5 minutes away from Ubud is something that most of our guests appreciate. This allows them seclusion, privacy and yet proximity to Ubud. There is a shuttle service in morning/evening for drop/pick-up.\r\n \r\nWe have an eco-pool half an Olympic size, which is shared, by the 4 luxury villa rooms. Do note that most big resorts in Bali or otherwise have similar or smaller pools shared by much more number of rooms. You were aware of all these points before you booked. We even sent you the brochure with photographs before you confirmed the booking. Hence it was very shocking for our staff to be subjected to your constant complaints.\r\n \r\nDay 1  - you requested for a baseball ground for your kids - we have never claimed to have a baseball field in our premises. \r\n \r\nDay 2 - you complained that we do not have a soccer field where your kids can play a match - again we have not claimed to have any soccer field in our premises.\r\n \r\nBike rentals - as explained to you before your arrival, we provide this service as a package tour. You wanted it for free.\r\n \r\nMountain biking - you have to pay for the tour for your family. This is a full day tour. You wanted it for free. The tour is run by professionals and includes meals, sightseeing and a medic on stand-by.\r\n \r\nWe have never claimed on our website or on any other site that we have biking/hiking trails in the premises. We offer these tours as a service. \r\n \r\nAgain for scooter/motor rentals - you have to pay for the service. It was not included in your packet. \r\n \r\nRestaurants \u2013 Please note that everything cooked is freshly prepared. Given that we\u2019re a boutique resort with 4 villas, we do not freeze or store anything. We aim to provide fresh food which most of our guests have specially recommended highly in their reviews. However there are no free items. \r\n \r\nDay 3 - After we offered you some complimentary services - you sent a thank you note to the management appreciating that we were going out of our way to assist you and family. \r\n \r\nBest Regards,\r\n \r\nPandawas Management",

              "text": "We were at that hotel for 5 days/nights in July 2011, me, my wife and our 2 daugthers (9 and 10). We chose that hotel as it is away from the crowded Ubud city and wanted to rest.\nThe hotel is in a very nice landscape, not too far from Ubud but far enough to not be in the urban jungle Ubud has become with traffic jams, polution and harassement of tourists (visibly not by balinese people, but by street vendors coming from other islands).\n\nThis tiny hotel is very well designed, has just 6 large rooms (called villas as each room has a very high balinese roof) with the bathroom being outdoor (but with protection walls). One remark here is that our outdoor bathroom was adjacent to the reception and one of the breakfast areas, you always feel a bit uncomfortable, hoping there is nobody nearby having his tea or watching the landscape...\n\nThe stay could have been like on the web site brochure, but there has been a number of issues that other travellers may also encounter and that are worth being noted:\n- The reception phone rings loudly and is perfectly heard from the nearby rooms, day and night, as walls are made of glass and not soundproof at all. It systematically woke us either around 11PM (when about to sleep) or at 7AM (early wake up call)\n- Noisy children from another villa running on the wood deck and playing early in the morning and waking us up (again,most walls are glass and noise goes directly inside the room)\n- Same children playing at 7AM with the bamboo piano near the reception, for 1 hour, nobody stopping them.\n- During the day permanent loud chainsaw noise from forests and fields around the hotel, except Sunday (then a recommended day to stay there).\n- many cocks singing early in the morning, fun at the beginning, much less after a few days\n\nOne night was especially very bad with the phone ringing during the night and not being picked up, then in the morning children from a villa playing the bamboo piano near the reception for one hour from 7 to 9AM. That's one of the worst night I even spent in the past months, I would have burnt that bamboo piano if I could...\n\nAn issue: there is virtually no amenities (ie: cotton) in the bathroom, and travelers choosing a luxury hotel/villa don't bring amenities with them.\nAlso we were 4 in the room (2 parents and 2 children) but everything was setup for 2 people (like just 2 water bottles in the bathroom). Also when you book a family room they just add 2 mattress onthe floor, without any mosquito net. I informed the management, I hope they will be able to fix that.\n\nBeware: on the booking page of the hotel they ask for 2 dates. On all hotel web sites, worldwide, the 2 dates that are requested are check-in and check-out dates. But that hotel booking page is different and considers and charges the night of the second date. We got trapped and booked/paid one more night than wished and refund was declined when we discovered the issue,on-site. We had booked the following nights at the Westin Bali so ended up paying one night extra. BTW, Westin is fantastic but won't replace a few days in Ubud. At least we rested very well there...\n\nThose problems aside, the staff was always very good in helping us and advising visits, we really appreciated it.\n\nTo summarize: that hotel is very nice, in a nice environment but definitely not made for people to rest (I would not recommend it for a honeymoon unless the reception phone ring is muted, it is a Sunday with no chainsaw and you make sure there are no kids in the 5 other rooms). It can be a very good hotel for people not staying/sleeping long.\n\nAlthough they need to improve some things to justify their current prices and the \"Luxury\" tag they use, the staff is very helpful and kind and that's already a good start.",

                     "text": "Dear Guest,\r\nThank you for your review. We feel comforted by the fact that you were well taken care of by the staff and hence had a relaxing rested stay at Pandawas.\r\n\r\nI would like to positively respond to each and every point you have highlighted for us to work upon:\r\n\r\n1. Our location: we are in a very quite part of Ubud in the midst of coconut groves and paddy fields. Across the valley during your stay unfortunately there was construction going on - accounting for the noise -  We apologize again for this. We have already discussed this during your stay and have offered you compensation. \r\n\r\n2. Booking engine - we follow the same system as all other online agents - number of room nights you prefer to stay. The packet booked by you was a 3 nights stay packet. You booked 2 packets - for 6 nights stay - This means check in Day 1 and check out Day 7. Upon your booking in April we have communicated via email on all activities you wanted to do during your entire stay - day by day.  You have confirmed your happiness on emails to us for the complete proposal. \r\n\r\nDuring your stay - you realized that you had double booked a room night with another hotel and you wanted a refund. August being a peak season - we cannot offer any refunds at last minute on room nights booked.\r\n\r\n3. Excited children - Being a small boutique property there can be times during breakfast when kids are having too much fun. We did speak to the parents and removed the bamboo piano on your request. Once again we apologize. \r\n\r\n4. Open Bathrooms - As already explained to you - architecturally the property is designed in a typical Balinese style - taking care that all guests have complete privacy. \r\n\r\n5. Cocks singing in the morning - This is Ubud and we are surrounded by paddy fields. \r\n\r\n6. Extra beds - we use chiropractor king koil mattreses on a bamboo mat. We feel this is way much better than rollaway spring beds which are very uncomfortable to sleep on. \r\n\r\n7. Amenities - we fill in amenities daily. If a guest needs additional - as already shared - you simply need to request and the staff deliver it to your room.\r\n\r\n8. Children - We are a child friendly property (one of the reasons you booked with us since you were traveling with 2 children). We love kids and want families to enjoy their holiday. We cannot refuse families booking based on the request of one guest that there should be no other other kids in the other luxury villa rooms. I am sorry but this is against our basic principal. \r\n\r\nOnce again we would like to thank you for your booking. We hope to see you again at Pandawas. \r\n\r\nkindest regards\r\nPandawas Management",

              "text": "Well, what can I say that others haven't already said before me. \n\nPlanning a trip to Ubud for my sisters 50th Birthday, I wanted somewhere special and memorable.  A location where my sister could feel like a princess.  Well, I found it... from the first contact with Pandawas thru tripadvisor. I felt like I new them personally, I was treated with such warmth and helpfulness the words go beyond customer service. \n\nTrying to appease 9 people on a budget was the most difficult but they assured me nothing was impossible.  We arrived early afternoon and were greeted by all the staff, just like family welcoming us home.  They provided cool coconut drinks, freezing cold wash clothes and beautifully scented frangipani floral lays and that was just the welcome. \n\nBecause there were 9 of us we were able to reserve the entire property which was fantastic.  \n\nThe villas were amazing with each having their own special theme and meaning based on a the ancient Hindu saga \"The Mahabhrata which tells the epic tale of the five Pandawas brothers\" .  They are fully equipped with sound system, flatscreen tv, aircon, decor to die for and own personal bathroom amenities.. so indulgent!\n\nThe evening was arranged earlier with a special dinner for Jenny's 50th..the food was beautiful with something from all parts of the world and all tastes. Pandawas surprised us by presenting her with an amazing Black Forrest Birthday Cake, Bali style and the ultimate gift of a gorgeous little balinese dancing girl ILUH ...she was just amazing and the hi-lite of our evening, thankyou.\n\nThe pool and surrounds are everything the photos show and more and to rise early morning to the forrest awakening is truly memorable.\n\nThe 2nd day we were invited by the staff to join them in their temple to give offerings and prayer,  this is something we will cherish always.\n\nWe spent the following day at the Bali Zoo getting up close and personal to baby orangutans and other amazing wildlife...before coming home to our paradise Pandawas,  for a relaxing massage, another swim and fabulous dinner.\n\nI cannot recommend this property enough if your looking for that very special place to unwind and be treated like royalty. Like I said \"we asked for a hat and they presented us with a crown\"...and not just for Jenny but for all of us. \n\nCongratulations to Management and all staff.",

              "text": "We stayed at Pandawas for 4 nights and absolutely loved every minute of it. \n\nThe rooms were large and spacious and tastefully decorated. It shows when the proprietors have taken the trouble to appoint the rooms with tasteful local art and high quality bedding. There is nothing 'standard' about the villas - everything is unique and has been carefully thought out. Each villa has a distinct personality based on the Pandawa brothers, and it's reflects down to the littlest detail - such as the scents and colors used in each room. \n\nThe bathrooms - aaah! Copper bathing tubs - in a garden like setting. Bliss!\n\nWhat we loved the most was the absolute privacy we had while we were there. With only 4 villas, this is a perfect location for a private and exclusive holiday - no crowds or buffet service. The staff are there when you need them but more of the time we felt like we were on our own private estate. \n\nThe location is off from the main central town - about a 11 minute drive by car. The villas can arrange drop-offs to town and it's easy to take a cab back to the villas even if you stay out till late in Ubud town. \n\nOf  note is how perfect Pandawas is for children. The lounge has a children's playmat and a wide range of toys and even an extensive childrens' DVD collection. Our son loved the Koi pond and the staff were kind enough to give us fish food. I loved how personalised the service felt. \n\nMy husband and I arranged for individual massages. It was done in the privacy of one of the thatched tents besides the swimming pool but with a view of the forest and fields. Sure beats that annoying music they play at spas elsewhere.  I requested a pre-natal massage and they had no problem arranging for a masseuse who knew what to do. \n\nIf you have any doubt about staying here; don't hesitate even for a moment. It's a perfect getaway from the crowds. It's authentic yet luxurious -  a reminder of what good hospitality should look and feel like.",

              "text": "This was our first trip to Bali. It was a last minute decision to celebrate my 40th on a holiday instead of a party. We traveled with our 3 children aged 6yr, 3.5yr and 1.5yr. After 3 nights in Kuta, 4 nights in Semiyak we finished with 5 unforgettable nights (6 days) in Ubud, staying at Villa Pandawas. We were staying at Pandawas the first week of October 2010 in 2 Villas.\n\nVilla Pandawas is breathtakingly beautiful! \u2013 An exclusive resort for an unforgettable experience. Exquisite style set amongst secluded tropical forest and gardens.\n\nWe would highly recommend Pandawas to:\n\u2022 Honeymooners\n\u2022 Romantic stay\n\u2022 Celebrations or special occasions\n\u2022 Groups of friends (4 Villas in total)\n\u2022 Families and extended families - don't let the opulence fool you - the staff are very down to earth and adore children.\n\nThe 7 star treatment started the moment I made an enquiry with the Manager calling me personally to answer any questions I had as it was a very last minute booking. Correspondence was immediate and hassle free. Our complimentary transfers from our Villa in Semiyak and to the airport were on time without a hitch. The hospitality of their staff was exceptional and our children love them all dearly as they became good friends. Nothing was ever any trouble for the staff and our requests were always met with a genuine smile and dealt with immediately. We were sad having to say farewell but we hope to return someday.\n\n5-7 mins drive north of Central Ubud in Tegallalang (famous for terraced rice fields). It's secluded, yet well located to tourist attractions such as the Botanical Gardens, Elephant Safari Park, Egret roosting attraction and the terraced rice fields, along with central Ubud. \n\nPandawas is less than 12 months old (time of writing review). The place has been built in harmony with it's surroundings creating a sense of serenity. There are expansive gardens and meditation ponds to explore (kids loved this) along with a games room which contained TV and videos, video games, board games, chalk board, puzzle mat, books etc. The kids even ate their dinner in there one night  while \"Mum & Dad\" had an uninterrupted romantic meal together. Other child friendly items included; baby cot & High chair to Australian safety standards, inflatable pool toys, babysitting, child friendly menu. The swimming pool was also child friendly with 2 areas much shallower for young kids (perfect for my 3.5yr) and then some very wide steps which served my 1.5yr old perfectly as he loved to explore the pool with independence (naturally with me by his side). The pool was big enough to swim laps and looking over the horizon edge was lovely.\n\nMost nights we chose to eat at Pandawas as the food was so fresh (they would collect the fresh ingredients daily) and then we were able to relax on our front deck (children fast asleep) with cocktails in hand, listening to cicadas ringing, frogs croaking, geckos click-clacking, and some nights, the pattering of rain. This is when we were glad to be a little bit out of central Ubud!\n\nWe can't wait to return to this place of paradise!\n\nNoteworthy aspects:\n\u2022 Unique garden bathrooms with double vanity, bath, shower (with huge rainhead and handheld head), hairdryer, robes, slippers, sewing and shaving kits etc\n\u2022 Fabulous hot and cold water with good flow\n\u2022 Purest soft and fluffy white towels\n\u2022 Egyptian cotton bed linen\n\u2022 All powerpoints were multi-national (accepting all Country cords)\n\u2022 Robe area with makeup table with excellent lighting\n\u2022 Lots of wardrobe space for storage of suitcases and clothes\n\u2022 Combination safe \n\u2022 Excellent Villa lighting with extra switches mounted next to beds (all switches had tiny lights so you could locate them in the dark)\n\u2022 Surround sound stereo system hooked up to the large LCD TV in each villa with iPod dock & DVD player (included a Marantz Amplifier)\n\u2022 Free WiFi connection\n\u2022 Fresh organic food\n\u2022 First class friendly hospitality from staff\n\u2022 Massage hut looking out to tropical forest\n\u2022 Double hammock with tropical forest outlook\n\u2022 Air conditioned Villas and Games Room (containing some good DVDs and reading material for adults also)\n\u2022 Driver service for pickup/dropoffs or tours\n\u2022 Large infinity pool with some shallow areas for young ones\n\u2022 Tastefully decorated villas all with unique colour themes with the highest finishing standards",

The resort provided out-of-the world luxury, privacy and an environment to de-stress.\nProperty: the huge swimming pool with minimum chemicals, Bathtub/shower in open sky, huge rooms set an ideal ambiance. Just 5 cottages/Bungalows provided the privacy & the peaceful ambience I wanted\nStaff: Professional yet friendly. Took good care of my kids when ever my wife & I wanted to go out alone. The staff helped us with local sightseeing, cuisine, etc  not listed in most travel manual. \nLocation: Cant get better. On the hill-top, way from crowd yet 5 minute drive to the bustling UBUD.\nFood Was good you can get local food as well as Indian food, \nNot to miss: The massage. The best in South East Asia.\nEfficiency: Right from airport pick up to check-in/check-out to billing, the experience has been been 10/10.For the price they charge, this property is worth every cent",

The Main resting area, it was so perfectly done, so much comfort, warm and elegance of the ambience. We love the nice settings of the villas!! it overlooked at the river valley, beautiful tree, nice pools, its just so peaceful. The rooms are huge and beautifully done. The foods are great ! The staffs are excellent ! The villas are Luxury!  The view is breath taking. I have nothing to say other than it is beyond what we expected, i highly recommend this villas to anyone who like to stay in Ubud area....we would be definitely coming back !!",

              "text": "This resort is well located. If someone wants to visit cover all of Bali, it is easy to travel from here to the North, East, West and South of Bali. There is the Monkey forest and lotus temple close to this place, lot of wholesale shops/markets around which is great.\n\nThe resort itself is very personalised, very unlike a hotel where there can be many people. Here you can have the whole resort to yourself and your family as there are 4 villas and a very personalised service.\n\nThe villas are very spacious and the unique thing is each villa has its own theme of the Pandawa brothers, its own colours. My favourite place in this whole resort was the bathroom... yes, as this is no usual bathroom you will see. It is open air... and at the same time well covered with trees and leaves for privacy. The sky is the ceiling. The copper bath tub with shower is impressive.\n\nThe food, I have to say, was excellent. I am a strict vegetarian... more close to a vegan, and I have had this problem everywhere I have been. It is very difficult for me to find a place where they will make vegetarian and non-vegetarian food separately. At Pandawas, I spoke to the Chef and he was more than happy to cater unique balinese dishes which were completely vegetarian. I felt quite comfortable eating here. I stayed at the resort for 5 days and every time there were different balinese dishes. Breakfast, as with most Bali resorts, you have a selection of the best fruits and fruit juice.\n\nThe staff is so nice and polite but then whoever has been to Bali would know that. Balinese people are extremely polite and helpful and you would rarely find a cheat. I personally haven't and I've been to Bali twice now. Everyone from the kitchen staff to the driver we got to the people who are working in the gardens and other places in the resort are always smiling, ready to help and polite. My wife and I had been given a driver and for 4 days we covered each of the directions of the island. The driver was actually the bar man but he came along with us as he knew English better than others and we had requested for someone who could converse with us and show us around... and it was fun chatting with him. I am a photographer and every few minutes I wanted him to slow down so I could take a photograph without getting out of the car... I know people around me get impatient but he showed no signs of that. He was telling us about places and culture and we discussed many topics... all in all a brilliant experience.\n\nThe resort is surrounded by rice fields and forest... of course all the time you hear birds and other creatures. The resort has its own ponds, bar, outside bar, Theatre room, plasma/lcd tv with nice sound system in every villa, and other amenities.\n\nOn the other hand, it is a bit far from the airport and it can take you some time to get to the beach but if you want to cover the whole island; want to visit the wholesale markets; but particularly want to get away from commercial environments and noisy areas like Kuta beach, this is definitely the place to check out. After all I can go to night clubs and noisy areas in my own city. The whole idea is to get away from such places. The only night life here is beautiful stars and sounds of nature's creatures.",

Each villa and the restroom concept is unique, based on the ancient Hindu saga \"The Mahabharata\" which simply blew us away. That's not all, you get to use the specially handcrafted goods (stationary and toiletry) in accordance with the villa theme. We thoroughly enjoyed this beautiful and serene haven in Ubud, a perfect getaway nestled among nature. The lovely hosts made our stay truly memorable. The photos don't do justice, the splendor needs to be felt rather than seen! I would love to visit Ubud in Bali soon just to experience the serenity of these villas all over again.",

We are sorry to read that the bath did not work long - could have been a simple plumbing issue - we wish you had shared it with the staff. Our technician could have had a look at it. Its open air - and sometimes in the rain and wind leaves get stuck. \nWe do offer a selection of foods and drinks at the restaurant which is kept simple on order to serve just 4 villas. We only serve fresh food. \n\nWe look forward to meeting you again. \nThank you for visiting us. \nkind regards\nPandawas Villas Management Team",

Le lit mega confort.\n\nConcernant l'accueil, le d\u00e9but a \u00e9t\u00e9 parfait. Accueil chaleureux mais d\u00e8s que le manager c'est rendu compte que l'on restait que un jour le ton \u00e0 l\u00e9g\u00e8rement changer. Un peu moins volontaire. Et il n'a pas vrmt tenter de nous aider pour le petit d\u00e9jeuner. Nous partions tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t pour un trekking. Finalement c'est une des employ\u00e9es qui nous a fait faire un petit dej pr\u00e9parer le soir.\n\nDonc en r\u00e9sum\u00e9 h\u00f4tel excellent, la piscine est superbe. Bungalow vrmt bien (un peu plus d'intimit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre pour certains). Nourriture ms et restaurant parfait !",

              "text": "Die Pandawas Villas liegen am Rande von Ubud und doch nur 10 Minuten mit dem Roller zum Zentrum. Die 4 Villen liegen an einem gro\u00dfen Pool und sind Top-modern ausgestattet und sehr gro\u00df. Das offene Bad ist wundersch\u00f6n und in sehr gutem Zustand. Die Villen sehr sch\u00f6n eingerichtet, mit toller Musikanlage und einem \u00fcberdimensionalen Bett. Alles ist sehr sauber und die Anlage bzw. der Garten sehr gepflegt. Nat\u00fcrlich gibt es etwas instandhaltungsbedarf im Au\u00dfenbereich (Gel\u00e4nder, Liegen, etc.) aber wo ist das nicht in Bali so...\nDas Personal war super nett und sehr zuvorkommend. Es waren die vielen kleinen Aufmerksamkeiten, die den Service besonders machten (z.B. Abends die bereits zugezogenen Gardinen wenn man zur\u00fcckkehrte, oder die jederzeit nette Begr\u00fc\u00dfung und das Interesse an den G\u00e4sten). Wir haben uns hier sehr wohlgef\u00fchlt und k\u00f6nnen die Pandawas Villas absolut weiterempfehlen.\nPotenzial hat jedoch noch das Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck, denn da das Hotel kein eigenes Restaurant besitzt, gibt es quasi keine Auswahl (mit ausnahme der Zubereitung der Eier) und ist auf die Dauer doch sehr eint\u00f6nig. Hier sind kreative Ideen f\u00fcr den Preis gefragt!",

On s'y sent bien !\nDe plus, nous avions l'impression d'\u00eatre seuls, d'\u00eatre \"\u00e0 la maison\", nous ne croisions que tr\u00e8s rarement les autres h\u00f4tes de l'h\u00f4tel. Une sensation de qui\u00e9tude et de repos, loin du Ubud anim\u00e9 ! Un r\u00eave !\nLe personnel est au petit soin. Adorables! Ils se plient en 4 afin que vous passiez un s\u00e9jour parfait tout en \u00e9tant \"friendly\". Le PDJ tr\u00e8s correct est servi devant votre chambre, au bord de la piscine.\nL'h\u00f4tel \u00e9tant vraiment excentr\u00e9, une navette gratuite vous emm\u00e8ne ou vous voulez dans Ubud. Le top !\nNous n'avons pas mang\u00e9 de repas mais avons profit\u00e9 des massages balinais organis\u00e9s par l'h\u00f4tel dans un cadre splendide. Ceux-ci \u00e9taient tout de fois assez chers par rapport aux prix g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pratiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 Bali et nous avons trouv\u00e9 bien mieux ailleurs...\n\nNous vous conseillons fortement cet h\u00f4tel si vous recherchez le calme et que vous appr\u00e9ciez la nature. Tout \u00e9tait parfait !\n\nAutre conseil \u00e0 Ubud: participez \u00e0 un tour en v\u00e9lo dans les rizi\u00e8res et villages environnants. Notre meilleur souvenir d'Ubud !",

              "text": "L'h\u00f4tel est digne d'\u00eatre dans un magasine de d\u00e9coration, l'endroit est beau, perdu au milieu de la v\u00e9g\u00e9tation, rien n'est laiss\u00e9 au hasard, le mobilier et la d\u00e9coration sont tr\u00e8s bien choisis. Mais l'h\u00f4tel qui est d\u00e9j\u00e0 tr\u00e8s \u00e9loign\u00e9 d' ubud ou d'un quelconque centre d'int\u00e9r\u00eat, est tristement sans vie. Le personnel est transparent. Cet hotel est id\u00e9al pour faire une retraite, ou s'il l'on est venu \u00e0 bali pour la recherche du moi profond. Les 4 \"villas\" sont en fait deux chambres cot\u00e9s \u00e0 cotes de chaque part du hall de la r\u00e9ception. Malgr\u00e9 le calme sans vie de l'h\u00f4tel nous avons quand m\u00eame r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 sentir un manque d'intimit\u00e9 important. On n'osait a peine faire de bruit ou parler \u00e0 voix haute, pour ne pas d\u00e9ranger le calme ambiant ou les autres h\u00f4tes tr\u00e8s proches. Cet h\u00f4tel s'apparente en fait a une chambre d'h\u00f4tes, dont le prix est bien trop \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour le service que l'on a re\u00e7u. Exemple : petit d\u00e9jeuner tr\u00e8s bon mais strictement limit\u00e9, navette \u00e0 70 000 roupies sauf \u00e0 la prendre dans les 3 cr\u00e9neaux horaires, sachant que le dernier partait d' ubud a 19h donc impossible de remonter gratuitement a l'h\u00f4tel si l'on souhaite passer la soir\u00e9e \u00e0 ubud. Je pr\u00e9cise que nous sommes \u00e0 chaque fois remonte en taxi pour 50 000 roupies, l'h\u00f4tel profite donc de ses h\u00f4tes m\u00eame sur la navette !!!  On a pass\u00e9 une soir\u00e9e \u00e0 l'h\u00f4tel, le d\u00eener \u00e9tait une fois encore tr\u00e8s bon, mais incomplet, il manquait un plat et le dessert n'\u00e9tait pas celui de la carte. Les services n'\u00e9taient donc pas a la hauteur du prix pay\u00e9 pour notre s\u00e9jour de 3 nuits. C'est dommage, car avec un meilleur management et une meilleure politique commerciale, l'h\u00f4tel qui b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie d'un cadre privil\u00e9gi\u00e9 pourrait \u00eatre tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able. Nous avons \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9\u00e7us et ne le recommandons pas.",
