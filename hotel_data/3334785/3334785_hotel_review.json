It is very clean and modern we had the 3 room Villa on the Rooftop with our own private pool, Butler Service  and lounging area it was absolutely spectacular. \n\nThe booking came with Butler Service that attended to our breakfast needs in the morning and anything we needed throughout the day. We had fresh fruits, cereals and choices of breakfast dishes both traditional as well as North American type cuisine. \n\nWe spent a good portion of the morning swimming in the pool chatting or having a drink at poolside and after a long day, a dip at midnight was amazing. \n\nOur Butler Service was excellent they introduced us to the most valuable guide in Bali Ketut who I would highly recommend he speaks English fluently is knowledgeable about some of the tours and we use them throughout our stay he can be reached at tourbalinese@gmail.com I quite liked his service and would highly recommend him. Well done for the staff and ownership of 111 this most definitely is a place I would go back.",

This was our third trip to Bali and we were keen to just chill out and relax in Seminyak, an area we have come to enjoy. We had seen One Eleven on previous visits and were impressed with it\u2019s simple yet modern exterior. We were not disappointed!\nThe villa was fantastic - private, spacious and peaceful. The simple yet luxurious design surpassed our expectations. We found all rooms in our Villa very comfortable and appreciated the minimalist aesthetic. The pool, by the way, was exceptional and used extensively.\nWhat really made the stay truly memorable was the excellent One Eleven team. Everyone, without exception, was friendly, extremely helpful and obliging - a real credit to One Eleven.\nOur special thanks to Wijaya, Sinta, Mira, Kadek and Adi for helping make our stay so enjoyable. Special thanks also to the security team for their help and assistance when my phones were stolen by someone on a scooter when we were returning from dinner one evening. \nWe highly recommend One Eleven to anyone looking for quality accommodation in the heart of Seminyak - you won\u2019t be disappointed!

Our villa was much bigger than we were expecting, the pool is such a generous size and the open layout of the villa was really, really cool. Breakfast is chosen from a special menu the day before  and there are lots of options then it is cooked and prepared exactly when you would like it. We ventured out for little walks around Seminyak to shop and try some of the food around - don't miss Bo and Bun (really fresh and delicious Vietnamese) and we were very impressed by the stylish Japanese restaurant upstairs above the reception area at One Eleven. Definitely go there if you love Japanese. We had inroom tspa treatments and personal yoga lessons, everything seamlessly arranged for us - just go already!",

The breakfasts were excellent, and the w-fi worked well. It's cool that they have blue tooth speakers that allow you to play your music outside. The staff is also very friendly and helpful. One night we were going to meet friends in Canggu (around 30 minutes away by car). We asked the staff about how to get there. And we were so surprised when they offered to drop us off there for free! They had already been very generous with arranging free shuttles for us around Seminyak. But the ride to Canggu struck us as going above and beyond. I definitely recommend One Eleven to anyone looking for a beautiful and welcoming place to stay in Seminyak.",

              "text": "After staying at St Regis Bali, we decided to extend our trip in Bali for one more night. We looked online and wanted to have a villa experience this trip, so we finally decided on One Eleven and oh man....it was worth it. Best decision I made in 2018 so far.\n\nThe service was wonderful, they have sent a car to St Regis to pick us up and it only took about 40-50 mins from Nusa Dua to the hotel. Check in was quick and painless, and they showed us to the villa. \n\nAs soon as the butler opened the door, my gf and I were in awe. The property is amazing! I loved the design cues and the pool is HUGE for villa standards. We also loved the amenities, especially the slipper, it is quite stylish. The location of the villa is about 10-15 minutes walk to the shopping/food area but they do provide a shuttle car for your convenience. \n\nFor breakfast, they will come to your villa and cook the food for you right there, nothing beats that. We also partook in the in-villa massage and that was seriously just cherry on top. Absolutely loved it.\n\nWe will definitely be back.",

We were exhausted, didn't feel like shopping around the thousands of alternatives (or countless recommendations every Australian offers) so we just went ahead and booked it.\nGREAT decision. One Eleven offers an absolute haven of luxury and privacy. In all honesty, with in house massages and room service, we need not have left our villa for the entire stay. However, they offer a car service which is a fuss and stress free way to get yourself to lunch and dinner.\nOne night we even had a romantic in-villa dinner, the set menu was not overly inspiring but the setting of a little table by the pool with candles and rose petals was a agreat way to spend the last night of a romantic getaway that provided us with the relaxation and solitude we were looking for.",

We didn't know what to expect as we heard less than good things about Seminyak and the chaos there, but 111 is an excellent choice. From the large villa to the huge private pool - to the personalised yet efficient service - we can not fault this resort. We were so happy we ended up at One eleven and stayed in the villa more than normal I think. We love that it is a quiet, child free place and that it is smoke free (?) too. The bathroom was huge with very nice bathroom products, the bed was very comfortable and the breakfasts were wonderful and decadent. The food was really good and we ate a lot of lunches and dinners there too. The service was really good and the staff is very sweet and service minded. We really enjoyed both in house massages as well and tried to book a third one before we left, but the spa was full.  One tiny piece of feedback for change is that we believed the free shuttle also could pick us up after we were done eating at night if it wasn't too late, but that never happened and we never understood wh,y as there were cars and drivers available (we think,) and not much traffic either.  All in all we had a blast at villa 8 and will book 111 again if we go back to Bali.",

We were really happy to hear that the hustle and bustle of being located in the center of Seminyak did not encroach on your stay. We do like to think of One Eleven as a sanctuary in the center of Seminyak where you can step away from it all - and we are therefore delighted to hear that you spent more time in your villa than usual.\n\nIn regards to the shuttle service, we do indeed offer a complimentary pick up service if we have drivers available and do apologize if there was any miscommunication on our end in regards to this. We normally give our cards with the contact number on to arrange pick up but we will certainly be looking into this and make sure this is better communicated.\n\nIt was our pleasure to be of service to you and thank you very much for staying with us at One Eleven. \n\nWe hope to welcome you back in the near future.   \n\nBest regards,\nSahan Amer\n ",

The villa space and design was intended to distance each villa from their neighbor as much as possible to ensure privacy. Also being an adult only resort we normally find that our guests are respectful to neighboring villas and generally receptive to requests to reduce disturbance. We do however apologize that on this occasion this effected your stay but overall we are thrilled that you enjoyed your time with us.\n\nThanks again for choosing to stay at One Eleven and we look forward to welcoming you back soon.\n\nWith best regards,\nSahan Amer  ",

The staff were all super friendly, discreet, professional and ready to cater to all our needs. Having a chef and butler prepare breakfast in the villa was beyond indulgent, as were the spa treatments in our own private gazebo. The resort is in close proximity to Seminyak's main shopping strip, all within walking distance. Of course there are also a large variety of eateries in the area to satisfy all tastes. The resort has a shuttle service to the beaches and the drivers are helpful and informative. For an indulgent, relaxing break from the rat race, this is the place to escape to.",

Complimentary shuttle into Seminyak, turn down service, home-made luxury toiletries, privacy, breakfast cooked personally and privately in your villa each morning and airport transfers. Nothing is too much effort and no detail is overlooked. I have stayed at One Eleven twice and it is the best place I have stayed and this is mostly due to the staff who are unwavering in their quality of service and care. Although you aren't walking distance to the beach, the complimentary shuttle will lift you anytime of day and the villa is a calm and peaceful slice of heaven to return to once you are done with the hustle and bustle of Seminyak for the day. Thank you One Eleven. ",

Per previous commentators, the service, quality of villas & the peace & quiet (!) were fabulous.\nHighly recommend making use of the transport services, especially to local restaurants or shopping spots. We sampled in-villa dining (lunch) & in-villa massage services too. Both an added luxury to top off a memorable stay. Compliments to the staff & management of this wonderful property. \nHighly recommend.\nPS - if travelling with kids, check out BVillas - just around the corner & managed (?) by the same group.",

The staff are so helpful in making sure you have all you need , from extra supplies, to transport (free), to booking restaurants. \nYou're a short walk to eat street, but it's very quiet.\nFor a one bedroom villa, the pool is a pool, not a plunge pool.\nThe bathroom is enclosed, so you're not sweating as you hope out of the shower- so many other villas have open air bathrooms, that sound wonderful, until you use them.\nThe breakfasts are also great- not always the case at other villas.\nI'd be very happy to stay here again.",

              "text": "Where to start?! Everything about One Eleven was absolutely magical. We had the most incredible stay here. \n\nWhen we first arrived the charming security guard welcomed us and showed us in where we met by the wonderful lady behind reception who gave us a cold towel and delicious welcome drink. \n\nWe were driven about 20 metres in the buggy to our villa. As soon as the entrance door was opened, our jaws dropped. We were blown away by the sheer size of our own private villa. We weren't expecting a villa so big, a pool so big, a garden so big! \n\nOne Eleven is very modern and as a result everything is so clean. Everything was impeccable.\n\nThe bed was the most comfortable bed we've ever slept in. The bathroom was beautiful with fresh towels constantly. The complimentary toiletries that they give you are all lovely. \n\nThe service was outstanding. For breakfast, you have a private chef come to your villa to cook for you. You get a selection of fruits, bread, juice and tea anyway, but on top of that you can choose a dish from their daily menu. Between us we had eggs Benedict, French toast, an omelette and waffles. Everything was exceptional and such a treat to have it all made in front of you. \n\nWhat is nice about One Eleven is that their prices are really reasonable. Unlike other five star hotels who try to charge a fortune for food and spa treatments, everything at One Eleven, from massages to lunch, was better priced than a lot of places in town. Sadly we didn't get to try their Japenese restaurant, but if it's anything like their breakfast and lunch, I'm sure it's sensational! \n\nThe service is second to none. Everyone is incredibly welcoming, kind and sincere. They go above and beyond to make sure everything is perfect. The complimentary private car service is a great added luxury.  \n\nIt's a 5 minute walk from restaurants and shops, but it feels like you're completely secluded. We had the best time at One Eleven and we can't recommend it enough. Our stay was absolutely faultless and we can't thank the staff enough for everything they did for us. We will return one day for a much longer stay :)",

Whats's worse is that it was peak season and I couldn't find a reservation anywhere, (Apart from the cheap places) there was limited availability.\n\n................. time to break a sweat\n\nLucky for me, I found 1-11 listed on bookings.com website and as I was filling out the form I came across a section for special request, feeling streaky, I thought I'd try my luck and made a special request for a dozen red roses, a dozen white roses and petals on the bed sheet layer out to spell happy birthday Wendy for our arrival.\n\nUpon our arrival to 1-11, the first thought that came to mind was 'they must have used high res cameras to take those display photos'.\n(The place has its creaks and slight signs it's getting long in its tooth)\n\nA short buggy ride carted us down to our private villa with our own pool (just like the photos) separate massage room, an open dining area and our sleeping quarters where they had arranged the two dozen roses, one white the other red, and spelt out Happy Bday Wendy as per my request. (What a way to win brownie points, and the trips only just started)\n\nThe things that I love about 1-11 was the service, they will do just about anything that you ask, provide that it's reasonable.\n\nBreakfast is cooked at your villa by your own chef each morning, you can choose your menu the night before. The dry noodle was my favourite (migoreng).\n\nFree 1 hour massage in your own private villa, or you can take a shuttle down to 1-11 day spa and treat yourself to the menu. \n\nEach afternoon, there is fumigation for mossie which can smoke up the villa, although it's only for a short time it does get smokey. Better than catching malaria or worse, dengue!\n\nMy overall experience was very pleasant and I would definitely revisit one eleven again. \n\nValue wise, its right up there with the pricing however it's worth it for all them extra brownie points \n\nService is 9/10",

I almost had buyers remorse and cancelled in favour of one of resorts next to the beach but I am soooooo glad we didn't - it turns out to be the most amazing hotel/villa experience ever.\n\nThe communications leading up to our arrival were professional and well timed and this meant our airport pick up went very smoothly. When we arrived we were greeted with delicious juice and cold towels before being escorted to our villa. When Agus opened the main door we were absolutely blown away by how beautiful everything was - all lit up and with champagne waiting and chilled champagne flutes. The room/s are huge, open air and so elegant. Beautiful big bathroom and amazing cosmetics. \n\nWe took advantage of the shuttle service many times (truly wonderful service), also a spa experience in our own personal spa gazebo. We mixed our time up between swimming in our own very large pool, exploring Seminyak and sampling some of the beach clubs (Alila probably the nicest for a few hours). We spent more time in our room than we normally would on holiday because it was so beautiful and relaxing. We loved having breakfast cooked for us in our room - beautiful choices and fresh pressed juice each day. Very chic.\n\nThe biggest impression was the service of the team - so helpful, nothing was too much trouble and they were all so polished. Particular mention to Agus (went above and beyond), Gita and Wayan for driving us everywhere!\n\nThanks for making our trip so memorable and special. We will be back.",

From the personalised complimentary car service and random follow-up to my request for a pink flamingo (which I was NOT expecting them to be able to fulfil) - this place and the staff are incredible. \n\nWe wanted our breakfast to come in stages and they were kind enough to do that for us. The complimentary 6pm turn-down treats from Crepes to Sushi were just such a great touch. The toiletries were DIVINE.\n\nWhat's more with this place is that you are right in Central Seminkyak - so you can enjoy the retreat and also what it has to offer outside. Stay here - you wont regret it. \n\nThe only thing I would say is a couple of mornings I was unable to have my preferred coffee - as their Nespresso delivery hadn't come in and they didn't have any to offer me. It sounds like a first world problem - and it is. (I had decaff).",

              "text": "I'd been wanting to stay here for years, since a friend came back raving about how beautiful it was, and I finally got a chance to just a few days ago. It did not disappoint. \n\nThe villas are huge and beautiful - I'm personally not a fan of the traditional Balinese heavy wood and stone decor, so I found the clean, modern aesthetic of the villas and the resort as a whole, just amazing. The resort's a mere 5 minute walk from shops and restaurants, but once you're in your villa, you might as well be miles away - the peace and tranquility were a welcome respite from the noise and activity around Seminyak. The room, pool and massage pavilion were very clean and well maintained, and we really appreciated the small touches the resort offered, e.g. fresh milk and slices of lemon in the fridge each day, plenty of beach towels and even head cushions for the deckchairs, a wide (and I mean WIDE) range of toiletries (with different ranges for men and women), offers to make up the room each time we ordered something, and the free car service around Seminyak!\n\nHaving breakfast cooked for you daily in your own kitchen rocks! The in-house room service menu was also decent, very very well priced, and had some interesting items, like a range of specially mixed teas/juices in jugs (perfect for spiking with your alcohol of choice). \n\nThey really could do no wrong. We absolutely loved our stay, highly recommend it, and hope to be back soon!",

Well you just have to go yourself to find out!\n\nFrom the moment we arrived, the staff welcome you with genuine warmth. \n\nThe minimalistic entrance, the vertical gardens, and then the door is opened to your villa...... your spirit lifts and you know this is a special place.\n\nIt's not often that you find somewhere that looks as good, if not better than the marketing photos - but here you have found it - villa intoxication.\n\nThe understated luxury welcomes you and encourages you to unpack, relax, and enjoy every moment here.\n\nEnter your air-conditioned bedroom, unpack in wardrobes that are larger than you have at home. \n\nYour bathroom, filled with lotions for him and her.  That stone bath beckoning you to fill it with water and sink into it.\n\nThe glistening water of the pool, the loungers positioned in the sun, the green manicured lawn..... you have made the right choice choosing One Eleven.\n\nWhat about a spa treatment - well you have your own spa gazebo right next to the pool. They come fully prepared - even with soothing music - and massage away - bliss.\n\nBreakfast carefully prepared in your villa at a time of your choice, with a selection you choose.  We had the Indonesian  breakfasts, which were delicious.\n\nRoom service prepared from their own kitchen, was quickly delivered, and each time set up on the dining table in your outdoor living room.  Food was fresh, interesting and prepared with a sense of pride.\n\nLocation of the villas is great. As first timers to Bali and Seminyak, we enjoyed that the restaurants where close by, the shopping a mere 5 minute walk away, and yet we were cocooned in a private and peaceful location.\n\nNeed to get to book a restaurant - just ask and it will be done for you.  What time is your dinner the staff ask - a car will be waiting to drive you there.\n\nAbsolutely nothing is too much for the staff - is there anything further we can do for you they ask..... the difference here is that they actually mean it.\n\nSimple things, like a request for a lemon or lime for that G&T - delivered with a smile.\n\nDinner at the on site Japanese restaurant, was intimate, attentive and most importantly fresh and delicious. \n\nWould I change anything...... honestly no I wouldn't.  The luxury is provided, you have 24 hour room service, personal chefs to cook breakfast to you liking, your own huge pool, spa treatments and privacy to allow you to unwind from your daily stressful life.\n\nBut most of all you have the fabulous One Eleven staff - they are are the Diamond in a Cubic Zirconia world !!",

Not only was our villa everything we needed with its private pool and airconditioned bedrooms, but the staff at the One Eleven Resort are truly exceptional. They are extremely nice, and went above and beyond for us! Would definitely come back to try the couples only villas with my partner next time I come Bali, because the staff here are just incredibly pleasant and polite! ",

You would expect a smaller room.. A different furniture.. A smaller pool ..etc \nBut this villa was as pretty as the pictures.. Everything was clean.. The pool is soo big and amazing .. We had alot of fun in it .. The spa room and outdoor shower.. Everything was perfectly set.\n\nAnd the staff is professional, attentive, and helpful. And of course extremely nice like all Indonesian people.\nThey also were helpful regarding my religion, they provided female butlers to bring the food so my wife doesnt have to cover her head.\n\nThe food were good as well, and i loved that the chef came everyday in the morning to cook inside. \n \nThe location was PERFECT !\nYoure close (5 min walk)\nto the most famous street in Seminyak yet once  u enter One-Eleven its soo quiet.\n\nReally liked it for my honeymoon,\nAnd i really recommend it  ",

Negatives were that the air conditioning in the bedroom wasn't great and the lighting was so poor that I couldn't really see how I was applying makeup before going out in the evening. \n\nThe breakfast was just ok, the standard of food wasn't great, the pastries and bread were actually pretty bad. \n\nThe chauffeur service was really handy, they were always there to take us to a restaurant or to the spa during the day or evening. \n\nThe staff were very friendly and very helpful.\n\nI wouldn't recommend using their in house spa service though, we had massages which were ok but I did have the worst pedicure I have ever received, I took the polish off immediately. \n\nOverall I would still recommend staying here, just don't expect too much from breakfast!",

              "text": "The villas are very luxurious and the pool very generously sized. The service is impeccable, but that is to be expected from a property of this calibre in Bali. The cooking of the breakfast fresh in the villa by a member of staff was a lovely touch. It was also fantastic to have a shuttle car at pretty much our beck and call, although my husband did have some issues with this airport transfer, although this was not OneEleven's problem, rather an issue with the increased traffic for the end of Ramadan.\nI have not given it 5 stars for 3 reasons (all fairly minor but they did detract from our experience):\n1) Noise is an issue. The way the villas are designed they are mirror images of each other, rather than exact replicas. This meant that our lounge room (villa 2) was right next to villa 3's lounge room, meaning that when they had the radio blaring at volume 5 million, it was rather intrusive. Similarly, the pool lounges for villa 1 were right next to our pool lounges. Villa 1 were having a rather epic party, including squealing, dive bombing, loud music etc. When we rang reception to ask if they could ask them to keep it down, we were told there was nothing that could be done. To be clear, unless I misread the vibe terribly, these are not party villas!\n2) The sound system needs updating. The speaker does not connect via bluetooth and the USB did not work. The port was for an old style ipod. This meant that we (and our neighbours, because we could hear everything - see comment 1 above) could only really listen to local radio. Would have been nice to listen to our own music;\n3) The tiles on the villa side of the pool area are VERY VERY slippery. I had quite a nasty fall when I was trying to get a towel, and hit my head quite hard. Obviously not the villa's fault (except perhaps in its design!) but worth noting to take extra care.\n\nVery relaxing and lovely experience overall, would definitely consider it next time we are in Seminyak.",

              "text": "I've stayed in Bali more than 10 times now and a vast majority of them have been in villas like this one but i must admit that this one could be the best one yet for a number of reasons... \n\nFirstly, its located far enough that you dont hear the hustle and bustle of the main street but close enough for you to walk and enjoy the numerous restaurants and my favourite, Ku De Ta. \n\nFrom the moment you arrive, you'll be greeted by extremely friendly and genuine staff you'd ever be fortunate to meet. This continues all the way to the villa as everyone is extremely kind and happy to assist you in any way possible. Unlike other villas, this one provides airport pick ups and drop offs but also to anywhere you'd for free! We got a ride to numerous places and called for a pickup when we were done. \n\nWhich is pretty unheard of as only some 5 star hotels provide them for free. \n\nWhen you get to the villa, you'll notice just how lovely it looks. Very modern and clean.  As you walk in, you'll see the decent sized pool separating the living quarters. The room and bathroom are very clean which great for an OCD person like myself. The amount of lotions and hair products on offer is plain ludicrous and i had to stop my significant other from stealing them all. Wise men reading this, dont stop them. trust me, its not worth it. Calling them greedy is also unwise as i learned the hard way. \n\nNever come between a woman and her toiletries they say... \n\nif there was one thing that wasnt top notch, it was the air conditioning. it wasnt as cold as we'd have liked it to be. \n\nThe food is pretty good although not amazing but thats fine as you'll have plenty of options just a couple hundred meters away. \n\nAll in all, its a perfect place to stay and i would definitely come back. And that says a lot as I've never stayed in the same property twice. :)\n\nEnjoy!",

The room is split up perfectly, huge bathroom, tub, stand up shower. Everything is so clean and tasteful. We even got them to cook us a live barbecue in our villa, it was phenomenal. Oh and not to forget you have a glass massage room in the villa too, by the pool. Location of hotel is also perfect. It's a dream! Most definitely coming back. ",

I booked on a special that included dinner or lunch for two and two one-hour massages. Because I traveled alone, the resort allowed me to dine twice in villa and also gave me a 2-hour credit for massage.  \n\nFood: The breakfast is delicious and since everything includes 2 people, I was able to select two breakfast entrees (the fruits, breads, coffee, tea is already included).  The spread was to do for and the chefs were never obtrusive while they cooked.  I also got dinner in-villa twice and the food quality and presentation was fantastic.\n\nMassage: Great - unobtrusive masseuse and so convenient to walk right from the living area to your own private massage room!\n\nService/Facilities: A++++ I used driver service to watch the sunset at Potato Head Beach Club and they dropped me off and picked me up! Additionally, the villa is beautiful and has everything you need for a beautiful holiday.",

The villas are so aesthetically pleasing and built so amazingly that it truly feels like a get away despite the fact that the location is in central seminyak which is quite a happening place. \n\nThe staff was Excellent and very very accommodating, going to the extent of especially arranging Halal food for us during our stay by changing suppliers as usually the meat is not Halal. Special Thanks to Deni and Mr. Saifuddin our butler who helped us and facilitated us in every way possible from arranging a local remedy when i was not feeling well to prompt room service at 3:00 a.m. in the morning and even suggesting and arranging local tours for us. \n\nThe pool is perfect and private. The daily breakfast menu is amazing and the daily turn down desserts are a nice touch\n\nI would highly recommend this to all and do make sure to get in touch with the staff before hand so that they take extra good care of you. Our honeymoon was truly ethereal and still feels like a dream. Thanks to One Eleven Villa for making it possible.",

              "text": "We were there for holiday in early June 2015 and stayed for 3 nights. They were so patient and courteous from the time I corresponded with them via email until the day of our arrival. The drivers were waiting for us at the airport arrival hall when we landed at close to midnight. Although it was very late, they didn't show it and still greeted us with enthusiasm and smiling faces and even have cold towels and small bottle of mineral water prepared for us to freshen up. \n\nThroughout our stay there, it was the little things that make us feel welcome, appreciated, without being intrusive.\n\nLocation\nI couldn't have chosen a better place and location. It's right at the heart of Seminyak, where it's lively at night and still out of the hustle and bustle; in a back lane, about 10 mins walk from the main street.\n\nThere are tons of shops to explore along the main street and a number of nice restaurants for you to dine. If you walk further down, you will come to Seminyak Square, where you can take a ride with Kura Kura bus and explore other areas such as Kuta, Sanur, Nusa, Jimbaran and etc.\n\nOn our last night, we decided to explore further down the main road of Seminyak and 15 mins later, we arrived at Ku De Ta. \n\nTaxis are easily available there at all times and do use the meter and select the ones that belongs to corporate.\n\nHotel\nThis is an all adult only hotel with 9 private one room villa with pool. Both its interior and exterior are modern and yet unassuming. There is the well-known Shiro Sushi Sake restaurant, which, unfortunately, we didn't manage to try at all. \n\nYou could arrange with reception for driver to send and drop you off around Seminyak and pick-up later. This is subject to availability of driver.\n\nRoom\nWe loved the one bedroom villa and its privacy that comes with it. The lap pool is big enough for us to do some laps. There are deck chairs and towels for the pool that you can use and laze around the pool. In front of the pool is a gazebo in the villa and you can arrange for your own personal spa.\n\nDining room and kitchen are outdoor and mosquito coil and spray are provided too when evening comes. Kitchen is fully equipped with utensils, fridge, plates and bowls that you can buy food back, if you wish. There is self-complimentary Nespresso machine and TWG teas. Umbrellas are available should it rain. \n\nRoom is spacious and the bed and pillows are heavenly. We even enjoyed the rain shower. There's even complimentary amenities provided; shampoo, conditioner, bath gel and soap for man and woman.  \n\nIn-villa services\nWe thoroughly enjoyed the luxurious daily breakfast that comes with the package and daily turn down service.\n\nService\nThe staff are friendly and professional, yet humble and very much like a family. They always greet or smile at us. Service is always top notch. We received a thank you email from David, the GM, a day after we arrived back home. \n\nIf I am to nick pick, I'd say that the roof needs to be repaired as it was leaking when it rained and the Yamaha multimedia player is out-of-date. I would suggest that this be replaced with another player that is bluetooth enabled instead of using a specific usb that can only be used with iPhone or Android. As for the gazebo, it can be a little hot in the afternoon.\n\nOverall, we are happy with our stay here and hope to go back again soon.",

              "text": "Stayed July 2015, Wow what a gem in Bali.  From the moment you are picked up from the airport, with cold water and fresh cold towel until you are transported into the most amazing villa you have ever seen.\n\nTotally private, huge with the pool and garden area the same size as the villa.\nThe villa has everything you need:\nThe maxi bar, everything free with the exception of alcohol and snacks.  A delicious treat supplied daily.\nThe bathroom is wow with everything you need, shower gel, shampoo, toilet paste and brushes, razors, sunblock and mosquito repellent.\nEvery evening the butler provides the breakfast menu for the following day, and my how wonderful it is, cooked dish, cereal, yoghurt, breads, fresh fruit, fresh daily squeezed juices and tea, coffee.  It really is enough to last you until dinner.  All prepped in the villa.\n\nThe staff come in twice a day to clear up, but you would never know they are there.  All very attentive.  I personally believe they are one of the biggest and best things about your stay.  Cater for your every whim.\n\nI celebrated my birthday and our 25th Wedding Anniversary and boy did they push out all the stops for it.  I won't spoil what was done, in case you think of celebrating too, but believe me you wouldn't miss it for the world.\n\nYou also have a spa gazebo in your garden, where you can have as many and little spa treatments you like.  Lovely touch when we left, we were given a CD of the music they play during these treatments, very relaxing.\n\nSeminyak it a very vibrate place, the villas placed just off the road, there are nine villas, we stayed in No 8.  I don't think I would like villa No 1, as too near the road, although we didn't really here anything.\n\nIf you want to go out on day trips, One Eleven will organise and travel.   The in house drivers will also transport you to local areas.  My husband broke his glasses and they kindly arranged to go to the Opticians and arrange some birthday gifts - nothing was too much trouble.\n\nShiro, Japanese restaurant is wonderful, I love Japanese food and my husbands first time, but he has now been converted since the special dining experience.\n\nI can't pin point the best bits because it truly is wonderful, but the staff go a long way to ensuring your experience is the best ever.  I really hope we manage to go back one day.",

From the moment we stepped in the villa's car at the airport which was provided for free, we have started an amazing journey at One Eleven. Cold towels and ice water were immediately provided to welcome us. And the freshly prepared in-villa breakfast that we had every morning from the next day was consistently great and the amount of food was just perfect. Every staff at One Eleven was always very happy to help, for even a request of local SIM cards that I wanted to get for both my husband and me. The layout of the villa is simply gorgeous and modern. The beddings are so comfortable that we had to sleep until 10 every morning! :) The pool is long and deep enough to have a real good swim. The location of the villa is also great as a lot of nice restaurants and shops in Seminyak are only in walking distances. A CD with beautiful and relaxing Bali music was given to us as a complimentary gift when we checked out \u2013 this is such a sweet service as we can still go back to the days when we were in Bali in our memories when enjoying the music at home! The price for One Eleven may look a bit high but I can assure you that it is worth every penny! One Eleven is definitely the best choice in Bali for a couple that would only wish to enjoy pleasure and privacy in a romantic trip! Highly recommended!!",

Despite staying only 1 night, we booked 2 nights so that we could spend the whole of Sunday enjoying the villa. \n\nThis villa, although booked hurriedly was the best choice I had made. Not only were they great at accommodating an early check in for us, they even had breakfast prepared for us as we arrived at the villa. The villa itself was modern and clean, exactly the type of decor we appreciate and feel comfortable in. Everything was very well thought of. God is in the details here from the welcome drink to the toiletries in the bathroom which were just lovely.\n\nWe even had time to book 2 massages and due to the inclusive car service were able to visit a few warungs to try some local food. Absolutely exceptional service by all the staff, butlers and massage therapists. I would highly recommend this to all couples.",

First, my flight arrives at 6:00 am in the morning and the villa driver pick me up with an ice cold towel ready for me in the car.  I requested for early check-in and they could accommodated my request since I was taking a redeye flight.  After I arrived at the hotel, I was directed to my villa right away without stopping at the check-in desk.  All the check-in process was done inside the villa.  \n\nThe villa is gorgeous.  You have a big private swimming pool, an open living room with kitchen, a big bedroom with a very nice bathroom.  The special thing is that you have your own massage room. \n\nService is exceptional great.  Our room was make-up every time we stepped out of the villa.  They offer complimentary ride services to the local places.  This is an excellent experience.",

Very modern and sleek with nice quality furnishing, sound system and a spectacular pool!\n\nBut the thing that really sets One Eleven apart is the level of service. Every person we dealt with was so kind and friendly, trying to help in whatever way they could and always with a nice big smile! Attention to detail was unparalleled, nice little touches everywhere, from amenities which even included mosquito repellent and his and hers body lotions, shampoo etc. to the villas being cleaned/towels changed several times a day but never intruding while we were in the villa.\n\nBreakfast is cooked and laid out in your own villa at the time you request it. It is varied and delicious. We also had lunch served in the villa once and it was just great especially their Indonesian inspired food. \n\nI have never enjoyed a stay in a hotel more! In fact, it was so nice that we hardly left the villa. If you do leave, the resort is very close to Seminyak's main drag where you can find many cool restaurants and shops. If you decide to stay in for dinner there is also a delicious sushi bar with a Japanese chef on the premises which I would also recommend. \n\nMy only constructive criticism is that some of the wood panelling in the ceiling in our villa had a bit of water damage and one stool in the massage room had a large stain. Just little things that could easily be rectified but that did not detract from the fantastic experience. \n\nOverall I would very highly recommend the One Eleven Resort!",

              "text": "Stayed at One Eleven during Christmas last year, and LOVED (almost) everything about our stay. We were recommended to stay at One Eleven by word of mouth, and simply do not regret it at all. It's a perfect place to relax, unwind, and get some R&R. The only one regret was that our trip was not long enough in Bali, because we loved it so much it was hard to leave and we had booked all these restaurants which meant we didnt get to try One Eleven's Japanese restaurant, Shiro. We'll definitely be back though! Overall, we felt that this was one of the best places we have every stayed at on holiday and well worth every penny spent.\n\nPros:\n1. Location - tucked away off the main street in Seminyak, it's just a five minute walk out to the hustle and bustle of Seminyak. We experienced no noise disturbance during our entire stay, it was so quiet despite most the villas being occupied.\n\n2. Service - Absolutely impeccable. Everything was taken care of - even the little details. Our butler ensured that we were incredibly spoilt during our entire stay. Our favourite breakfast orders were memorised, and we were asked what we'd like the evening before for breakfast the next day. I loved the little night time desserts that were left for us every night - especially the Indonesian desserts! We received cute little cupcakes and cakes during Christmas. When staff members saw that we were walking out to Seminyak, we were asked if we would like a shuttle. Room was kept immaculate, our clothes even folded and placed neatly. We were incredibly spoilt. Every morning, breakfast was cooked to order and the selection was huge - there was no way we could finish everything we were plated. \n\n3. The Villa: all I can say is, WOW. From the design, the spa bale, the huge pool, the bathroom complete with huge bath tub, the outdoor patio area which was big enough that despite the villa not having gym facilities, I managed to do a bodyweight workout in that area every morning as it was big enough!...we could have actually just spent all day in the villa itself going from sun lounge, to pool, to patio lounger. Brilliant! I love the his and hers bathroom amenities which even included mosquito repellent and sunscreen, and differently scented toiletries. \n\n4. Spa: our stay included complimentary spa treatmentsin our private spa bale. The weather was pleasant enough that we didn't even need to have the air conditioning and it was amazing to have the spa bale doors open, with the cool sunset breeze coming in as we were getting pampered. Truly memorable.\n\nIf, and only if, I had to criticise would be the inflexibility of the meals that were part of our paid package - for example: for lunch, you could choose an appetiser, main and dessert. However, both my husband and I, generally don't take dessert but instead we asked for an extra serve of one of the mains. We were asked to pay for the additional - which is fine by us, but found it unusual that since we both already mentioned ahead by email before we arrived that we both would not like to have dessert, it would make sense to just let us have an additional main in replacement. \n\nWe cannot wait to return!",

Please rest assured that this would of course be possible and I have addressed this matter with the team.  \r\n\r\nThank you again for the detailed review of your stay and we do hope to welcome you back in the future.\r\n\r\nWith best regards\r\n\r\nDavid",

              "text": "I had the pleasure of staying at One Eleven for six nights with a friend in October 2014. The stay was superb.\n\nI understand that the villas all have essentially the same design; an open plan kitchen and living area with an enclosed bedroom and bathroom area. The aesthetic quality of the villas exceeds even the professional photos on the website.  The furniture and wood paneling give the place a sense of luxury. Fresh flowers were placed every day. Lying around in the villa was a pleasure. \n\nThe linens are crisp and fluffy, and there is extensive hanging space. The extremely stylish bathroom has a beautiful bath, and a rainforest shower that provided the best water pressure we found in Bali. \n\nThe bathroom amenities are the best I\u2019ve encountered in any hotel, anywhere, and included mosquito repellent to take with you (which was extremely useful) and sun care products. \n\nThe villas are designed in a way that ensures a sense of privacy- you press a button to allow staff to enter. This really makes you feel like the space is your own.\n\nThe staff are delightful. Pleasant when you pass through reception, and (almost) never over bearing.  Everything was a phone call (or touch of a button) away. I was amazed that two mornings the villa was fully serviced and cleaned while we were having massages in  the  villa\u2019s bale- it was silent, and perfect.\n\nWhile the breakfast is nicely executed in villa, we preferred walking down to La Lucciola for breakfast. The fruit and bread were lovely, but we found the hot options and cereal a bit underwhelming.\n\nSpecial mention has to go to the \u201cextras\u201d. Our package included generous allowances for spa services. These were beautifully done in the villa\u2019s bale.  I had best the best massages of the trip. The room service menu, which is a 24 hour service provided a couple of lovely lunches and cold beers. The free local shuttle was also excellent.\n\nI felt that One Eleven also provided excellent value. The food, drink and spa had prices quoted inclusive of tax and service. These prices were considerably lower than the other accommodation in Bali. I never felt ripped off, or as if I was being taken advantage of for staying in fine accommodation.\n\nMy only irritations were that staff had a bad habit of phoning the villa unnecessarily when the privacy button was switched on. This meant you had to get out of the bath or pool to run to the villas single phone (which was inevitably somewhere off the hook). I would highly suggest that staff adopt a higher threshold to make a phone call. I got in the habit of asking them not to call me back when I had a non-urgent question or enquiry, because it was really too much. Most memorably, I was contacted late in the evening prior to departure to enquire when I was to have my included in villa three course meal, when it was perfectly apparent that there was no opportunity left to use this.\n\nOverall though, this was easily the best accommodation I stayed at in Bali. The accommodation with its lovely ambience was the most expensive, but the ancilliary services (food, spa, transport) were easily the cheapest and best quality.",

A five minute walk to the main street for restaurants and shopping, this resort was ideally located.\n\nThis is a boutique group of Villas serviced by five star butlers and staff. The Villas are very luxe, minimalist and super stylish. The pool is large for a one bedroom villa and we enjoyed lazing by the pool with some tunes playing working on our tans. One Eleven forces you to relax.\n\nThe bed is extremely comfortable, bathrooms are large and there is an abundance of free amenities from sunblock, after sun, insect repellent and the usual standards. The Villas are spacious and have absolutely everything you need and if by chance they don't, the butler will get it!\n\nThe stand out at this villa was most certainly the staff. Our butler Agus was a beautiful gentleman and left no stone unturned. From restaurant bookings, cocktails, chauffers and suggestions Agus only had to be asked once. We will miss you Agus. Also Tina, the front desk Manager, always waiting with a smile and again, no stone left unturned.\n\nThe food at One Eleven was delicious. From the daily breakfasts cooked fresh in your villa ( we loved that you could add or request anything), room service menus even the cocktails were delicious. A highlight is Shiro Japanese restaurant, amazing sushi and sashimi. The timber fit out is also very luxe.\n\nAnd lastly, the in-house treatments were the best we've had in all our years of travel. Ris, you just hit all the right spots! I cannot recommend the in-house massage, facials and treatments enough, the team is professionally trained and seriously sent us to bliss!\n\nThank you to David and the team for a really fantastic week. Ive been listening to the complimentary CD you gave us on departure all week and Bali dreaming again! One Eleven is a very well oiled machine with lots of charm and warmth.\n\nWe cant wait to come back next year. \n\nTerrie and Mark - Melbourne",

Transfers to and from the airport, a foot bath on arrival, Spa treatments, dinner reservations, golf reservations, towels checked and replaced twice daily, every detail taken care of. Each morning breakfast is prepared in your villa, a good choice of options fabulously cooked and carefully presented. The villas are super, tastefully decorated in a modern style. We found that it was only a short trip to some of our favorite restaurants and a driver will take you anywhere in Seminyak. The location is near to the centre of the town and yet it's quiet, tranquil and private. The villas all have private swimming pools which are great and Spas for a wonderful relaxing massage without having to leave your villa!\nThe service is exemplary and the attention to detail excellent, an example is the bathroom amenities which include sun-block, after sun and mosquito repellent.\n1 11 is the perfect place to relax and unwind, we will definitely be back and highly recommend it.",

The villas are simply amazing, tastefully decorated in Japanese modern style: in the centre of the town and yet separate from the rest and with 100% privacy and tranquillity, they are made of a stunning living room, which is open and has  a beautiful kitchen (where every morning the staff will be preparing the breakfast only for you), a big and comfortable bedroom tastefully furnished, a beautiful and big bathroom, a private swimming pool where you can really swim (it is longer than 10 meters) and, last bat not least, a private spa for each villa.\nThe service is excellent and personalized (there are only 9 villas), a butler will take you everywhere in Seminyak and arrange everything for you. In this respect, the staff is very prepared and provided us with very good and much appreciated suggestions. Among other things, for instance, they arranged for us the driver-guide who took us around for many days in Bali.\nThe attention to the detail is Japanese-style (including the service to the guest), and the guest is pampered in every possible way. Among other things, we found a beautiful and very good cake in the fridge since it was our anniversary, and the amenities of the bathroom are simply amazing (including sun-block, which is very useful in Bali, mosquitoes repellent and many other things).\nSumming up, the 111 is the perfect place to pamper yourself completely, I had a lovely stay and highly recommend it.",

However, I am glad to say One Eleven led by David Beevers and his team have definitely surpassed all my expectations. The villas was of course of super high standard, with all the comforts to make my stay so comfortable. The staff have been trained so well and have been so obliging of my request especially the day when I decided to do nothing but stay in the villa enjoying the pool and all the spa treatment, the staff went to the extend to help me buy my favourite famous Baby Guling Lunch and have it delivered to my villa.",

              "text": "We had high expectations for One Eleven, partly driven by the price and partly driven by the stays at the other Bali and Lombok luxury resorts we had already stayed in as part of our honeymoon in Indonesia.\n\nThe service was outstanding, as it was everywhere we stayed and came to expect in Bali and Lombok.\n\nThe villas are beautifully designed but in some aspects it felt like style over substance. Bedside lights were only accessible on one side of the bed for example and the sofas and dining chairs looked great but felt uncomfortable to relax in. When it comes to the breakfast, there are only two Western choices and one Indonesian main choice, which seems a little restricted particularly when we stayed at a 5 star boutique hotel resort in Ubud with unlimited cooked to order breakfasts with 10 choices and the quality of the food there was as good as any we have had in London. Little things perhaps but when charging luxury prices, the villas need to be luxurious in every way.\n\nThe worst thing about the resort however is that whilst it is marketed as a 'get away from it all' place where you can hide away from the world in a retreat with private spa treatments in  your villa, the noise from other residents can be a problem. We were unable to enjoy our massages in our villa or relax by our pool due to residents who played loud dance music from 8.30am in the morning from the ipod dock and speakers provided. The staff were quick to ask them to turn it down when asked but we could still hear the music and  hear them shouting in the pool. Either this is a resort for rest and relaxation or it is a party place, it can't really be both.\n\nAs I said, service and staff were excellent and perhaps we were unlucky on our stay but there is work to be done to clarify the issues that would really make this property excel.\n\n",

On this occasion, this was not adequately explained to you and I will certainly address this matter with all concerned to ensure that it does not happen again. I will also look at increasing the number of dishes on the breakfast menu, which is changed daily but offer our guests a greater selection of dishes.\r\n\r\nI would also like to apologise for the noisy neighbours experienced during your stay.  Generally, our guests respect the privacy and convenience of others and this is not a regular occurrence. Regrettably, on this occasion they did not and we will certainly try to ensure as best we can, that others do not disturb the relaxation of our guests in adjoining villas. \r\n\r\nWe are disappointed to hear your opinion on our furniture as we have received mostly positive feedback on this aspect of our villas. However we do respect your feedback and we will continue to look at ways in which to meet the needs of all and further improve the comfort for all our guests. \r\n\r\nWith regards to the easy access of the light switches in the bedroom, I do appreciate your comments and thus have installed in each villa a remote lighting control switch that we hope will improve the convenience of our guests. I will also ensure that in the future, our butlers pay special attention when highlighting this feature to our guests on arrival.  I will also look at other possible enhancements for the lighting controls and see what can be done.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the matters raised, I do hope that overall you enjoyed your stay at One Eleven and Bali and I would like to thank you sincerely for staying with us. \r\n\r\nWith best regards\r\n\r\nDavid",

The only regret is that there is no shade at the swimming pool and the breakfast menu is limited. Other than that it was really good. Even the cute lizards that appear from time to time, surprisingly, I didn't get bitten by mosquitoes, and after washing with the provided amenity shower gel, my body glowed. It's about and ah true! If you have a tour and need to go out early in the morning, tell us and they will pack a breakfast for you in advance. It's really the best!!!",

Having been to Bali many, many tines, and staying in various pool villas over the years, this is our top of the list.\n\nThe location is perfect. The villa grounds and pool are massive. House Keeping team was impeccable. The food was fab. The shuttle service was handy. And the staff where amazing! A big shout out and thank you to Komank, Lawya, Mira and Udin (and the Security Team) who all looked after us and our every need and made us feel like we were coming \u201chome\u201c at the end of each excursion. Highly rated and recommended by us \u2013 just go! You too will love it (it\u2019s simply impossible to not love this place as nothing is missing or lacking!!)\nThank you One-Eleven! \nJohn & Kate",

Not much mosquitoes at all unlike other resort we stayed before. \n\nUdin our butler was not only kind and excellent, but even went out of his way to let us try local delicacies when we told him about it. \n\nThey rotate breakfast options. Cooked right at your villa. Served hot. \n\nHe also arranged and advised the timing of our breakfasts on our last day to ensure we get to the airport on time and unrushed. \n\nThey do make you feel at home and safe. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the TWG chamomile or the peppermint that did it, but everything was well thought of. Even the fridge we can use to put fruits and the water generously provided with dispenser! \n\nLoved how Sinta booked restaurants, arranged our transport around Seminyak for shopping, quick money change, and to even other Spas , although we did try their\u2019s too and it was lovely. \n\nLove their bath and body soaps, shower gels too. Nice natural combinations. \n\nWe left well rested, & happy !",

The service from the whole team could not be faulted from the delicious daily breakfasts to the front desk who were always there to help with requests no matter how big or small.

              "text": "3 nights here after a few days in the jungle.  Fantastic villas - now 11 years old so showing their age in a couple of places,  but really pleasant and comfortable - the photos dont quite do them justice.  Staff are fabulous,  so attentive and helpful without being intrusive.  Nothing's too much trouble.  A shuttle is available to local attractions.  Seminyak's a bit so so - tourism is coming back but it's far from busy - it must be very difficult in this part of Bali when tourism is at its height.   Daily in room breakfast is a highlight - delicious and 'just enough'.\nThere are only 2 concerns that we have with One Eleven.\n1. The bed covering is too thick - the doona is what we would have for a cold night in southern Victoria - forces you to push the air conditioning really hard which seems silly.  And even then you're still hot.  Some lighter weight bed covering would help.\n2. You're really vulnerable to neighbours who choose to be noisy,  as one of ours did one afternoon,  playing music that let's just say it wasn't too our taste.  The staff did respond to our request to reduce the volume but let's just say it seemed to get louder later in the day.  Rather spoiled an in house massage that we'd booked for that day.   The living area as you can see from the photos on this site is very open and basically abuts the neighbors' living area.  Simple solution is to remove the Bluetooth loudspeaker that each villa has in its living area - or put it in the bedroom ( which is well soundproofed).\nShiro,  the on site Japanese restaurant is terrific - loved our (largely Sushi) meal.\nOn balance,  a fabulous place to stay and very happy to recommend it.   \nJust a couple of simple things to fix.\nAnd hope you dont have noisy neighbors.",

The pool is so big you can actually have a proper swim in it - the best way to start your day :) . The villas are located in the quiet part of the Seminyak, but still close to many great restaurants, cafes yoga studios, shops and beach. Last but not least - the staff was super helpful and friendly. They were doing their best to meet all of our requirements as soon as possible. Big thank to the whole team of 111 Bali for the great and unforgettable experience!",

So no, the title is not an exaggeration. \nI\u2019ve stayed in lots of villas in Bali, but nothing came close to this one. Everybody was just so friendly, accommodating, and always smiling, it feels amazing to be welcomed with such friendly faces.\nThe service at one eleven is impeccable, everyone really went above and beyond to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. I could call the receptionist at 4am this morning because of a terrible headache and they provided me with painkillers.\nThe villa itself is just beautiful. It\u2019s spacious, much bigger than most villas. What I liked the most was how the villas actually have some green area and not just a swimming pool and walls like typical Balinese villas. The villa was also spotless. The speaker in the living room was broken on my first night, but they fixed it straight away the morning after.\nMy heart broke when I had to end my stay, it was just very dreamy.\nA massive thank you for all of you lovely people who work at one eleven. Hope I will get to see yous soon! ",

I got another villa this time but very similar and loved every minute. The privaely cooked breakfast, their buggy rides from the villa to the reception (lol,) the beautiful pool, spa pavillion, amazing bathroom products are all wonderful. I consider this the only place to stay in Seminyak and need Seminyak when in Bali for shopping and dining. The only thing I'd change would be to ask the resort to offer a scent free option for sheets/robes/bath towels. (I'm heavily allergic to scents.) Apart from that it's an amazing place and I always feel my stay is too short.",

              "text": "Where do i start. If you are reading this thinking about booking. DO IT . I stayed here for 5 days 4 nights and i can not fault this place here are my reasons.\n\n1) I loved how clean the villas are: When holidaying for me the most important is cleanest plce (i\u2019m OCD , clean freak, so i tend to be very very picky and never stay below 5 stars for that reason). Being OCD, which is my problem, the staff would do anything to make it reach my expectations from changing linen more than once to extra towels and evening cleaning service (thats how bad i am) so rest assured really clean.\n\n2) Service; my butler was Kadek. I stayed in Dubai Naseem Juierah (sister resort of Burj Arab-google it and see what i am comparing to) and the service from kadek and this hotel is unmatchable. \nOne Eleven was def better. I had friends at W hotel who were very jealous of my villa and what i was telling them. Things like sunscreen, Aloe vera gel all were included (so nice and courtesy). Kadek also arranged all my tours and last but not least offered me a ride on his bike when taxi was not available. Thank you to one eleven. \n\n3) A Good hotel is easy to find (they need to and is business as usual) but the BEST hotels know how to deal with issues/problems/complaints that happen which may happen at times as no one/any place  is NOT perfect. \n\nI had 2 unfortunate issues (not in hands of the one eleven it was pure luck) i will not go into detail. The manager testa i think was AMAZING. Listened Assisted and resolved. The Fact they have no bad reviews is a testimony to how they are dealing with the issues (promptly,  empathetic and above and beyond). \n\nI also read the average reviews given to this resort. Just a reminder ur in the heart of seminyak but inside the villa feels like ur in your own sanctuary. There will always be external factors but i never had them at all (noise). I can not understand how someone can rate this plce below 4/5 . \n\nI am coming back for my honeymoon.\n\n",

Love love love that breakfast is cooked in your villa kitchen - fresh bacon and eggs served up in your own villa. Very spoilt! And massage pavilion in your own villa - perfect for couples.",

From the pick-up at the airport to the assistance in booking restaurants/massage and the very convenient shuttle service around Seminyak. Concierge/Service/Butler team were extremely efficient and attentive to our needs and reverted to my bookings within minutes.\nOur bathroom tap was a little wonky and the air-conditioning was a tad too hot for my personal liking but the great service outweighed all these minor issues. Location is also great although the villa is a little obscure (its 2min walk from Ultimo and there's convenient store next door to the villa (where i bought my beer) - the shuttle service the villa provides is super convenient for getting around. If coming back to the villa from anywhere around seminyak its only around IDR2,000 by Gojek/Grab.\n\nHighly Recommend! Thanks for everything :)\n\nJulian",

My husband and I just loved the modern clean cut decor and style of the villa, precisely what we love. \n\nWe loved having our own pool and the flamingo float gave it a little quirkiness. \n\nThe bedroom and bathroom was wonderful. Loved the breakfast crew. Service was amazing and food was good too. We never got a chance to order room service unfortunately. \n\nHad the Omakase at Shiro Bar on our first night. It was ok but we have had better Japanese restaurant. Would have probably been better to order room service and spend more time in the villa instead. \n\nWe had two massages during our stay and the masseuse were really good and professional. \n\nWe loved how peaceful and quiet the villa was and how it was conducive for a wonderful quiet weekend away. \n\nOnly downsides were the aircon in both the bedroom and spa house. They were not working well and were hardly cold despite it being at the coldest. But we have feedbacked to the villa and they will look into it. \n\nAlso got some mosquito bites during our stay so slather on the complimentary mosquito repellent. \n\nDefinitely highly recommend One Eleven and will come back again!

Upon arrival ,we were escorted to our One bedroom pool villa by the butler and everything exceeded our expectation. The bright tone of the color , the private pool, the kitchenette , the spa suite, the bedroom, the bathroom with sexy oval bathtub and the amenities added up the whole luxe vibes. Once we entered the villa, the privacy sets in. The kitchenette and living room is sleekly designed and spacious and the bed is stylish and comfy. The Bathroom is our favourite, generous in space, the amenities series from the cooling gel, the sunblock and many more and the cool part is they are all made naturally from fruits. Just perfect for the skin !. The bathtub was ovalish and love to soaked in there for hours.  Most of the time, we just chill and relax by the pool and swam around , they did give some cool floats and that made us easier to read our monocle magazines. Evening was so romantic, the dim light that shone the garden and the pool. Breakfast was personalized, the Chef came to our villa and cook to our liking. Could not ask for more. We love One Eleven Bali to the moon and back !",

              "text": "My friends and i stayed in the 3 bedroom penthouse and we had a great time. \nParticularly the service rendered by every staff there! Everyone was helpful and friendly, ensuring we had the best experience possible. \n\nSome of the key highlights: \n1. Breakfast Menu was changed daily and although we had only 4 pax, they still served us breakfast for 6 pax as the penthouse was made for 6 pax. Food quality was great and they always set up the breakfast so beautifully. \n2. Transfer service was offered as long as it is around seminyak, and transfer service to and fro the airport was certainly a plus point. \n3. Penthouse was huge and although the design could be better, i must say it was very comfortable for 4. We got to view the 1 bed room villas that they had and it was magnificent! \n4. Location was really good, 5 to 15 minutes walk away from key places of interests in seminyak, but it still felt private enough and not too noisy in the evening. There is a 24hrs convenience store next door and we got most of what we needed there. \n5. We booked for Spa session and they come right to your door step. The therepists were great and we even got a discount which made the spa sessions we had, very value for money. \n\nThings we felt could be better: \n1. TV in the penthouse is a tad too small for such a big living room area. we had to shift the sofa forward. \n2. 3 bedroom penthouse, but only 2 bathrooms, which are not huge. Hence i would not suggest having 6 pax in the penthouse, the wait for the toilet would have been a nightmare. we had 4 people, which made the toilet sharing alright. \n3. Pool was cold most of the time, you don't get a lot of sun over the pool. we do use the pool, but only during the noon when it was really hot, or the water, really is too cold. \n4. Would have been nice if the gazebo or penthouse has proper massage beds for our spa services. the massage was great and therapist were professional, just that our bedroom beds were just too soft. \n5. There were fans in the living room and dining area, but there is no way to control how strong the fan gets, only on/off. \n6. Nice kitchen and food prep area, will help if there are a couple more pots with proper cover so we that we can do more cooking.. \n\nWith that said, we will still go back cause this place is beautiful!",

We are all truly delighted that you enjoyed your time with us and found everything was of exceptionally high quality.\n\nThank you for your feedback regarding the plug points. In addition to the 3 point sliding rail socket next to the bed, we also have multi socket adapters available from front office. This should have been covered in the villa orientation and we do apologize that this wasn\u2019t communicated better to you. We have passed this on to the butler team who will make sure it's covered for all future guests.\n\nIt was our pleasure to be of service to you and thank you very much for staying with us. We look forward to welcoming you back in the near future. \n\nWith kind regards,\n\nSahan Amer\n",

The service was satisfying as well. However there are some semi-minor 'complains' 1. There are only 2 bathrooms in the 3br penthouse. This is quite unusual that 2 bedrooms had to share a bathroom.  Wasn't sure if this was advertised in the website or in the site we booked it from.2. There are very limited plugs in the room. There are only 1 or 2 plugs underneath the TV. I mean we have so many gadgets to charge overnight and this is quite an inconvenience.3. There were constructions happening on the ground floor starting from 8am. This was a holiday trip and we just wanted to sleep in. so unfortunately the noise woke some of us up.Other than that, everything was wonderful. The service was great. the staff was really nice.",

We are thrilled that you found the villa gorgeous and enjoyed the central location.\n\nWe do note your comments with regards to one bathroom connecting two of the bedrooms. While the One Bedrooms villas (being adult only) were designed with adults in mind, The Penthouse was designed to accommodate families. This is the reason for the interconnecting bathrooms so parents can be close to their children however we do understand the inconvenience if more than two couples are staying and will look into making this clearer.. \n\nThank you for your feedback regarding the plugs which we will look into and take you point into consideration. We are also very sorry about the noise disturbance which was caused by a one time kitchen project. It has now been completed and although we did try to minimize the disturbance, we do apologize for the inconvenience caused.\n\nOverall, we are happy that you enjoyed your time at The Penthouse, One Eleven and will look forward to welcoming you back. \n\nWith kind regards,\nSahan Amer \n",

              "text": "Our stay at the villa was enjoyable and we had a great vacation. \nThings to note: Spray on their insect repellent (its rather useful) and bring mosquito patch with you. There's a lot of mosquitoes. \n\nLocation - It's about 30mins drive from the airport and villa is located near to a lot of nice cafes and eateries. \n\nService -  Check-in was also smooth and fast. Front desk staffs were polite and service was great. From the pick up and shuttle drivers, front desk, room service and chefs. The overall service we received from the staff were great. They were helpful and friendly and was prompt to respond to any request we had. \n\nRoom - The villa was very spacious, clean and neat. Fan, aircon were working well. The outdoor sitting area was windy and quiet. Nice place to laze. Pool was clean and we brought our own float but without the pump. The service staff were nice to inflate it for us perfectly. The toiletries they provided were pretty extensive (it even include sunblock, insect repellent and cooling gel!)  The villa come with a pretty good bluetooth speaker so you can actually play your music while lazing at the pool. But of course had to keep the volume down so that it doesn't disturb the neighbouring villas (it can be pretty loud.) \n\nFood - food was great, we enjoyed our breakfast vey much. They provided snacks which we didn't have a chance to eat as we were out. We ordered for the BBQ for one of our night and it was pretty good as well. Though the skewers were a little dry and tough but the overall was good. \n\nMassage - we had the in-room massage and facial for 2 days and we enjoyed it very much. The massage room can be a little hot in the evening. One of the day we had it at about 4pm and the sun was shining straight my face. So its better to book it at about 5pm onwards. The masseurs were great and nice people. The price is also quite reasonable.  \n\nOther things to note - it rained on the last day of our stay and there were a lot of dirt being washed down from the rooftop into our pool. There were some wooden bits as well, guess the wooden rooftop corroded and the bits and dirt were coming off. So just check the pool before using it. \nBring lots of mosquito patch with you and spray on insect repellent. The villa do provide the insect spray and they come by to place the mosquito coil every evening. It reduces by a little but it doesn't seem to be able to keep the mosquito entirely off. There were a couple of them in our room and the bathroom, so just keep the room door closed as much as possible. \n\nOverall we had a great stay, we enjoyed it and would probably come back again.",

              "text": "Some years ago on another visit to Bali we watched the construction of One Eleven and were interested in its clean design architecture, open living and minimalist wow factor ambiance. For this reason we decided to say at One Eleven for our trip this year to Seminyak which was for 14 nights.\n\nThe friendliness and service of the staff really do encapsulate the passion they have in making sure every guests has a wonderful time. One of the hardest choices each morning is how you\u2019d like your eggs cooked. Here, nothing can be too much trouble and it has been the surprising little things that has been the most enjoyable for us such as; complimentary hotel rides to restaurants or local shopping spots, the complimentary sweet or savoury hors d'oeuvre left in the fridge, inflatable lilos for your private pool (or not) and the turn down service each evening. \n\nTwo dining recommendations I\u2019d strongly encourage if decision making was difficult for you while on holidays is to:\n1/  Experience Shiro, One Eleven\u2019s sushi and sake bar on level 1. It\u2019s only a very small space but a very impressive design with intricate wood panelling. Even more impressive is the Japanese cuisine both in presentation and taste that is prepared right in front of you; and\n2/ One Eleven offers an in-villa BBQ dining experience which is fantastic. The team set up a barbecue in your villa and you are treated to a indulgent cuisine which we opted for the surf and turf which included\nbreads, salads, fish, prawns, squid, ribs, wings, chicken satay and beef plus dessert and fresh fruit. Great value for money and no need to dress up fancy or leave your villa.\n\nLike all resorts and hotels in the tropics the weather elements can take its toll and One Eleven is no different with minor general wear and tear issues but everything is aesthetically pleasing, elegant and welcoming of your relaxing secluded get-away.\n\nI can not highly recommend One Eleven enough, it\u2019s well worth the quiet and tranquil peace of mind when trying to escape your home rat race. This is what vacations are about, doing absolutely nothing and loving it.\n\nIt would be remiss of me not to mention the most beautiful front of house staff member Rai who was amazing and would get any job in the world because of her natural fabulousness. Thank you sincerely Rai.",

Free shuttle service to anywhere in seminyak!\n\n Only negative is as there\u2019s only 9 villas you won\u2019t get a massive buffet breakfast like in most 5 star hotels but you do get a chef come and cook you breakfast which is pretty cool. Also you can hear the music from neighbouring villas when in the pool/lounge outdoor area, which didn\u2019t bother us too much but could bother some.",

We arrived at One Eleven late in the evening but even in the dark, walking into the villas the view / design exceeded all our expectations - they are stunning! The pool is perfect, the lounge area is huge and bedroom / bathroom really well designed - we especially loved the bed on the concrete block and the range of toiletries provided. \nHad a fantastic 5 days / nights - staff are super friendly and helpful, in-villa brekkie is  a really nice treat. \nThe villas are in a great location, super quiet and a nice retreat from the hustle and bustle of Seminyak, but worth noting that they are all open and next to each other, so you may hear your neighbours (this wasn\u2019t an issue for us)\n\nWonderful stay - would definitely recommend ",

We loved the giant private pool, how there's a private spa room in each villa, and how the whole space just flows together. We were also so impressed with how the chef comes to your room to make breakfast every morning. Many of the furnishings were even custom made for One Eleven, including the his and hers toiletry sets. The staff was very accommodating, and arranged both pickup and drop-off from the resort. On top of that, we hardly needed to arrange a cab getting around the area because the resort offers a complementary driver service around the Seminyak area (depending on availability).We were initially hesitant to book a place that wasn't on the beach, but we're really glad we chose this place. If you want to get the beach experience, it's easy to get to Potato Head or Ku De Ta and rent a chair.",

You loose revenue by this silly element so hope you will source some to ensure clients preferences are managed.\n\nTrue the villa's noise to interact with the others. I would remove the sound systems and do not choose V 8 or 9 as their lounges are close to each other so you listen to each other's conversations. \n\nWould I stay here again. Yes! Many choices in Seminyak however we were very happy here so would recommend.",

This was the most peaceful, relaxing and fabulous holiday we have ever had. The villa enclosure is simply stunning and everything, down to the bed linen, the pillows, the bathroom product, everything, is beautiful. I don't normally swim much but the pool is divine. A good size and the water a perfect temperature, refreshing, but not so cold that it's hard to get in. We had massages and other treatments in the gazebo, so beautiful to lie on the massage bed with the light breeze coming through the door and at the end to just be able to walk out of the gazebo and into the villa.\n\nThe breakfasts are simply delicious! You choose the night before which cooked breakfast you would like and the two chefs come in at the appointed time, lay your table, cook your breakfast then leave. Their attention to detail is extraordinary from the artistic layout of the fruit platter to the flower strategically placed on the food to turning the yoghurt round the right way so that the diner could see the label without having to lift a finger.\n\nThe service that the staff give is very warm, friendly, discreet, respectful, professional and thoughtful. The senior butler is the epitome of a senior hospitality professional who knows exactly what to do to make your holiday the most memorable ever. \n\nThe driver service is incredible, they will take you anywhere you want to go in Seminyak and then pick you up again when you call. \n\nThe senior butler provided some day tour options for us and then organised a driver to take us touring for the day. \n\nThe villas are most of the time peaceful and tranquil. We did have one loud neighbour for about two days and the rest of the time it was totally quiet and peaceful.\n\nMy husband and I will definitely be returning to One Eleven.",

              "text": "We stayed for 9 days and absolutely loved every minute. The 9 villas are all identical and all abolsutely stunning. The pictures almost don\u2019t do them justice. The sense of space in the lounge, bedroom and bathroom adds to the luxury of the villas. But it is the large clear, clean and refreshing pool that sets it off. There is also your own private massage gazebo in the garden. Each villa area is completely private - an oasis of calm in the heart otherwise busy Seminyak.\n\nIt is the staff though that make your stay at One Eleven. From the receptionist to your butler to the in-room chef, the housekeeping staff and the drivers, the people at One Eleven are so friendly and helpful and provide amazing service. Our butler organised tours and helped us throughout the week. The drivers would happily take us to restaurants or other places we needed to go and pick us up afterwards all as part of the service. Their friendly helpful tips were much appreciated. \n\nYou can\u2019t review One Eleven and not mention the breakfasts! Having your choice of breakfast cooked for you in your villa at a time to suit you is really really nice. It\u2019s even nicer when the breakfast is Michelin standard. \n\nAll in all staying at One Eleven villas makes for an exquisite 5 star luxury holiday - we will most definitely return.",

The downside for the penthouse villa is the noise as it's located just next to the road which can be noisy.  Shower head pressure is very weak which I guess this will not affect the other one-bedder villas since they are located on the ground floor.  Other than that, I highly recommend One Eleven.   Before your arrival, the friendly staff were already in touch with you to make sure all your needs are met and catered for.  Their services are just awesome!",

We are all truly delighted that you enjoyed your stay in The Penthouse at One Eleven.\n\nWe do appreciate your comments with regards to the shower pressure and we have had our team look into this as this shouldn't have been the case. The Penthouse is located away from the 1 Bedroom villas and although the concept is a little different, the service and standards are exactly the same and we were happy to see this reflected in your review.\n\nThanks again for choosing to stay at One Eleven and we look forward to welcoming you back soon.\n\nWith kind regards,\nSahan Amer\n",

              "text": "I chose One Eleven after scouring the internet for the best place for peace and relaxation and to celebrate our two-year wedding anniversary.  We planned to spend about half the money, but upon finding the consistent, outstanding reviews for One Eleven decided it was well worth it for what seemed like a guarantee on the most peaceful environment (One Eleven does not allow young children \u2013 a huge draw for us as we will not be at a pool with screaming children).  My husband works long hours at a stressful job and we intended to spend this vacation reconnecting and recharging.  We stayed 4 nights here.\n\nVillas \u2013 absolutely heaven.  They are even more gorgeous than they look in the photos.  The pool is huge and sparkling, the lush yard and gardens and palm trees are incredible.  The way the pool and garden lights up at night makes you feel like you are in a dream\u2026  The bed is literally on a block of concrete (no rocking or shaking due to crappy bed frames \u2013 my pet peeve as a light sleeper) and the king-size mattress and pillows are lovely (you have extra firm pillows in the closet) and relatively noise-proof villa with black out shades are about the best guarantee of a fantastic night sleep you can get.  I do not sleep in late and I slept in at least 2 hours longer  each day when we didn\u2019t set an alarm than normal. The gazebo for spa services is gorgeous.  Short of your own private island, this is hands-down the most beautiful place we've been and we love and appreciate design and aesthetics.  We spent a good portion of the vacation marveling at this.  All of the details (down to a neck bolster being provided for with the lounge chairs) are there.  I could have done with better lighting for makeup in the bathroom and rain shower heads aren\u2019t my favorite but in the scheme of things this is forgettable.  \n\nSpa services \u2013 I did three \u201cinvigorating\u201d 60 minute massages in the gazebo.  I would say they were about a 6.5 or 7 / 10 on massage quality and for the price I was totally happy with this (they work out to be about $30 USD after the discount \u2013 CHEAP).  Getting a massage to the sound of the wind in the palm trees and birds singing is magic.  If you open the sliding doors, the breeze blows through the gazebo\u2026.  Just imagine.  Sadly 2 of 3 of my massages were interrupted by noise issues (see noise below).\n\nStaff \u2013 the staff, like everyone says, is fantastic.  They clean and straighten everything up your room and freshen all of the pool and bathroom towels and robes unlimited and with a smile.  They offered to cook our breakfast before breakfast hours on our last day when we had to leave early for the airport without us asking.  Every time we called to complain about noise issues (maybe five times??), they were apologetic and worked to resolve them (see noise issues below).  The free shuttle to and from Seminyak and the airport was super handy, friendly, and comfortable.  I think we paid something like $30 USD for them to pick us up from our first stay in Ubud.  Anywhere you go, you can get a ride back by asking the restaurant to call 111 and send the shuttle back for you.  A GREAT amenity.\n\nFood \u2013 the food is good, not amazing, but good enough that we preferred the luxury of eating all of our meals except dinner at the villa even though we planned to eat breakfast and lunch out more often.  And we are picky about our food.  They provide an afternoon/evening snack each day.  We had dinner at Shiro one night.  It was good also, again not amazing, but good.  We\u2019d eat there again.  Convenient and fresh and not super expensive.  The \u201cminute steak\u201d and crepes at breakfast were the standouts, along with the fresh juice.  You get to choose from about 4 menu items per day (they change daily) the evening prior what you\u2019d like for breakfast and can either schedule breakfast then or call the next morning and get it made in your villa 30-45 minutes later.  7 am to 11 am.  It comes with a bread/pastry bowl, some muesli, yogurts, and delicious jams.\n\nLocation \u2013 the location is great.  You could walk anywhere if you wanted.  We picked OneEleven for the location in proximity to all the great restaurants but ended up eating all meals at the resort except dinners and barely leaving.  A shuttle will drop and pick you up anywhere for free if you don\u2019t want to get sweaty/dusty and you are dressed up for going somewhere nice.\n\nPro Tip \u2013 the only thing I forgot to bring was a pool raft.  Floating on a raft in that pool with my book was the only thing that was missing to make my vacation perfect (aside from the noise, again, see below).  When I called to ask the front desk where I could buy one, they HAD THEM AVAILABLE!!!  About twenty minutes later they delivered one, blown up and ready to go.  I couldn\u2019t stop laughing \u2013 it was shaped like a flip flop.  I called to see if they had another one longer (I am 5\u20199\u201d tall) and they brought another shaped like a soft pretzel, complete with the salt dots painted on.  I was laughing with the staff member who brought it in with a big smile.  35 years old, laying on a flip  flop and pretzel floaty with a Chivas Regal in my hand\u2026 My kind of life.  Kudos to the person who had the brilliance to buy these hilarious floats, they were the \u201ccherry on top\u201d of the cherry already on the top.  \n\nNoise \u2013 after all of the consistently good reviews and research I did, I am nothing short of shocked to be sitting here writing this after our trip.  Any single one (or two) of these events would have been fine on its own, but for me the sum total of the events seriously detracted from the stay and how much we were able to relax and enjoy ourselves.  Our expectations were set high by the incredible reviews (only 2 reviews complaining of noise since 2014).  The staff did everything they could to take care of each situation, however we felt purely uncomfortable by the end of the trip for all of the requests we had to make.  The staff granted our request for the villa furthest from the road and we were delighted.  The first morning we woke up to two solid hours of the most heinous kids screaming and yelling coming from over the walls of our villa (Villa 9) from a neighboring resort.  We called to see what they could do, if anything, and they offered to move us to Villa 6 at 2 pm.  We retreated to the bedroom to watch tv until it was over.  On the heels of checking in to the new villa, the neighbors at OneEleven had their music on loud, not blaring but loud, and right over the wall from where our lounge chairs were.  We requested the staff asked them to turn it down and they did.  The kid noise from the previous day was no longer an issue \u2013 it was distant and faint.  Later the SAME day, in the middle of my massage, the villa neighbors on the other side checked in and were what I will call \u201cyell-talking\u201d and being so ridiculously loud that I had to get up during my massage and make a third request.  They quieted down a LOT, however some people are loud no matter what they do.  They talked all night until after we went to bed.  We set our alarm especially early to wake up and have a little break from this.  They seemed like the \u201cgoing out late, sleeping in late\u201d type and so when their doorbell rang at 7 am for their breakfast my heart sank.  The staff rang their doorbell 7 or 8 times for about ten minutes until they woke up and answered.  They had talked continuously throughout the entire night and next morning in their living area of the villa.  By lunch time, I was tired of being an involuntary part of their never-ending conversation, it felt really intrusive.  \n\nI did not want to spend a second day in the bedroom of the villa and would have been willing to pack all our stuff and move a second time to get the quiet we came for.  When I called, the staff told me they were checking out.  I was relieved.  We enjoyed about 3 blissful hours of quiet.  I had a third massage scheduled later that day and in the middle of this massage for the second time, the OTHER  neighbors decided to FULL ON BLAST their club music, louder than the first time.   It covered up the little wooden flute music the masseuse had playing and I just laid there, resigned and done and completely incredulous.  My husband heard it and called and about ten minutes later, they stopped playing it.  I cleaned up for dinner, we left, returned and went to bed, woke up the last morning we were there to leave and had a quiet morning.  At this point I got back on TripAdvisor to re-read the reviews for OneEleven to see if I had missed something.  I don\u2019t know if we were the most unlucky people in two years or if others just don\u2019t write about their bad experiences.  The worst part for us was being left to be the judge of what is reasonable between our vacation desires and someone else\u2019s.  I really felt like some kind of referee based on all of the noise issues.  All of the noise carries and we seeked this place out for the reviews and quiet and were willing to pay a premium for it.  I do believe others just end up here without really understanding the type of environment the resort is attempting to create, and plug in their iPod feeling like king of the world and ready to party or spend all day night joyfully and loudly reconnecting with old friends.  Others (like us) show up with real expectations of peace and quiet based on previous reviews only to be seriously let down.  At a resort of this caliber, I would have really liked the staff to notice how much trouble we were having and take some leadership in the situation to make the situation right beyond just resolving the individual incidents as they continued to happen, rather than leave it in my hands to bring to them.  I felt like I was playing a game of Whack-a-Mole managing the noise issues.  \n\nWhen this place is good, it is absolute magic and soul healing.  It is somehow naturally incredibly quiet \u2013 no dogs, no traffic noise except in the very front, nothing but the beautiful wind in the palms and birds and gentle sound of the water in the pool.   There would be no issues if everyone was observant of how much noise carries and I think most people that stay here are this way.  When you are unlucky it is a big let down and not worth the money.  I would love to come back again and again for the rest of my life I loved it so much when it was quiet if I could just be sure that this stay was only one in a thousand stays.  In the end, I do believe we were simply very unlucky and maybe the exception.  I plan to stay here again in the future and when we do, I will return to update this review with (hopefully) the experience that most people have.  If it is another of the same, refereeing obnoxious noise problems to get the peace and quiet I expected, maybe it is simply time is to leave some less than stellar reviews to bring the overall picture back down to a more accurate one.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED\u2026",

The people are what makes this place special. They are kind, honest, unassuming. One Eleven was much the same. The villas are private, quiet, and centrally located so a 10 minute walk to the beach or a 5 minutes to shopping. Or you can stay there and not leave your villa. The staff are incredibly helpful, make breakfast every morning which was amazing. Private spa facility in our villa was great and we have a few massages there without needing to leave anywhere. My wife and I look forward to next May as we will most certainly be returning.",

It's a welcomed reprieve from the heat. \nThe bed, pillows and linen are wonderfully comfortable and we slept incredibly well every night of our 9 night stay. \nAll high quality amenities are supplied: sun block, after sun cooler, body moisturisers, shampoos and conditioners, shower gel and bath salts. The shower and bath are huge with fantastic water pressure so that if you desire a bath, the hot water doesn't run out. \nEach day you're given different breakfast choices and it is cooked in the villa kitchen and perfectly presented. The staff manage to do this very discreetly. There's no intrusion and you feel very secure and private within the high walls around the private garden, pool, massage pavilion and villa. Night time is tranquil, there's no noise, the garden lights up and the pool is at a perfect temperature for swimming all day and night. It is literally two steps from every part of the villa. \n\nThe staff are well trained and very respectful, attentive and eager to please. \n\nOne Eleven is approximately a 5 minute walk to the Main Street of Seminyak and 15-20minutes to the beach. \n\nEvery aspect of this property, location and service is excellent. \n",

There's a serenity to staying here which is completely the opposite experience to the busy and sometimes hectic pace of Seminyak. The staff are wonderful - they are attentive, engaged, beautiful and friendly. The rooms themselves are of course house-proportioned... most of your living area is out of doors and the bedroom and immense bath are in air-conditioned comfort behind glass. The privacy of the pool and the beauty of that courtyard with its integral private spa treatment pavilion are wonderful. You can walk to just about any of the great restaurants and bars in Seminyak... but you may find you don't want to leave your villa that often. The quality of the spa treatments is just exceptional - among the best in Bali. A minor, minor suggestion for improvement might be the breakfast which although it is freshly prepared every morning could be improved with a slightly more fresh approach... cooked breakfast is lovely but not always a great idea in the tropical heat. But we have to say that One Eleven was among the best hotel experiences we have had. A memorable stay.",

They do a great job of making sure everything you could need is covered - making your breakfast and coffee in the morning, driving you around Seminyak all day, and preparing the room and mosquito coils in the evening. Good location within Seminyak - easily walkable or they can drive you anywhere, but also 100% quiet in the villa. The villa itself was great - pool was larger than we thought, indoor space more than sufficient and well-appointed. They also do a good job with mosquito coils and fogging outside. Only miss was the sushi restaurant on-site - decent but not memorable.  Would highly recommend.",

              "text": "Wow. Wow. Wow! One Eleven in Seminyak is without a doubt one of the most beautiful villas we've ever experience in Bali. From the impeccably friendly and helpful service to our luxurious villa, my partner and I couldn't fault one thing.\n\nWe were blown away by everything during our stay, but a couple of things stood out. Firstly, the villa is impeccable in every way - it's beyond spacious with a private spa room, huge lap pool and amazing amenities. And secondly, the food was delicious. Each morning our breakfast was cooked right in our own private kitchen by the chef, which was very special. We also ordered room service from the extensive menu (you MUST try the traditional Indonesian chicken soup - the best I've ever had!), which didn't disappoint.\n\nNeedless to say, I will be recommending One Eleven to everyone and, hopefully, we will get to stay again in the near future.",

Your own private pool was by far the best!",

The experience is built on great foundations of location (5 mins walk to Semanyak square), simple, elegant villa design, quality amenities, exclusivity (there are just 9 villas in total) and an \"adults only\" maxim.\nIf you are looking for a private, intimate, full service experience then 1 11 stands head and shoulders above all others in the Legian / Semanyak area (based on 20 years of visiting Bali and living in Indonesia, staying in many differing styles of accommodation).\nThe staff were all extremely attentive, responsive and tirelessly helpful; if you want to be pampered then 1 11 is a great choice.\nHaving a driver service was also extremely useful and a great way for guests less familiar with Bali to get their bearings. \nAs per comments of previous reviewers, in-villa breakfast prepared by your private chefs is a nice touch and despite selections kept to a simple menu, staff were more than happy to accommodate specific requests.\nThis is a high end experience and is priced accordingly.  1 11 delivers.\nThe only minor detraction noted was simply the curse of operating in a tropical environment; maintenance and reinvestment in building and materials is a constant battle and 1 11 shows signs of ageing on villa fascia and decking.\nIt in no way detracted from the experience but is perhaps the only thing that holds 1 11 from being absolutely perfect.\nI would endorse 1 11 for couples seeking a private, intimate, pampered oasis with all of Semanyak's many attractions at your door, ready to be enjoyed by private driver or just on foot.\n\n",

Excellent. In-room dining and Shiro isn't outstanding in my opinion. Privacy isn't the keyword here.\n\nI haven't experienced luxury enough but this is one too much.

Everybody we came in contact with were exceptional. This was a happy place to work. \nWhen we arrived we were greeted by the GM and front office staff, offering us cool drinks and a genuine interest in us which made you feel special. We were ferried to our villa by golf buggy and shown around our villa having all features explained. The first glance was modern, beautifully minimalist and beautifully presented. These villas are exceptional , private and quiet. \nWe had booked for dinner at Shiro which is part of One Eleven, I have already reviewed this and is with out a doubt a wonderful experience so we felt that it had set the tone for our holiday. \nThe next surprise was breakfast which was prepared in our villa everyday at the time we choose. The night before we were asked what we would like and if there were any special requests. For instance I love a healthy vege and fruit juice as it  keeps my body in balance when I'm on holiday. I gave them the recipe and they were happy to make it fresh everyday, it was the best juice I have tasted and they used the best quality ingredients. They also sourced my favourite fruits which were included , beautifully presented peeled and cut ready for eating.\nWe just rang \u00bd hour or so before we required it, to let them know so they could prepare our breakfast which arrived with out exception with a team of genuinely lovely staff who were happy, smiling intelligent and excellent at their jobs . Everything is prepared fresh and cooked on site.\nWe enjoyed everything on offer from the great massages to an in villa dinner once again prepared by the very capable staff. \nThey provided a car when we went out to restaurants and to do a little shopping which was a godsend for my husband who was suffering with a bad knee and was struggling to walk long distances . We needed to buy some gifts for our grandkids and decided on kites.( I thought they would be easy to find) ?? I think we were driven to about 4 places and no luck, when we decided to give that idea away and go back for a swim instead we happened across a little stall that had kites displayed. So stopped to purchase. Our driver even made sure we weren't being over charged. On our way back to the villa we must of seen about 5 different shops all selling kites. As they say Sods Law!. \nThe villa pool is wonderful, large and big enough to do a little exercise or just cool off. \nOne Eleven Villas are a great place to relax and wind down. You can do as much or as little as you want. We did the latter enjoying the tranquillity and peace that was offered. Privacy was paramount. \nThis is a true 5 ***** experience. There is not one negative and we will be back. Thank you.",

              "text": "I am longing for the day I return to this wonderful villa. It was five days of absolute bliss. I\u2019ve stayed in a few pool villas in Bali and although all were lovely in their own way, One Eleven (for me anyway) was the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me. I was drawn to its sleek, contemporary design that\u2019s different to the usual villas on offer in Bali.  It\u2019s very cool, hip and conveniently located to many great restaurants and shops. \n\nAll villas are identical and are extremely spacious with a great outdoor space offering a beautifully manicured lawn where you can chase the sun. There\u2019s a separate spa gazebo which we didn\u2019t make use of. I personally would have preferred to have had a nice outdoor bale / daybed there instead. The sun lounges, although looked very funky, weren\u2019t the most comfortable to use. \n\nThe pool is a great size, much larger than other villas we\u2019ve stayed in and the depth is pretty decent too. Water temperature was perfect every day, not too cold.  Bed was comfortable, nice shower, huge bath and plenty of bathroom amenities. They have insect repellent in cute little bottles that you can throw into your purse or pocket. Make sure to ask for extra of these, they proved to be very handy when out and about.  We also had sweets waiting for us after dinner and a little gift beside the bed, very thoughtful and something we actually looked forward to each night.\n\nBreakfast is cooked in your villa and was always delicious. The chefs were all lovely and cleaned up after themselves immediately, leaving you to enjoy your meal. My only issue with breakfast is that each day you had to select from a menu with limited choices. There\u2019s an Indonesian, Western and sweet option.  I\u2019m a creature of habit when it comes to my breakfast and usually like to eat the same thing and thought it was a little odd I couldn\u2019t order my eggs cooked the way I wanted.  Hopefully they\u2019ll change this next time I come back. \n\nThis was by far the most relaxing trip to Bali we\u2019ve had and credit definitely goes to the amazing staff who were all so accommodating and assisted us with every single request. Each morning our lovely butler would ask us what our plans were for the day. He made all our restaurant bookings (always got a good table) and made sure a car was ready to take us to our destination (within Seminyak only). Vehicles were all modern and clean with the air-con running so it was nice and cool when you got in. Make sure you grab their business cards to give to restaurant staff etc who can call the villa and arrange for a car to pick you up. It was so luxurious to have this service and certainly took a lot of the stress out of making these arrangements yourself. There was always a car available. Everything was just so easy. They also arranged a car to take us to Bintang Supermarket where the driver waited for us while we stocked up on essentials. \n\nAirport pick-up and drop off is included in the price, both times very smooth, quick and hassle-free. When you arrive to the villas and need cash, ask your butler as they\u2019ll drive you to a reliable, honest bank nearby with good exchange rates. Like I said earlier, everything about One Eleven was just so easy.  All you need to do is relax. Can\u2019t wait to come back.",

              "text": "My friend and I booked accommodation on internet for nine nigths at One Eleven in July 8 - 17, 2014. We compared many accommodation options before we made decision and reservation and read the comments about them and finally we chose One Eleven because so many visitors has positive comments about it on internet and especially on TripAdvisor.\n\nThe service at One Eleven was excellent and we really loved the breakfast made privately for us every morning in the kitchen of our villa.  Every evening  the breakfast and juice options were introduced to us by our butler and we made our selection for the next morning. We had three breakfast options to be selected and one of option was always Indonesian breakfast and the other ones were international breakfasts. The selection changed daily, so you have many options to be selected during your stay. The breakfast was always fresh and very lush (main dish, bread, coffee, yoghurt, juice, marmalades, milk, cereal, fresh fruits, etc.), so we had no need for lunch at all!  I had my 50-year birthday during our stay and on my birthday morning breakfast team suprised me with the song and cake, that was really nice gesture and made my day!\n\nEvery day we had complimentary water, fresh fruits and some small cakes and sorbets for resfresments. As real coffee lovers (we are Finnish :)) we really appreciated complimentary Nespresso coffee maker and the selection of espressos and black coffees. In-room Wifi worked well.\n\nDuring our stay at One Eleven we had complimentary private car and driver to be used in Semiyak region. That was very handy and safe at those evenings when we had a dinner in restaurant outside the hotel neigbourhood and we did not like to walk in the dark evening along the narrow streets. One evening we had a dinner at Shiro Sushi restaurants situated at One Eleven, we can really recommend this restaurant for all sushi lovers.  All ingredients were fresh and sushis were perfectly  prepared and the interior of the restaurant is very stylish and as Scandinavians we loved the clean forms and lines of architecture. Even the prices at Shiro are quite high compared to standard Indonesian price level, the food was the worth of the price.\n\nThe personnel of the One Eleven was amazing and very helpful, they made all reservations for the dinners and trips to the countryside. If we had any question or needed transportation we just called \u201d0 \u201d with our telephone for butler service and they always dId their best to serve us. We even use \u201din room dinner\u201d service at this hotel, because it was not pricey and the food was delicious. \n\nWe really enjoyed our stay at One Eleven in apartment number six:  the privacy, the helpful and very friendly staff, the great pool villa with the garden, the pool is large enough to swim, villa is spacious, clean and modern, all equipments and furnitures are very high standard (only the sun deck by the pool in apartment six needs to be fixed, some of the wooden boards were broken). During our stay the surroudings were very peaceful and there were no noisy neigbours, so we had perfect holiday at One Eleven.  One Eleven is definetely worth of five stars or even more!  If one negative comment must be given, it was this: the hotel was so great that you just want to stay there and not want to go outside!  Terima kasih (many thanks)  to the staff and our butler Udin, we will definetely be back to this hotel when we next time visit Bali. Hope it will be soon!\n\nPak Mika and Pak Tapio",

Modern luxury  but with traditional and fabulous Balinese service.  Great location as well.  We are always a little nervous booking a new accommodation - will it really be as nice as it looks on the web?  111 did not disappoint!!!  We were sad to leave and will definitely stay here again.  Particularly when travelling as a couple, highly recommend this place. ",

Our expectations fell a little short and while the villas are ultra modern and include everything you could want, they certainly could do with a refresh. The party people checked in and we were enormously relieved to be leaving the very same night. While reportedly a couples only hotel there were clearly three people (or more?)  checked in and partying in Villa 6. Highlights: enormous villas; great pools; staff are enormously attentive; sensational drivers and local transfers. Lowlights: average in villa spa treatments and massages; major constructions happening directly across the road; no DVDs/movies available; sound travels extremely well across villas which is problematic when you land inconsiderate neighbours.",

I have also noted on your comments that more than two guests had checked in to a villa. As it is our policy that not more than two people are allowed to check-into one villa, we have seriously looked into this matter. Upon review, we believe the guests in question had some friends over to their villa for drinks, but they were not staying with us, however this does not take away the importance of your comments, as any inconvenience to our guests should be avoided.\r\n\r\nAt One Eleven, generally our guests are like yourselves, they are here for a time of quiet and peaceful relaxation whilst also being able to pop out to enjoy the highlights of Seminyak and Bali should they wish.  This is our own philosophy and what we wish to offer our guests and thus I have taken extra steps and will do our utmost to ensure that our guests enjoy their time with us. \r\n\r\nWith regards to the construction across the road,  we are assured that the work should be completed in the near future and are in regular contact with the contractor and owners of the project to minimize any inconvenience to our guests.\r\n\r\nIt is our wish to continuously look at ways to enhance further the One Eleven experience and after your receiving your review, we are now in the process of arranging a collection of DVD movies for the future use of our guests. I have also addressed your comments with our Spa Manager with regards to the spa treatments.\r\n\r\nI do sincerely thank you for your review as we take each review very seriously. It is my promise to our guests that we will continue to take every measure to ensure that a stay at One Eleven is as it should be. \r\n\r\nIn spite of the aforementioned, I do hope that overall you enjoyed your stay at One Eleven and Bali.\r\n\r\nWith very best regards\r\n\r\nDavid",

Like everyone else, we've been to Bali numerous times and stayed at various hotels/villas; none would come close to the luxury and service that is One Eleven. Perfectly designed villas (everything just makes sense), close proximity to Eat Street, large pools you can actually have a proper swim, excellent staffs, simple touches that enhances one's stay (thanks for birthday cake), the list just goes on and on!! Well done David and team, and `terima kasih' for your warm and generous hospitality.",

Right from the impeccable service at the airport, to the hospitality of staff at the check in, we were thoroughly spoiled. However, once we were shown to our villas, we were transported to a different world. The villas are of a very high standard, with all the comforts to make our stay feel like a home away from home. The attention to detail in planning the villa layout, choice of toiletries, fittings and spaciousness is clearly evident. The staff have been trained so well and have been so obliging of all our requests- driving us around the city, arranging dinner reservations and attending to all requests. Thank you David and team for such a lavish treat!",

The water seemed to be temperature regulated, and it was never too cold to jump in. The pool was also decently sized. The little perks in the villa showed alot of attention to detail, like the range of toiletries available as well as the Nespresso machine and even the provision of something like mosquito repellent. The breakfast was prepared in the villa itself and the spread was very decent also. The villa was also located near Seminyak street, so it's easily accessible to all the shopping and dining options. Too bad the massage room was not useable. The staff said the aircon was not working, and the room was way too hot because of the glass above it trapping heat. Nevertheless, we will definitely be back to 1 11 if we head back to Bali. This is not an experience to be missed!",

              "text": "My partner and I have just returned from 10 nights in Bali, all of which were spent at this perfectly located premium group of 9 modern villas. We were in villa 9, other people have said the walk is a little too far, we thought this ridiculous and enjoyed the privacy at the end, there is always the golf cart if the small walk proves too difficult. We had no issues with anything not working whilst we were there, the pictures are what you receive. Breakfast each day on call at our convenience was sensational, the large choices allowed us to have a different meal each day we were there. The selection of mini bar treats is extensive, as are the choices of toiletries in the bathroom. An abundance of towels, pillows and robes make the stay very comfortable.\nNothing was too much trouble, from booking a private car for the day to making a dinner reservation which always resulted in an excellent table upon arrival. The resorts vehicle was always available for local trips and we were offered pick up service from the many dinners we indulged in. The Japanese restaurant that is part of the complex was absolutely amazing, we eat a lot of Japanese food and this experience rates as probably the best ever. \nThe beautiful staff were very well presented, friendly and professional, our room was kept immaculate with no fear of lack of privacy or dishonesty. In fact the washing was returned with a receipt and some money worth about AU$10 and a note saying that it had been found. Whilst you can lock your bedroom within your villa we never did and never felt the need to.\nWe were asked to find something to point out that could be done better and we cannot. We are professionals who live in a somewhat luxurious house back in Australia, we could be described as difficult to please although I would say we have high expectations. We were completely impressed with the entire experience and cannot wait to return again soon. \nThank you for making our holiday.",

              "text": "If you are the type who likes massive resorts with hordes of people, the W would be the place for you. However, if you like privacy, service, and style, look no further. \nWe chose 111 for its size (only 9 villas), location (you are steps away from some of the best shops and restaurants in Seminyak), and for the villa design (the outdoor living room and high ceilings as well as the slick lines and minimalism appealed to us). What we didn't expect was the amazing service. The butler came with the driver to pick us up from our hotel in Ubud (he really didn't have to do that), and even though we changed our mind 5 tines about pick-up time, they accommodated us with perfect efficiency. Whenever we asked for the shuttle it was always available, and before we even arrived, they reached out to ask if they could make us any reservations or arrangements (which was perfect because many restaurants in Seminyak don't take email reservations). When we arrived they gave us all the reservation info and even called us one night to say \"it's getting late, we think you are running late to dinner, would u like a lift?\"\nWhen I told the butler I love mangosteen, he had some delivered and kept our fridge stocked with it. On the morning of our departure they offered take us breakfast in the villa as usual, even though it would have been at 4:00am. We felt bad and declined, so they made us breakfast to go. \nThe villa was stunning and very clean. The choice of toiletries was grand, and the pool impeccable. Yes, we also had the ac/hot water issue..ac in the bedroom had to be kept at 16c in order to get hot water from the shower. However, it didn't turn out to be such a big deal, since it was so hot outside that the AC was a welcome. And after we showered we just turned the temperature up. \nAll the technology was otherwise great, and ability to open the gate to the villa from the living room without having to run to the door was a nice touch. We were left little dessert surprises in the fridge each night, and the speaker was awesome..volume is loud enough for a party! We stayed by the pool one day and had a great time.\nThe staff also suggested a great driver to take us to Uluwatu and Jimbaran. He was cheap, nice, and took us to see places that were not on our list but we were enchanted with (blue point beach, etc).\nWe went to the W one night for a drink, and were ecstatic that we didn't stay there. Although beautiful, it is massive and you could be anywhere in the world and you wouldn't know it. Also, hoards of loud Russians (even though I am one) did not impress me one bit, and neither did the impersonal staff who shoved us in a cab were the driver charged us 150,000 rupiah to take us down the street to 111 ( what should have been a 25,000 ride). \nOverall, nothing from what we've seen in Seminyak beats 111, and their staff are made of gold. Worth every penny and we can't wait to return. ",

The pool was a little bit cold for my taste but it was perfect to chill when the sun was out. We had a problem with our air conditioner which was not working properly and since the water heating system was linked to the AC as I was told the water in the shower and bath was cold, however the problem was addressed as soon as we informed the receptionist.\n\nThe food is excellent. We had a promotional code which gave us a free private dinner, I was slightly disappointed as we were served on the same table we had our breakfast on every day while I had the impression from the pictures that we were going to have a different table, but the food was delicious. \n\nNeedless to say all the staff we had contact with were excellent and very keen to help. Special thanks to our butler Yankee.\n\nOverall a wonderful experience and I would highly recommend one eleven.",

The villas are as on the website, they're large, beautiful and comfortable, the pool is wonderful! The only trouble is that you can hear the other villas (even if each villa is very private). For the first 2 nights everything was really quiet and the last night we had one very loud neighbour ( the staff was really efficient in asking them to lower the volume but still...we had guests for dinner and we couldn't hear ourselves talk). \nBut truly One Eleven is all about the service. My fianc\u00e9 can be extremely picky and all his requests were answered promptly and efficiently with a smile. I invited some family members for dinner and wanted to cook myself and everyone at 111 went the extra mile to help me. And to give you an idea of what kind of truly personal service you get at 111: each day they will bring cakes before turn down service. On the first day they served some balinese pudding cake and I told the butler that my favorite cake/sweets were Putu ( a typical javanese street food sweet). The next day, they brought putu to our villa! How amazing is that? They're really not easy to find in Bali! \nI really would like to thank everyone at 111 for their truly personal service. If there was 6 star rating for service on tripadvisor, that's what I would give 111!",

              "text": "Really nice place. We spent there only 2 nights but it was an excellent choice. To start a decoration is great, tasteful and discrete. Rooms are very comfortable, equipped in all that you may need. I liked the idea of Spa area in every villa so you don't need to go anyway. The same with breakfast that is made in front of you in your room. It's really well placed, you just go outside and you have all shops and restaurants you need. It's not far from seaside if your private pool isn't enough. What is also important for me limited number of villas helps to conserve an intimate atmosphere. To be just I need to say that me had minor problems with communication with the driver for example, but as i wrote really minor and It stays one of best hotels that I've ever been to! Sincerely, I recommend it!",

              "text": "All the positive reviews are correct, this is a great villa and the service is perfect. It\u2019s better than any of the photos and some the best service we have ever had in Bali. \n\nSo let me provide some tips on staying here.\n\nThe Villas are off the main road. About 7 min walk. You will end up right next to Ultimo restaurant, and all the rest of the cafe strip, so perfect spot for eating.\n\nThe beach is a long walk, probably 20 min, but the car service is great. Can get busy during check-in/checkout times around 12-2pm\n\nYou can take one of the side roads instead of heading to the main road and you will end up at Grocer n Grind after about an 8 min walk.\n\nThe road out front is not sealed, so a bit rough, but nothing to worry about. Workers are keeping it wet and smooth regularly.\n\nThere are 9 Villas, so No 1 is right near the reception and 9 is right at the end. They have golf buggies if you find walking from 9 to reception too hard. I personally probably would not pick Villa 1 as it seems a bit too close to the reception, so might be noisy, but not sure.\n\nIf I had to find some faults, then I would consider these to be minor and nit-picking.\nThe light switch for the bedroom lights it too far to reach while in bed, so unless you really stretch, you have to get out of bed to turn off the lights.\n\nI hear that some guests complain about the massage room gets too hot during the day. While we stayed there, the temp was cool, so our massage was perfect. We kept the doors open to let the breeze in. However, I can see that when it\u2019s hot, the room is poorly designed to keep cool. It\u2019s got a glass roof!! I understand that they are looking to fix this issue.\n\nI see some comments about the internet, but we found it not too bad. Don\u2019t expect to watch HD YouTube, but ok for surfing. Skype was not too bad either. It was occasionally flaky, but a quick call to reception and they reset the router and all good.\n\nOverall, this is a very nice villa complex with great service in a great location",

              "text": "We stayed at 1 11 as the first stop on our honeymoon in Bali in August. We got picked up at the airport by our butler after a very long and stressful journey from the uk and were instantly switched into holiday relaxation mode as we were escorted into the car and given drinks and cold flannels! From that point on the level of service we received at the resort was exceptional.\n\nThe villas themselves are stunning as you'll see from the photos (they look exactly like the brochure for a change!) and the location is good, a couple of minutes walk from the main stretch through seminyak with restaurants and shops but far enough away to escape the noise of the traffic and people. The resort is a real oasis of calm. It's a bit of a walk from the beach but you can get dropped off, seminyak beach isn't great though so we mostly hung around our villa for 3 days!\n\nWe had massages in our villa which were very good. Probably much much more expensive than if you were to have them outside the resort but it's a nice treat to have the treatment in your villa and go back to sunbathing afterwards!\n\nWe also ate in the Japanese restaurant attached to the hotel which served good sushimi and fresh sushi.\n\nAs with everywhere we've stayed in Bali the staff are wonderfully friendly and bend over backwards to accommodate you. We felt a bit embarrassed at first ringing them up every time we wanted anything and having the butlers rushing down to your villa but once you get used to being waited on its a great experience!\n\nWould definitely recommend this place to couples visiting seminyak.",

Wonderful stay for a few days - it was a few months ago - we were two couples in adjoining villas -- extremely well looked after - discreet but very effiicient staff and butler -- arranged anything we asked -- Wives said the massage service was excellent.. Time seemed to fly past too fast -- and we want to return. Can just balance it by saying that Shiro was a bit disappointing - food was fine, but lacked personality.",

I do hope that on your next visit, you will find it fully meets your expectations.\r\n\r\nThank you again for staying with us and I hope it will not be too long before we are able to welcome you back to One Eleven.\r\n\r\nWith very best regards\r\nDavid",

They know your name/wifes name and you genuinely feel they want your stay to be perfect. Our butler had previously worked on luxury yachts in Europe and knew exactly what he was doing. Any small issues the staff deal with quickly and efficiently. Great feeling of being welcome. The management have clearly been careful with recruiting and it makes a huge difference to your stay. \n\nTRANSPORT- car is available to take you to nearby locations. Makes a huge difference again. Drivers are polite, well groomed, friendly and know where they are going.If you have stayed at other villas in Bali you will know this is not always the case\n\nF&B- food is excellent. A few times we ordered cocktails and got some nice tapas to go with it. Fridge is well stocked with quality items not just rubbish from 7/11. Fridge is cold enough! (Rare)\n\nROOMS- very spacious and clean. Bathroom excellent with amazing ameneties like unique shower gels, sun cream, aloe, body creams. Great shower.\n\nOUTDOOR- very spacious and practical, living area great for hanging out reading the news, chilling out. Amazing private massage rooms and great massage service. Pool is beautiful and clean\n  \nLOCATION- short walk to Jl Oberoi and many shops/resto's nearby. One of the reasons we didn't try the Japanese resto on sight!\n\nThese villas have got it right. This is up there with the Club Villas at the Legian in my opinion as the best in Bali. If its within you're budget I doubt you will be disappointed. I would now hesitate to stay anywhere else because this place guarantees satisfaction, you just can't go wrong here. Thanks to the great staff and management. \n\n",

Honestly, absolutely everything about this place is fantastic and well worth paying for. We will DEFINITELY be back.\n\nThe villas are also super private as there are only 9. We didnt see anyone else and only heard a few splashes in next doors pool! Next time we will have to try out the restaurant on premise!\n\nDavid and team do a fantastic job to make sure everything is above and beyond your expectations and also helped me organise something special after my engagement surprise!!\n\nThe only bad thing about the villas is having to leave. I've stayed in many villas in Seminyak and 1 11 is head and shoulders above the rest. Cant wait to get back there.",

We could not imagine a better end.\nIt is a recent design hotel that consists of nine spacious villas with private pool and it is even better than the pictures on the website. \n\nThe living room has all amenities you require, the fridge is maxi size and has way too much candy, sweets, icecream and other goodies (there goes the weight).\n\nBedroom is really spacious and the bed is really good, perfect nightsleep.\n\nBathroom, much better than in the picture, all kind of soaps & more, lot's of towels etc... bath & shower.\n\nReally everything you could wish for was present: luxury, tranquility, top service, nice breakfast that they personally prepare every morning for you and a massage in your own pavilion. The staff was incredibly friendly, warm and helpful. Our compliments to Yenky our personal buttler for his excellent service!\n\nA welcome drink and a foot scrub with massage on arrival and free transportation we found a very nice touch.\n\nThe only minor thing to this has nothing to do with One Eleven, it's the location, it's not bad but this place on some sandy white beach with blue water (Gili Meno? Lombok?) and we would never leave it!\n\nOur thanks to everyone to provide us with a memorable stay. Leaving this place hurts.\n\nKristoff & Jasja",

              "text": "1) The Villa\n\nEverything looks exactly the same as it appears in the photos! Not like most photos out there which are heavily photo-shopped. Style is a very personal thing. If you are a modern minimalist, this is definitely the place for you. I chose this because this suits my boyfriend and my style completely and it definitely met our expectation. \n- Cool pool with a good depth\n- Large bathtub that can fit two\n- Clean and well maintained. But be prepared to face some mosquitoes and lizards, which are inevitable in tropics. \n- As the environment is really tranquil, you might feel awkward if you get too loud. \n\n2) The Service\n\nI cannot emphasize how amazed we were by all the service staff. \n- Even before I confirmed my reservation via email, the reservation staff has been extremely helpful with all my questions and requests! Be it One Eleven related or not!\n- Reception + Housekeeping + Butlers who served us our meals: \nEveryone of them is amazingly thoughtful and helpful! \ne.g: Smple gesture of removing my robe from the chair while I pose to take photo (knowing that the robe will spoil the picture).// Informing the driver of our local tour (doesn't belong to One Eleven) about my food allergies. // Sending a driver to pick us up when we got lost somewhere near the villa etc etc etc\n\n3) The Value\n\nThe price at first glance is rather steep. But given the quality of the \"hardware\", service, food and spa, it's definitely worth right down to the cent.",

There is no better place imaginable. All the privacy, service, BEAUTIFULLY designed surroundings, amenities, food, 'maxibar' and facilities. I cannot recommend this highly enough. Expensive, but worth it for those memorable special occasions where you want alone time and nothing to worry about or hassle you. \nThe best hotel/villa I've ever stayed in - design beyond imagination. They have thought of every detail. \nThank you x ",

The amount of space we had was truly a luxury!  \n\nTheir Japanese Sushi Bar, Shiro, is a beautiful cozy space though the airconditioning is on the weaker side.  Their selection of sakes is respectable for Bali (but with all alcohol on the island - overly-priced).  Took the omakase shiro set, which is very substantial but the plating and presentation could be improved.  The fish were very fresh but they did kill the scallop course by over-cooking.\n\nThe staff is competent, friendly and speak good English.  And GM, David, had gone out of his way to make our stay extra special!  'Thank you, David!  Hope you'll consider adopting some of the suggestions I've made to you!' \n\nOne of the best stays I've had in Bali!  Nuff said, just check out the photos!",

We were blown away by the size, clean and sophisticated architectural design, attention to detail, and serenity of the place.... It was overwhelmingly fantastic! The staff are so thoughtful and with only a few villas you are treated with so much care you feel like royalty. the small things are around every corner - welcome foot bath, chilled face towels, honeymoon cakes, exotic fruits, chefs into your room to cook breakfast... The list can go on. I cannot wait to go back again one day. ",

              "text": "I was lost for words when we reach our room..it was so huge with modern design, what can I say when all have been said by other people. You have to experience it yourself. Look no further if you are coming to Bali. You must stay in One Eleven even if is just for 1 night. It's worth every penny(FYI I stay for 3 night). As a Muslim I am very conscious about food as majority of the food is not Halal in Bali, but I was assured from the staff that all the meat are Halal and it made a great stay for me.On the first day I inform the staff that the room was not cold enough, may be the room was huge and the air con could not make it cold. the next day they brought me a standing fan, what a great service and we had a great night sleep.\nThe only downside to me is the Spa. You could not have your Spa in the morning or midday as it is to hot in the spa room due to the glass roof, I understand that they want natural light in, but if the room is to hot it not wort it, maybe they should change it to a normal roof so that people can have the spa anytime of the day not just in the evening or night.\nThe other problem i had with the spa is the masseuse..we had a complimentry 2 hr massage, the person who massage me did a good jod for the first 45min and when she thinks that i am sleeping she just keep touching my foot and when I make her known that I am not sleeping she will do a proper massage, but she still did the same thing again when she think i am sleeping I just gave up and let her be.That is the only downside for me but for the rest of the stay is was great from the front office staff to the service staff every one was top of their service. O ya I forgot to mention that they provided a free pick for me from another hotel and after that they even send me to my next destination as I was hopping around Bali...a few days here a few days there...thank you one eleven for the great service.\n\nPS:- I book direct to one eleven and they gave a great price + 2hrs free massage for 2 + dinner or lunch for 2. It's better to book direct then going thru any agency.",

              "text": "I had looked at enough pictures of the resort before I made my decision so I knew what to anticipate but still by the time I made my step into my very own villa I still had that big \"WOW!\" moment. The private pool long enough for lap swimming stands out in the competition. Fantastic beddings. The services and staff were impeccable, 3 sent to prepare breakfast in-villa and it was wonderful. The mosquitoes were a bit annoying, the repellent incense and spray helped a little but keeping the bedroom door closed at all times will ensure a nice sleep. Water temperature not consistent and may need a larger hot water tank. The street right outside in rather poor conditions with potholes and all that, some maintenance works necessary but not sure if it's within control of the resort. It's located at a distance from the main street and I don't recall seeing any signs pointing into the narrow lane leading to the resort. The local driver who came to pick me up for my next destination agreed this place should not be easy to find at any first attempt\n\nToo short a stay and I didn't have a chance to sample the Jap restaurant Shiro. A thoroughly enjoyable experience at 1 11, highly recommended.",

More so that you enjoyed your stay with us and the One Eleven service.\r\n\r\nThank you also for your feedback.  I can advise that we do fog the premises twice a week to get rid of those pesky mosquitos and on the whole, this is quite sucessful but on occasion, they do get through which is why we provide the coils every evening.\r\n\r\nWe have checked the wate heater at your villa to ensure that the water is more consistent in future and hope that on your next visit, this will not be a problem.\r\n\r\nOn the quality of the street outside, we are advised by the local municipality that the roads are to be pathed within the next few months and we continue to follow up on this.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your feedback and hope to see you again at One Eleven soon.\r\nBest regards\r\nDavid",

              "text": "One Eleven is really a little slice of heaven in the middle of Seminyak. On arrival, I was escorted straight to my villa and check-in was processed in the sitting area. A welcome drink was presented and I was also treated to a foot bath. \n\nThe villa is quite big, with a separate spa pavilion right next to the rather big swimming pool. The spa pavilion does get very warm in the day though and the air conditioning in it is not up to the task of keeping the room cool. I ended up doing my massage with the windows open. The pool is great for doing a quick lap and the water didn't give off a strong chlorine smell that you'd get with most other swimming pools. In fact, I almost believed that it was a fresh water pool.  \n\nThe sitting area is open air and can get rather warm but the fan does a decent job of keeping it cool enough. The kitchen is a welcome addition, as it allowed me to cook up a light supper. The bedroom area has a very spacious wardrobe and comes with a very modern entertainment system, hugh Sony LED TV and a Blu-ray player to boot. I was quite impressed by that as not many hotels, even the most high end ones, provide Blu-ray players in the rooms. The air conditioning was cooling enough but would have been better if it was stronger. The wi-fi, although complimentary, was rather weak and at times very difficult to get a connection to even load a webpage. One also has to be careful with the reading lights as they hang rather low from the ceiling and can be a hazard to taller people when getting on/off the bed. The master light switch is also a bit of a stretch when lying in bed. \n\nThe bathroom is very spacious and comes with his/her toiletries, including a full range of separate soaps/shampoos catering to both male and female users. The tub is pretty big although it isn't the most comfortable to rest in, as there is headrest. The rain shower was adequate to the task although it might have been better to have a conventional shower head installed as well. Water pressure was a tad weak and the temperature inconsistent at times. Some of the towels did have little stains on them but overall it was negligible. \n\nThe best thing about One Eleven is the service. The staff never failed to greet me by name and were always very accommodating with my little requests. There is a shuttle service around Seminyak available to the hotel guests and it was easily available throughout the day. The daily breakfast prepared in my villa was quite a treat. I was recommended a lovely Italian restaurant called Ultimo, just a 5-10 walk from One Eleven, and it proved to be a great place for dinner. The prices were very reasonable and the food of good quality. The housekeeping team changed the towels each time after I left the property and that really made me feel that the management wanted guests to feel like their every need was being cared for, one can never have too many bath towels, considering Bali's weather.\n\nOverall I'd happily recommend One Eleven to anyone visiting Bali and I do hope that many other people will get the chance to experience their charms.",

The villa is breathtaking with a lot of personal space, the pool is amazing and the outdoor living area enhances the overall experience. The staff are also very friendly and attentive. It's also easy walking distance to the main Seminyak street. \n\nThe only minor points of criticism would be the inconsistent Wifi (however the support was excellent when we called) and the 4 day breakfast rotation which was slightly repetitive. \n\nExcellent escape from life to relax and recharge. We loved it!",

Everything you can wish for is available in the kitchen, and then there is the relaxing massage in your own massage area.\nThe location is good: quiet, but the lively area is not far. The immediate surrounding area does not really look nice, but it is OK. You can walk to the Kudeta beach bar.\nThe prepared food is very very good: chef cooks breakfast in your own villa, and dinner too if you want. The bathroom is very nice and the bath is georgeous.\nThe airco worked very well, actions were also taken to deter mosquitos, only minor issue was that the bathroom fan was in an open hole so mosquitos could enter (but they fixed this temporary on my request).\nIf you want to relax in style, this place has everything and more. Highly recommended. I want to go back today!\nI had to leave one day early and they paid back this one day even without me asking. You do not find this kind of honesty a lot anymore.",

One Eleven consists of 9 villas, all of which are very well designed and stylish, yet also functional. The small size of the resort is the reason for a very \"family like\" athmosphere - most staff would know the guests by their names, remember preferences etc. Since it is located on a land parcel away from the beach, there is no view from the beautiful villa, only the pool, garden and massage gazebo. On the other hand you get a real maximum of privacy, quiet and peace. There is a small Sushi restaurant on site, which is absolutely outstanding. Other than that there is no bar or seating area. This again is compensated by fabulous chefs who come to the villa to prepare breakfast live and fresh and to the individual taste. The room service food is also excellent and excellent restaurants are literally around the corner. The only real drawback is the poor wifi service which I have reported to the manager who promptly promised to get this fixed with a more powerful system asap.",

              "text": "After reading many of the positive reviews (as they should be!), there's certainly not a whole lot to add other than sharing the personal experience my wife and I enjoyed during our stay at One Eleven.\n\nAfter a shaky start to our annual vacation at a sister resort, we were fortunate enough to be whisked away to One Eleven. First off, I have to congratulate the manager of both resorts, David Beevers (I know you'll be reading this), for going out of his way to make our stay as memorable as possible and making us negate the start of our trip.\n\nOne cannot help but go \"Wow...\" when walking into the villa. If you think you have an expectation of how it's going to be by looking at the photos, you will be blown away in reality. The decor and architecture is modern and beautiful. The colours used throughout the villa is vibrant and the whole feel of the place simply puts one into \"relaxation mode\". The pool is huge and absolutely divine. The bedroom is spacious with a tonne of cupboard space and an ultra comfortable bed. The bathroom doesn't leave much behind and it has one of the best showers I've ever experienced in my life!\n\nBreakfast gets prepared in your villa by a little army of staff every morning - the food and present menu choices are great. Everything else throughout the day is only a phone call away and usually gets done within minutes. On that note: the staff at One Eleven is exceptional. It's not your average Joe Bloe staff generally found in some Bali resorts - of the conversations we enjoyed with some of the staff members revealed their previous experience in the hospitality industry in parts such as Europe and the US. And they leave no stone unturned. My wife felt sick during our first couple of nights (head cold), and upon asking the staff for directions to the nearest pharmacy, our butler asked what exactly it is we were after. After providing the detail on some meds, he returned half an hour later with the tablets - totally unexpected!\n\nAnother major plus mentioned here was access to a hotel driver. Yes, friendly gentlemen are available to drive you around locally when needed. This is a massive perk, and I'd like to thank David and his drivers for providing this service to their guests.\n\nThe whole experience is personalised, and it's the small things that really captivated us. They noticed that stack of novels next to the bed; the next day we found little bookmarks inserted where we last left off! The staff also noticed that we drink a lot of water, and so every night while preparing our room, bottled water and a glass would be placed next to the bed. Things get done without having to ask. You don't get to experience that in many places these days.\n\nWe're a very private couple, and we go to Bali to relax, recharge, and enjoy some peace and quiet. That's exactly what you can expect at One Eleven. The resort is superbly private and extremely quiet - it's as if the wider audience enjoying their stay at the resort have the same frame of mind as us! If that is the sort of break you're looking for as a couple, I cannot recommend this resort highly enough.\n\nThis place is a hidden gem and this experience has been one of our best getaways yet. The best we've had in Bali. Definitely expect us again next year One Eleven!",

              "text": "My wife and I spent 4 nights here during our first trip to Bali. We were also celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary. When we arrived, we were greeted by a small army of staff, including the manager I believe, and then whisked to our villa in a golf buggy. When we stepped in, we went \"WOW\". The villa itself is stunning, and we were even more awed when we stepped into the room to discover the bed decorated with flower petals spelling out \"I love you\" along with a heart shaped cake waiting for us. We were awed. We also had a cold drink waiting for us, and a foot scrub as well! Nice!\n\nThe villa has good amenities such as a Yamaha ISX800, Sony Bravia, Eubiq power strips, Krups coffee machine, and the list goes on. Everything is very new and clean - well it is just about 5 months old. The pool is lovely and one can pretty much do a proper lap in it, unlike other villas I have encountered with smaller pools. There is a spa gazebo within the villa grounds, so you don't need to wander off far at all to enjoy a massage. \n\nWe looked forward to breakfast prepared in the villa every morning, with a menu presented the night before for us to make our selection. During the day, we received ice lollies - pretty much frozen fruit juice, a welcome treat when it's so hot and humid. Do check out the sushi bar Shiro as well, tucked away in a corner with intricate woodwork and sashimi that was fresh and well portioned. I enjoyed the unagi kabayaki, and also found the chawanmushi delightful with a little orange peel in it. Chef Shiro-san saw us out after our dinner as well and presented his card to us. Excellent food and service. Do try.\n\nService was always just a call away and a buggy will appear to whisk you away, along with a driver that is available to drop you off anywhere within Seminyak and fetch you back as well. \n\nSo what's there not to like? We had mozzies bothering us each night, despite weekly fogging and repellents in the room. We felt our room wasn't cold enough and despite our feedback, we don't think much was done as it pretty much felt the same. We also felt that the dining area was too warm and on one hot night we were perspiring as we dined. \n\nBut there isn't too much to complain about. One Eleven is an awesome choice amongst the many many options in Bali, especially more so now with the soft launch discount.",

              "text": "At first I was hesitant about staying in this villa since there were not many reviews.  But after corresponding with the hotel staff via email, and getting very prompt responses, my fears were laid to resort.  \nOnce I arrived at the resort, I was BLOWN away!. It does look exactly like the pictures on the website.  My partner and I loved our stay at One Eleven.  The service was top notch!  We had a driver that would take us around seminyak free of charge at anytime.  They also surprised my partner with a birthday cake for his 40th birthday!  We would come back to the villa every evening with little treats left for us. And they were yummy!  Our breakfast was cooked made to order in our villa for us every morning.  The staff was always cordial and friendly, offering to help me book dinner reservations and day trips!  You really don't have to lift a finger once your there.  \nThe architecture of this villa is absolutely stunning.  I loved modern design and I want my home to look exactly like this villa.  The temperature of the pool was always perfect, whether swimming day or night.  The bedroom had adequate A/C and it was quiet also.  Bathroom was gorgeous, although a double sink would be nice.  We also got a free spa treatment in our own private spa gazebo.  And it was AMAZING!  The masseurs definitely knew what they were doing.\nIn the end, I would recommend this resort without hesitation.  It is truly an oasis within busy Seminyak.",

The place is very new, and surprisingly, we didn't see a single mosquito or fly (given that this is Bali after all) - a huge bonus point indeed.\n\nBrownie points for the impeccable service as well - we had a complimentary foot scrub at our own spa pavillion upon arrival, and the breakfast cooked in house was just yummy... and nicely arranged so that you feel that you are in your own private restaurant! \n\nWould definitely want to visit this place again - definitely ranks as one of the top villas I have stayed in - it was a great overall experience for me.",

From the moment you are picked up from the airport and throughout  our stay, the staff could not have been more helpful or friendly. The special treats brought to us daily added such a special touch to this magnificent property. The attention to details with everything in the villa was exceptional. The coffee machine, the bed, the men's and women's toiletries, the fully stocked fridge... I could go on!\nTruly a magnificent experience and we were genuinely sad to leave. \nWe had stayed in another villa in Seminyak in Feb 2012 which we would not return to but One Eleven would definitely be on our 'revisit' list. \nDo yourself a favour and experience this wonderful property.",

It felt as though I was in my own home! Superb breakfast was cooked in the villa and cocktails were served to me at 5pm whilst we were in our private pool!!\nThe chef and his team (all talented Indonesians) prepared outstanding meals and One Eleven will certainly earn a reputation for superb cuisine. \nSpacious accommodation, great facilities and excellent location contributed to a very enjoyable stay.

Love the design! for the price Rp 3.3 mil tax incld equal to us$350/ night tax incld (with airport transfer and breakfast included) this is the best bargain I've ever got. The staff are so friendly and helpful (24 hr). They cooked your breakfast in your open air private kitchen! Amazing! The spa is also inside of the villa and its huge! The pool itself is not just a small pool it is big for a private villa. The property only got 9 villas and all the same design. So booked your stay at least a month before since this property will definitely get busy! Note: There is no family allowed !",

What struck us most upon entering the hotel is the peace, calm and neatness of the place, considering you have just stepped in from the dusty hustle and bustle of Seminyak main streets. The staff are amazingly friendly and helpful and whatever you need is literally just a press of a bell away.  The butler service is cool. There's nothing like getting up in the morning and putting your make up on while someone else is quietly working away and getting all this lovely food ready for you, right where you are sitting!  I think the place had not been open very long yet and unfortunately we just didn't have the time to samply the restaurant or spa services.  Although the foot massages upon arrival were a  standard offering and a very nice touch.",

Quite peaceful and luxurious. Don't know where to start. First time in Seminyak area, now Im confident that is the place to be. Shops and great restaurant. Also clubs  If you cant go out  no worries they have at the resort butler service. Any drink you like. :) and fast to\nLove the breakfast by the pool. Didn't have to dress up and go somewhere. Just remember to book it in night before. We stayed for couple of nights and the breakfast was superb on each day. fantastic coffee.\nThe design of this place is just as we like it. Simple, top of the line and functional.  can tell that someone who designed it, understand what holiday escape needs. You can trust there picture shots of the resort. That is what you you will get. No photo shop like others resort. You pick by pictures and then you end up in ugly old resort. Not this place. Definitely the place we book next year. Love it.

A right mix of minimalism and Asian/Japanese feel I would say. But what is really outstanding and sticks to my mind is the vertical garden - a must see piece of work. A whole wall (xxxx meters long) dedicated to greenery. As I walked down from the villa to the lobby, never seem to stop amazing me.\nArchitecture is not all I will remember about One Eleven. Its the service and people who create the place. It is in its opening stage now, some of the things yet \"to be polished\", but overall I think its fantastic. Spa room treatments, poolside cocktails, freebies like mosquito repellant every night and a lot of attention from the staff shows that management do really care about their guests. On my next trip to Bali, I will not look for any other place than One Eleven. Just afraid the price might go really up once they passed the opening stage operation....",

It's been open for a few days only before our arrival. Our original booking was at a different hotel, from which we checked out after the second night after a bad experience. One Eleven is truly boutique property with very limited villas, if not mistaken 11 villas only. It might be small in total number of units, but big inside. The space is just unbelievable. Swimming pool is big enough that you can really swim in it. TV in bedroom, another TV in the living room, private spa pavilion, bathroom with bathtub and shower, outdoor shower, over sized sofa and dining table for a party of 6 are almost over the top! This is a 1-bedroom villa I am talking about. Service itself was excellent, staff would do anything at anytime to make sure you get what you asked for. I also haven't had spa treatments in my own pavilion before. It was just top-notch. And the best part is, there is no name to this hotel from outside!!! You won't see any big signage, only a little logo which doesn't say much but step inside and wow!",

              "text": "It was only by chance that we came to know of One Eleven. We were staying at another hotel and had to pass this amazing looking building with wood panels on our way to the restaurants and shops along Eat Street. It was nothing like the buildings in Bali and with a nondescript sign, curiosity got hold of us and we walked in to ask. We were given a tour of the villa and were bowled over with what we saw that we jumped ship :)\n\nFirst thing that amazed us was the vertical garden along the walkway from the lobby to villa. Walking along that garden everyday on our way in/out was somewhat very calming. And when we stepped into our villa, we immediately fell in love with the spaciousness and style. Such clean lines.\n\nI personally like to laze around after a massage and maybe snooze a little more. Having our own spa pavilion allowed me to do so. (At most of the spa places I have been to, the therapists would knock at the door to rush you out almost immediately after treatment so they can take another guest!). You have to try the Four Hands Massage - a pair of hands rubbing away all the tight knots, now imagine 2 pair of hands working on you - HEAVEN!\n\nWhat they didn't advertise is the Daily Surprise that they dole out. During our stay, we found home made ice lollies in the freezer. After a hot and sunny day at the beach, this was a nice gesture. On another day, they served us strawberries dipped in chocolate. Very sexy, you know what I mean.\n\nWe don't need to go into the obvious details (whatever is in their ads, it's true!). For us, it's the little things that count. And these little things will make us come back to One Eleven again.",

Die Ausstattung ist perfekt.\n\nDer Pool ist genial - bei der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe kann manch Schulschwimmbad nicht mithalten;-). Nicht nur die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe ist super, auch die Abtrennung in Schwimmbereich und Chillbereich.\n\nAuch der Service l\u00e4sst keine W\u00fcnsche offen. Das Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck bestellt man am Abend mit Angabe der Uhrzeit vor und es wird dann live in der villaeigenen K\u00fcche zubereitet. Es hat immer alles genial geschmeckt !Auch kleine \u00c4nderungen waren immer problemlos m\u00f6glich.\nEbenso lie\u00df auch die Maxibar keine W\u00fcnsche offen - es war wirklich alles an Getr\u00e4nken und Knabbereien da, was einem nur in den Kopf kommt.\nDas Personal war \u00e4u\u00dferst freundlich und hat uns jeden Wunsch erf\u00fcllt.\n\nEs g\u00e4be noch sooo viel tolles zu berichten, aber das w\u00fcrde den Rahmen sprengen.\nEinfach hinfahren und genie\u00dfen!\n\n",

Het zwembad is zalig groot en in de tuin is er altijd een plekje in de zon of schaduw te vinden. \n\nBediening fantastisch: ontbijt werd in onze keuken klaargemaakt, hadden een eigen butler. \n\nAls je daar verblijft dan heb je niet de behoefte om buiten te gaan dus hebben wij 22u genoten van ons eigen stukje paradijs.
