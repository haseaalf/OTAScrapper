Selama menginap dg periode yg cukup panjang dari awal cek in sampai cek out sangat memuaskan dan membuat kami betah. \nSeluruh staf sangat membantu dan ramah, terutama ibu Ningsih selaku FOM yg selalu mengakomodasi segala permintaan selama menginap, ibu Linda, Reception, pak Junaidi beserta staf lainnya yg tidak dapat kami sebutkan satu per satu. \nTerima kasih secara khusus dari kami untuk pak Junaidi yg memberikan kami rasa aman dan nyaman saat 1 malam dimana ada tamu pasangan yg bertengkar sepanjang malam dan dengan sabarnya pak Junaidi menerima keluhan kami dan mengatasi tamu tersebut. \nSingkat kata, The Capital Hotel akan menjadi rumah ke2 untuk kami kembali lagi dan doa serta harapan kami agar The Capital Hotel segera ramai kembali oleh wisatawan dan terus mempertahankan servisnya yg luar biasa. \n\nTerima kasih The Capital Hotel",

Walking distance to major places tourist will go to seminyak.\n\nI had a fried rice for my breakfast and i was surprised at how good it was ( at least for hotrl breakfast menu standard)\n\nMost of the facilities are still under construction but they have pool and spa ready. \n\nWill definitely stay here on my next trip!\n",

Beautiful wood and stone finishes, very quiet and pleasant balcony and light.\n\nThe location is ideal: one side of the road leads to the main clubs, massages, markets and shopping of Petitenget. The other side leads to the main roads to Ubud and other places around Bali.\n\nThe staff was very responsive and always listening. I will come back to Bali and use this hotel again.",

After escaping a nightmare hotel I (literally) ran across this gem. No reservation, no idea what to expect and I felt as if I was being welcomed home. They gave me a full tour hotel of the sleeping quarters and an extended tour of the property and facilities to ease my nerves from any possible false advertising (which is what I encountered at the previous \"hotel nightmare\"). Check in was easy and although the rooms and beds were brand new they allowed us a meal in Gin Sushi (great food,staff and devoted owners BTW) while they made sure the room was contruction-dust free and in tip top shape. They went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable, hydrated, fed, and relaxed by gifting us a free 1 hour massage which was the best massage I have gotten in Bali. I even got a bonus stretch at the end and she cracked every bone in my body. I boarded my flight back to NYC feeling lighter than a feather. Thank you to all the staff At Capital and the management team for making my stay exceptional. This Is definitely my go to hotel in Bali for both business or leisure. Cant wait to be back in a couple of months.",

The beds were comfy, the sheets were soft, and I loved how big the bathrooms are! I also loved that they had a balcony on my room and the Wi-Fi was very fast too\nThe only downside was they were renovating the restaurants in the hotel were closed. The pool upstairs was really nice and I liked the space around it so I could relax there all day. Location wise, was perfect for me, there is so much in that area and every thing else is 5-10 minutes away by a scooter.\nDefinitely going to be staying here again",

They ended up complimentary upgrading - ningsin and her colleague in particular were very helpful.\nThe rooms are spacious and the bed is super comfortable.

So as a solo traveller you feel spoiled. But with no doubt the the big plus is the the staff that reacts to any issue or demand. Shout out to the Frontoffice  who helped a solo traveller immensely and to housekeeper Agus  for taking care of my space and belonging while travelling and  island hopping.  Will definitely return next winter to  Capital.      Yanard.",

By a stroke of good luck we were upgraded and got a very nice LARGER Suite room with large bathtub, King bed & kids bed. \nAn amazing Rooftop swimming pool and ground floor pool + Gym. The restaurant was closed however indoor spa is available, business centre for wifi , and cocktails can be ordered during happy hours. \nSuperb location just 10 steps walk from Pepito Supermarket and nice bakeries, great Spas and just 10-15 walk from PetiTenget beach. \nI must mention Ms Dinda Front Office Manager for hospitality and Mr Tohfa for housekeeping who were very prompt and helpful. \nAmazing place \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

I was upgraded during check-in, and my room was very spacious and the bed was so comfy. I did spend a lot of time in my room, so the spaciousness and the comforts was very welcome. I loved that there is an in-house spa too, and I got one of the best messages I've ever had, with Diyanna the therapist. The duty manager Ningsih went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable in my room and even accommodated my request to change rooms after my first night and showed me rooms to see which I would like best. She would always greets me with a smile when she saw me, and asked how is everything and if I needed anything. Every staff member I've come across was very helpful and courteous and have offered to deliver my GrabFood deliveries to my room (when it got dropped off at reception), despite it being ordered from an external platform/ restaurant. I ended up extending my stay multiple times at the hotel and have been here for almost a month. I would definitely be staying here again.",

              "text": "I reviewed my experience on Agoda (from where I made the booking) and decided to also share it here to warn potential visitors.\n\nWhen we arrived for check in, the counter looked understaffed and we were told the room was still not ready by stated check-in time which was 2/ 3 pm  (the pillow covers were not cleaned and delivered, and towels were missing). Asked for a hand towel (because there was literally only one bath towel and one floor towel to share between my partner and I in the whole room) and they said they do not offer unless we specifically requested for one. Wifi was horrifically bad while the signal was also terrible (we used a company that was most well-covered in Bali already). I booked the business centre for working to receive better wifi, but ended up having a near-electric shock with a blown fuse accident while trying to plug in my computer charger into their electricity socket. The staff later explained it might've happened with the electricity shortage around the area, but never apologised nor followed up. \n\nIf you decide to do laundry there, they would count by item while you have to fill in a very complicated and incomprehensive form, which would end up costing a lot more than your regular laundry stop. I would recommend finding a laundry store nearby (and ask them to do your wash in colder water/ separating darks from whites).\n\nThe website showed a sushi restaurant that \"has been in renovation\" since 2020, and it's now the end of 2022 but there are no site of construction or intention to build it. Truly curious if the restaurant was built for show to earn the 4-star title. There was no in-house room service kitchen either, they had to order from a restaurant/ bar nearby. \n\nThat said, location is very convenient with walking distance to supermarket, bars, restaurants, the pharmacy. Room is also quite spacious for the price. Honestly, I would be more convinced and barred from disappointment if they had marked themselves as a 3-star hotel.",

Huge room & bed, bathroom & tub - more cabinet space than I have ever seen. Had a nice balcony with seating. Everything was very clean, the sofa & chair looked as if never been sat on. Corner Bakery directly across the street for coffee & pastries so convenient. Pepito's right next door. I will definitely come to stay here next time in Seminyak!",

We have attached our chronology report.  \n\nIt is a really unfortunate situation and out of our control when you said that you didn't lock your safe deposit box in the room. The Hotel prepared the facility in the high level of safety for the guest comfort. \n\nPlease be informed that we are still open to help you to make a police report, as per our information and action from the beginning, but somehow you keep rejecting our solution with no reason. And if you continue to do the wrong thing in this situation, we are left with no choice then to make a report of this because we don't want to have any defamation to our Hotel because of your review. \n\nWe are attached as well to your first review which shows that you are very happy with our product and services but then decided to change. At this stage, we don't think it's fair for us because your review of other things becomes really vice versa with the real condition. \n\nOnce again we are always encouraging you to make the report as per fact and real situation and not make any accusations with no proof. \n\nThank you and have a good day, \n\nBest Regards,\n\nNingsih. \n\n",

The bed is large and comfy, the room is nicely bright, a fridge was available, A very nice overhead shower, and large bathroom size. Staffs are super friendly and helpful (they even brought in our suitcase while we were still away waiting for the check-in time). My only complain is that i only booked for one night when shouldve booked for all my stays in bali. One other conplain is the traffic near petitenget (not the hotel\u2019s fault though).\n\nThankyou, will definitely return to this hotel !",

Staff are wonderful and accommodating especially Ningsih the Manager.\nBeautiful hotel inside and outside around the hotel there are many good restaurants and bars around the hotel, and only less than 10 minute to the beach from the hotel. \nBest thing is I can enjoy sunset from my room. \nHighly recommend this hotel.",

              "text": "The hotel is located in a very busy street where popular bars and restaurants are located. Therefore, and because of the currently reduced room rates, there are a young audience and many Indonesian guests in the hotel.\n The young people don't necessarily care about the night's rest, the Indonesian guests often mix up the hotel room with their private home and don\u2019t care about loudness. \nWe spent 4 weeks in THE CAPITAL.  Overall for me it is more 3* than 4* level. \n\n + central location, 20 min walk to the beach\n + friendly staff\n + modern, well equipped rooms\n + good WiFi\n + cheap price\n + underground parking available\n\n - a lot of young, inexperienced staff (interns?)\n - Staff does not care enough about the night's rest. Every third night we had to complain to the Lobby or to the neighbors directly. Make sure you don\u2019t have a room where the rooms next door are equipped with 3 beds - it gets always very loud. \n - all Room doors slamming loudly\n - House keeping service for our room 217 was very low standard (a lot of dust under the bed, the glasses in the bathroom were extrem dirty, the soap dispenser were not clean, there was dirt around the faucet.) Looks like there was a very quick cleaning after Covid lockdown and there is no supervisor housekeeping \n - Small towels only on request\n - In the rooms you can hear everything through the wall",

Very very good location as the rooms with the furnitures are almost new, good GYM the only thing about this hotel in Room number 201 or 202 I really don\u2019t remember the exact room number, but in one of those rooms there is an English guy who sleeps at 10 pm and he doesn\u2019t like to be disturbed. Drinks milk before he sleeps in bali \n\nI really like that hotel.. ",

My review of this hotel expresses highest praise: Exceptionally great, professional and friendly service from beginning to end, exceptionally great housekeeping, room maintenance, and room service, well equipped room and hotel, nothing at all to point out as negative. (The staff has even been willing to help me receive the delivery of a parcel that had been directed to Ubud, by kindly arranging for one of the staff members to pick up the parcel en route via Ubud -- amazing!!). I extended my stay based on my previous experiences at this hotel, and I can only highly recommend it to any other travelers. I am extending now for the third and fourth times, and I think that this hotel, only having opened in 2019, deserves highest credit as one seeking to establish itself successfully among the competition in this business, not least now during difficult times of the pandemic. I wish the hotel a grand \"comeback\" once tourism reopens fully again in the hopefully not too distant future.",

But for their ala carte menu still need more improvement.\n\nThe staffs was also very helpful and nice, they get in touch with costumer through Whatsapp, and I have found this way, was more effective instead of using in-room phone.",

Even though they were still in their soft opening operations, the staff were very attentive to our needs and even though we arrived at midnight for our check in, the staff was able to assist us in an efficient manner. The rooms are big and cozy, with the bed also very comfortable. The management of the hotel also gave us a free slice of cake after we came back from our Ubud trip (we were honeymooners), which was a very nice little touch that we really appreciate. The Indonesian breakfast option was also very delicious! Another thing that we like, the hotel is just beside Pepito's Supermarket, wherein we bought some stuff and the yummy Balinese coffee as our souvenir. ",

Our hope to travel round the beautiful island of Bali. \n\nWe booked into the Captial hotel on our second \nnight. This was a very last minute booking but they were able to accommodate us and how happy we were that we chose this wonderful hotel. Our stay there felt like a home away from home and nothing was too much trouble. We had the most lovely stay - so much so... we decided to return and finish our trip there too. \n\nThe rooms were extremely clean and modern as were all the public spaces. I would recommend taking advantage of the spa treatments - they\u2019re very reasonable priced and of an excellent quality.  \n\nThe location is perfectly ideal, a short walk to a good range of restaurants, cash points / money changers and small supermarket shops and only a short taxi ride to some of the renowned beach clubs like Finn\u2019s or about 10 minutes into the town of Canggu - a must visit on any trip. \n\nThe hotel is suitable for anyone! There are a variety of conference rooms all of which are fully equipped for those needing to do business while away. These a lovely roof top pool which provides some great views (and right next to a bar too - which offers happy hour). \n\nThe staff here are super friendly at every point of contact, and they welcomed us back on our return with open arms.\n\nFrom the stay at the hotel itself, to food and drink prices and spa treatments, everything is excellent value for money. \n\nWe will defiantly be back. Thank you so much to all the staff - we really appreciate all your kindness throughout our stay. \n\nTo any potential guests... get booking!! This hotel will make your trip and is most certainly worth the visit!!!!",

My room was overlooking to the pool. I enjoyed to sit down there to see sun goes down. Their bathroom also nice and clean with rain and hand shower. They clean the room everyday and refill my cofee and tea. They provide complimentary big bottle of water. I love the size of the room, it is suit me and my partner.  I wish i can stay longer next time.",

The staff welcomed us with lots of smiles and a lovely green tea and were incredibly helpful. The room was spacious and pristine and the bed was one of the best we\u2019ve experienced in Bali. The location is very good for cafes like Coffee Cartel and Kynd. Thanks Capital Hotel, we will definitely be back!",

The comfort, Good Night Sleep, Cleanliness, Envigorating Shower and Fresh Breakfast. The hotel is easy to access to a selection of restaurants and shops. In a destination, we need to interact with locals and amazingly the promise of stay at Capital to experience the genuine warmth of truly Indonesian hospitality is well delivered. Please talk to Ningsih, she is so helpful as well as her frontline team. \nI am very comfortable with my own space as my own luxury, yet we need to experience the comfort of a selected destination, the cheers, the beauty, the noise, the culture and many more.\n\nI will come back to stay at Capital in the near future to experience another genuine warmth of truly Indonesian hospitality.",

              "text": "I stayed in The Capital Hotel for consecutive long weekends as a base for business.The hotel is going through a \"soft opening\" being 90% complete. The fifth floor is yet to be opened. The location of the hotel is great for people wanting to be in the Seminyak/Petitenget area with the surrounding bars, restaurants and beach clubs.It is subject to the usual traffic snarls but if you are happy to jump on the back of a motor bike everywhere from KuDeTa to Cafe Del Mar are within five minutes. The beach is a twenty minute walk going down Jalan Cendrawasih.\nThe rooms are not huge but have a comfortable king size bed, TV with HBO and Fox movie channels, sports and news, a good size bathroom and an empty bar fridge which is great considering there is a Pepito market next door selling everything that you would find in a usual hotel mini bar at a quarter of the price. My room was on the third floor with rooftop views towards the west. From the fourth floor you can glimpse the ocean so the fifth floor views will be great. I had the same room on both stays, so I cannot comment on the views from other sides of the hotel.\nThe hotel has a small gym next to the swimming pool which is extremely well equipped for its size. They are very receptive to feedback and are making minor changes that that will make it even better. \nAntoine's Restaurant serves great quality food and their choice of breakfasts are both great value for money and tasty. I had sashimi at Gin Sushi which was also excellent. The staff are extremely friendly and polite and nothing is too much for them. That actually describes all the staff at the hotel, from the security through the front desk to housekeeping\nThe Capital is not a hotel that is really suitable for families, just like Petitenget, unless you are using it as a base for exploring Bali and winding down at the end of the day.. If that is the case then it is hard to go past the value that it offers at the moment.\nI will certainly be staying there again.",

We were quite surprised at the hotel and how nice and new it was. The room was huge with a nice big bed, shower worked perfect and was nice and hot which is always a win in Bali. The fridge was so cold which was another win!\nA few points to be noted; there are not many beds by the pool, the walls seem to be very thin in the place so you can hear neighbours moving chairs, flushing toilets, outside noise etc. Pillows were not the comfiest. Room service menu wasn\u2019t provided in the room and once I asked for it the staff did bring it up however there\u2019s not much on there at all. There is a sushi restaurant connected to the front which was nice however not much on the menu. \nOverall the staff were lovely and friendly and made you feel very welcome, it\u2019s a good location in Seminyak and well priced for what it is.",

Or you could just walk to get to the beach and passing through small boutique, cafes or gelato spot \n\nPROS\n- Good service. All Staff were friendly, responsive and accomodating. \n- Food was tasty\n- Room is spacious\n\nCONS\n- The room floor was a bit humid when you switched off the air conditioner.\n\nUpon the conversation with the staff, the next improvement will be to put the AC on reception/ lobby area. \n\nFor hotel trialist like my family, we would like to come back and stayed there.\n\n",

The Hotel is still in soft opening state.\n\nOverall, I really enjoy my stay here and would recommend to anyone.",

Best hotel I've stayed in Petitenget, Seminyak.\nIt's a newly opened hotel, and some facilities are not fully opened yet, however, the staffs and hotel manager were nice enough to compensate for us, upgrading our room to suite, providing us with sim cards due to slow wifi and accommodating our needs accordingly. They also looked for us for a local driver to drive us to Ubud and drop our baggages to a new hotel. \n\nAmazing hospitality by the staffs! keep it up. \nwould surely be back. \n\nThank you :)",

The hotel is brand new and it was during a \u201cpre-opening\u201d phase. We stayed 12 nights in total. The rooms are fantastic and nicely styled. The staff are very friendly also. Location wise, this also great, we nice shops and restaurants in walking distance. It\u2019s about 5 min taxi ride from Main Street on Seminyak, but definitely a great spot to stay! Highly recommend!",

From the moment we checked in to when we checked out, we were made to feel so well looked after. \nA special thanks goes to Indri and Jaya for making my sister and I feel so loved and welcome. All staff were exceptional, but unfortunately we did not get all the names!\nThe hotel is modern, it has a clean, minimal and classic look, which we love.\nWe loved the breakfast smoothie bowls. Well presented and so delicious.\nThe hotel's location is great, close to all of the best restaurants and shops.\nWe will definitely recommend this hotel to all our family and friends and can't wait to come back. Stay here and you won't be disappointed!\nThank you Capital Hotel and Resort for giving us such wonderful service and memories. \ud83d\udc96",
