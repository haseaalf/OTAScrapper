120,i also love the breakfast!
121,they changed the menu daily and the indonesian dishes are authentic.
122,i don't normally like hotel breakfast because they rarely taste like anything (since hotels mostly try to match everyone's tastebud and end up tasting just average for everyone).

157,"the breakfast buffet was fantastic, the roof top pool and bar was also great the hotel was very clean and the staff very friendly."
158,"we stayed for five nights at artotel sanur and love our room (studio 55) - did stay at artotel thamrin jkt (studio 40) when we arrived from texas because want to be near sarinah thamrin, places where i used to live... and near my family home before our visit to other beautiful indonesia (yogya, solo, surabaya, banyuwangi, lovina), after many years not able to see our grandkids, also friends due to covid and other things."
159,"clean, comfortable room, feel like in our own bedroom... awesome breakfast, also our dinner at artotel restaurant, excellent indonesian menu, bravo to the chef  also to pak ketut the breakfast guy."

169,); not a place conducive to use.
170,"the rain shower was great, the toiletries basic (although in eco friendly wrappings)."
171,"the rooftop (5th floor) pool is a good size but with limited chairs or chaises lounges and has no shade (although the adjoining bar is a good place to sit, and is shaded)."
172,"the breakfast buffet was quite good with a lot of choices, especially indonesian."
173,the staff were very nice.
174,"so, in summary, an ok stay but not fabulous."
175,i had a very pleasant experience at artotel sanur bali!!
176,i love how the staff maintain the relationship with me during the guest by being thoughtful and super polite which made me very comfortable to communicate with them.
177,"also, the artsy room and it’s located near the beach and very convenient to go there by walking"
178,stayed 4 nights as we arrived i. bali.
179,great location superb food and facilities with the staff being the star if the show.
180,they are truly superb.
181,1 minor grumble is bar closes at 9.30 last orders and room info and reception team said 11pm.
182,pool bar not always open.
183,as above plus great location in the middle of sanur.
184,love the pool.
185,guest relations did something special for us also with a stay in one of the suites for our honeymoon.
186,highly recommend this place ... breakfast is the best in bali
187,i booked here after seeing instagram and facebook photos from the company during covid.
188,there are a number of key points that make artotel sanur an attractive option.
189,"pros: * the lobby and public areas are impressive, almost like being in an art gallery."
190,"* i stayed in the smallest room size, which was more than enough for 1 person."
191,there is a small balcony with a drying rack for swimwear or dive gear before going home.
192,* the back end rooms have a beautiful view of mt agung in the early morning before it's clouded over.
193,* the hotel is only 30 minutes from the airport on the bypass toll road.
194,"* the area is convenient to the beach and eateries, yet still quiet."
195,"* hotel team friendly and professional, clearly well trained in international hotel management standards."
196,an issue with my door lock sensor was repaired within 15 minutes.
197,* breakfast was at a great promo price (aud$1!).
198,there were numerous asian and western options available.
199,seating in the restaurant wasn't a problem as they've converted the outside facing wall into a long counter bar (no stools).
200,* drinking water refills available.
201,"cons: * the pool deck area is lovely, but there is no shade."
202,"* yes, drinking water refills available, but you have to ask."
203,why not just put refill stations on each floor and guests can self service?
204,* inconsistent eco-friendly messages.
205,glass bottle drinking water but small disposable toiletry bottles.
206,i hope those empty coffee capsules are being returned to nespresso for recycling.
207,stayed 3 nights in a studio (40) room.
208,large room with a very big bathroom.
209,very nice buffet breakfast.
210,located in south sanur with plenty of restaurant options around the hotel.
211,perfect for our 1st stay on our 3 week vacation.
212,"good wifi, lovely rooftop swimming pool   we could easily come back"
213,amazing experience at the artotel sanur hotel in bali.
214,i stayed around 10 nights with my mom.
215,we had a beautiful room with both a shower and tub and a balcony.
216,the staff went above and beyond to cater to our every need and request.
217,we also got invited to a vip event at the rooftop which was a fun perk.
218,the plunge pool is also excellent with views of sanur and the kites.
219,the food was excellent and breakfast is included.
220,the spa service is also very high end and super worth booking.
221,we were in touch with manik the front office manager and he did everything in his power to make out stay the best experience possible.
222,he arranged for our ground transportation and we are super happy with the trips that were planned.
223,the house staff was also super friendly and attentive.
224,they even helped me lug around my heavy scuba equipment downstairs.
225,the hotel is modern and elegant and centrally located near many restaurants  and the main shopping street with cool boutiques and shops ( all walking distance).
226,the vibe is super artsy and hip.
227,no stuffy hotel here!
228,the only downside was the wifi which was a bit slow for my needs (i’m a freelancer and rely  on fast internet).
229,the robes and flip flops in the room were also a cute perk.
230,will definitely stay at another artotel location in the future.
231,the staff are very friendly & accomodating.
232,"the place is rightly positioned, to the shops & sanur beach with expectacular sunrises."
233,"great rooms with artistic walls, a truly boutique hotel."
234,this hotel is a great find for the price.
235,"we reserved two rooms for two adults and two children for an extended weekend in bali, and the total price was quite affordable."
236,"on top of traditional asian breakfast options, the free breakfast also had great food options for our picky children (cereal, toast, eggs made to order, selection of juices)."
237,the coffee was delicious.
238,we are young parents and enjoy the artsy vibe of this hotel which was still pretty family friendly.
239,"the hotel was hosting a party on the pool deck one night of our stay, and the loud music stopped at 10 p.m. as promised (although it didn't both us anyway)."
240,the place is also very clean throughout.
241,"the nearby beach looked rough at first due to construction, but there are actually quite a few shops on the boardwalk once you get out of the immediate construction zone."
242,"we did not swim in the water here because it seemed mostly for boats, but we enjoyed walking near the water and dinners on the beach."
243,my only suggestion for this hotel would be to guarantee the availability of joining rooms for families.
244,finding affordable joined rooms at smaller hotels  in sanur is difficult and it would be an attractive feature for visiting families.
245,me and my daughters stayed in this beautiful hotel on our last day in bali and we really had a memorable stay at artotel sanur.
246,this place has a 5 stars service.
247,"the staff are very friendly and professional, their rooms are super comfortable, really love the interior, so stylish and unique!"
248,"breakfast was great so we decided to try their restaurant and stayed for dinner and that was great too, they have various options of indonesian and western food with very affordable price."
249,we definitely will be back to artotel sanur on our next vacation in bali.
250,"thank you so much gustu for being a great host and all team, you really made our stay so special."
251,i loved my 4 night stay at artotel.
252,"the room was comfy, great ac and facilities."

254,i stayed on my own to decompress after a few hectic months of work and it was exactly what i needed.
255,definitely staying again!

257,warming welcome by front desk team and i had amazing breakfast.
258,"don't forget to check the rooftop and chill a lit bit, and enjoy the sanur vibes."
259,will comeback soon.
260,my 2nd time staying here.
261,always had a fantastic time here.
262,"unfortunately, i can't explore more inside the hotel because it was a business trip (a short stay)."

267,"the staff was friendly, agile and so helpful."
268,"i went to the pool early in the morning, and the view was pretty."
269,"it was clean, both the pool and the bench."
270,the location is just about 5 minutes walk to sanur beach.
271,the room decoration and building are very aesthetically pleasing.
272,"too bad i can't stay long here :( oh, and the environment inside the room was tranquil and pleasant."
273,"some nights we can hear local music from the nearest temple (i guess), from the hotel lobby."
274,it was relaxing for me.
275,this is my second stay in artotel sanur.
276,"the main honest reason of my return is because i want to redeem my birthday voucher (50% off), but ofcourse i also like the place."
277,the staffs are really nice and helpful.
278,they also have decent restaurant & bar.
279,"overall, it’s been a really nice experience."
280,i’d love to comeback again next time.

282,"the room and the vibe was amazing,  artsy and cozy at the same time."
283,"the room was spacious and clean, with king size bed covered with sheet that smelled so good."
284,bathroom amenities were more than adequate for your need.
285,the breakfast was another one to be appreciated.
286,they served various menus (and they were delicious) and you can order latte rather than just black coffee  for free (yay!).
287,"the location was very near the sanur beach, about 5 minutes away on foot."
288,definitely wanna stay in this hotel again when i visit bali in the future.
289,had a wonderful experience stayed in their s55 room type.
290,it’s very big and very suitable too if you want spent time with family members.
291,"if you like photoshoot, in here there are lot of instagrammable spots especially at their stairs and ground floor."
292,it only takes 5 mnts walk to the beach and any cute cafes and restos

294,"beautiful infinity pool, amazing friendly service and the food is outstanding !"
