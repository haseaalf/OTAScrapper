              "text": "Seorang teman dan saya baru-baru ini menghabiskan 7 malam di apartemen Beach Melati dan kami sangat senang dengan kunjungan kami disana. Kami berada di apartemen 202 yang luas dengan balkon semi-privat yang besar yang menghadap ke kolam renang. Bagian Rumah tangga terus membuat kamar bersih cemerlang setiap hari dan itu bagus, dan apartemen kami memiliki sofa yang nyaman, kasur, kamar mandi bersih dan segala yang Anda butuhkan. Kami berada di sana selama periode tahun baru yang sibuk dan meskipun semua apartemen telah dipesan, kami tidak pernah merasa tempat ini penuh sesak ataupun berisik dan 9/10 kali Anda dapat menggunakan kolam renang secara pribadi. Staf yang selalu membantu dan layanan kamar dari beberapa restoran berafiliasi dengan tempat ini bekerja dengan  cepat dan tepat, Meskipun apa pun yang Anda butuhkan berjarak sangat dekat. Jalan masuk pribadi ke pantai juga bagus (meskipun sering banjir selama musim hujan, sekedar tip!). Secara keseluruhan tempat ini ramah, bersih, proses check-in dan check-out yang mudah dan praktis, dan pengunjung lainnya yang bersahabat.\n\nSatu-satunya kekurangan dari SEMUA aspek positif yang kita dapat adalah dispenser air kosong ketika kami tiba dan kita harus membayar untuk menggantinya (kami pikir hal ini termasuk bagian dari tarif kamar). Kami juga tidak menyadari internet wifi harus dibeli dengan kartu prabayar, dan kartu 5 jam yang kami beli pasti tidak memberi kami 5 jam yang senilai - namun bukan salah tempat ini, tapi merupakan tanggung jawab penyedia internet. Hal ini bukan masalah besar karena pada dasarnya di Bali di mana-mana tersedia wifi gratis!\n\nSaya pasti merekomendasikan Beach Apartments Melati untuk orang yang mencari tempat yang lebih santai dan privat namun dekat dengan pusat aktvitas (tapi lihatlah di peta sebelumnya untuk menemukan beberapa tujuan, karena sopir taksi kami mengalami kesulitan menemukannya!)",

Anything we asked for help with was offered by the staff. Breaky we had across the road at the cafe - but the kitchen could easily be used to make meals which might be really useful if you had small children or a baby. Central position. quick walk down the laneway to the beach. Rooms cleaned each day. Great little pool to relax around.",

It was my daughters birthday and they surprised us with signs and ballons and gave her a cake when we returned from a day out.\nOne O Restaurant across the road does the best breakfasts, we ate there every morning, he beach is only a 3 minute walk, we usually cut through the hotel beside the apartments. \nThe staff mentioned they were closing for renovations with the pool and other things, can\u2019t wait to see the changes next time we stay hopefully 2020.\nThank you once again for having us, we always enjoy our stays at the apartments.",

              "text": "Wow... totally recommend...just spent 10 days in Beach Melati Apartments in Legian, as family of 4. What an awesome position.... right in the heart of Legian... close to everything (directly across from Poco Loco and next door to Romeos) and priced so cheap. Many restaurants to choose from right outside the door.. laundry service across the road ($1.50 a kg). Started in a 2 bdrm apartment, then upgraded to a 3 bdrm. Both so spacious, Comfy beds, 3 bdrm can sleep 7 without using large sofas and daybed. So clean, and most important - the best water pressure in the showers and never ran out of hot water once. Apartments as shown on website. Pool was great, gets lots of sun. Very quiet for where it is positioned, so close to everything. Upstairs had the best ocean breeze. The staff were so accommodating and very friendly. We will definitely found our home base in Legian for all our holidays.",

              "text": "We stayed here for 10 nights in april. Our room was fantasic with 2 rooms inside the 1 apartment. The second room had 2 single beds which was perfect for my teenage children who didnt want to sleep together. The apartment is equipped with a toaster, microwave and all plates,cups etc. We Made breakfast every morning in the apartment and then ate out for lunch and dinners. Hubby loved the large sized fridge in the apartment enough for all his bintang. The lovely staff clean your apartment daily but most days we asked for towels only. There is always a staff member on duty. You cant walk down the laneway anymore to the beach as its blocked off due to renovations in the Villas at the back. One o across the road is great we ordered cocktails around the pool with them. La Monde down the road further is also a winner. They have a small 24 hour shop in the front of the apartments where we stocked up on drinks and snacks. Yuda man picked us up from the airport, he was there on time to greet us and is such a funny guy. They also can organise tours for you. \nThank you again for our wonderful stay we Will be back next year \nSutherlands family",

I have always loved staying in this spacious apartment and was surprised to find it has had a refurbishment. Beautiful furniture in all rooms, new colour scheme and new curtains throughout. Felt like it was a different apartment but with all the same amenities. I always feel as if it is home as Jinae the manager is very welcoming and so helpful in all ways. The staff have been there for years and are all wonderful. It is so nice to see them all happy at work. It is in a great position with restaurants just outside. Very convenient to have a super market out the front with an  honest money changer as well. Once behind the walls of this complex it is very quiet and secure. I am looking forward to my next visit. Will definitely stay in 105 again.",

Terrific location and near to shops, money changers, restaurants, spas and best of all the beach. You now need to access the beach via the Ossotel which is an extra few minutes but worth it as the little local family on the beach we always sit at are wonderful. Try Benny's Thirsty Camel Bar.....no cost bean bags, cheap drinks and lovely home cooked food.  Back to Melati for a swim in the pool and relax while using wifi - great strong connection. No complaints. Will always stay here.",

              "text": "I recently stayed at Beach Melati apartments with two girlfriends. The apartments are situated centrally in Legian between the Camakila and the Ossotel. There are 12 apartments over 3 levels with 2 x 3 bedroom apartments on the top level. I think the other 10 apartments are all two bedroom. Our apartment was on the second level. The apartment was enormous, with two bedrooms containing a king size bed & two king singles. It had a huge lounge room and fully self contained kitchen. Our apartment also had a water cooler. For $3 you can arrange for a container of water for the cooler (a nice touch would be for this to be a free option). The bathroom was also large & well maintained. I felt safe the whole stay as security is at the property 24/7. Whilst the apartments were full for most of our stay we pretty much had the pool all to our selves. There is only room for 5 sun beds around the pool and the pool is only small but was perfect for cooling down in. The central location gave easy access to shopping, restaurants & the beach. If you want icy cold bintangs, turn left at the front and follow the road around until you find \u201ckevins\u201d convenience store. He keeps a dozen beers in the freezer and was happy for us to borrow a basket to transport our purchase. We had a fabulous time & will be back with our families next time. ",

Once you walk through the gates it is a peaceful oasis. \nHowever the best part of our stay is always the staff. \nJinae, Yuda, Tingko, Aris, Wayan and Juli are so very kind and helpful to everyone. Nothing is a problem and they are always happy to have a chat or to provide help when needed. ( sorry if I have left out anyone)\nWe took friends with us this time and they loved it also. \nThank You to Beach Melati Apartments",

Found Beach Melati online and from the pictures it looked the same as the Bali Court architecturally.  Booking was pleasantly cordial with Jinae, as we requested a two bedroom unit on the second with lots of light.  On arrival, we were booked into 201 and it was perfect!  Quiet, private, spacious and comfortable.  Full size refrigerator, microwave, a good desk and side working area.  A long table at the back of the great L-shaped sofa. The AC worked well.  This apartment has it's own staircase from the outside.  The bedrooms are at the back of the apartment and very quiet. We would have like a chaise for the balcony and robe hooks in the bathroom and bedrooms.  It's a few seconds walk to the main road there Jl Padma Utara, the the One-O Restaurant across the street is delicious.  We had dinner a couple of times at the Niksoma next door, the Souvlaki  Greek Restaurant and Sasa Italian Restaurant on Double Six (Jl Arjuna)  All scrumptious!  A cab ride will take you to the Bali Bakery restaurant on Jl. Imam Bonjoul (across from Centro Parkir where the buses park)--also a favorite of ours!  Getting back to the Beach Melati,For two nights we had a ground floor 2 bedroom apt next  to the pool--all the ground floor apartments are poolside, so if you like being near the pool, these are for you!  201 had been booked for those two nights, so we packed up, the staff moved our luggage, it was easy.  The staff is friendly and very helpful, and under the pressure of an earthquake which happened during our stay, they alerted everyone and made sure we were all out and onto the street. Beach Melati is a winner!",

Travelled with husband and adult son, and we all agreed we will definitely return. We stayed in a ground floor apartment, and it was huge! Breakfast is not included, and this suited us, as there were so many options within a 2 minute walk. I would highly recommend Beach Melati Apartments.",

On the Seminyak/Legian border, it is walking distance to beach, restaurants etc, and out of the Kuta noise!  We were delayed a day by volcano ash, and the manager Jinae could not have been more helpful.  We were able to stay in our room until a return flight could be confirmed.  Been to Bali a few times and would highly recommend this complex.",

We arrived at 3am and had the security/reception guy waiting for us he help carrying all the bags up to the third level, to our amazing apartment. It was so good we s not so much more time there because it was so good, you could sit on the balcony and look down on Padma Ultera street and just sook in the atmosphere.  Great food across the road for breakfast lunch and tea. Poco loco with a kids playground was also great place to eat just across the road. Will be back for sure",

We were two families staying in two seperate ground floor apartments, between us we had 4 children between the ages of 6 and 10. During the day the children naturally wanted to swim in the pool, at all times there were at least 2 adults supervising them. They were happy, laughing, splashing etc as all children do. We had 5 older family members in 2 apartments upstairs who said the children were no problem. Almost from the first day a lady in another ground floor apt complained about the noise and splashing. We tried to keep the children out of the pool as much as we could, and were often away doing other activities, however the complaints came every time the children were in the pool. This really affected our enjoyment of our holiday and we felt very uncomfortable! The children were never unruly or undisciplined, they were just enjoying the pool on a hot day! Don't stay here if you have children who wish to use the pool! ",

Location is pretty good, close to the beach (although you have to walk through a very small pathways) lots of restaurants, shops, and massages place around. \n\nThey weren't very good with correspondence. I had to call them many times about reservation and after finally talking with somebod, she said I have to email to make a reservation. After I emailed, I got the respond few days later. I also emailed them about an airport transfer but I never got the respond until the morning before I left to Bali. I tried to call them and nobody answered. I texted a cellphone number and got a reply that said they didn't get any email from me about airport transfer?\nWhen I arrived at the hotel, there were nobody around, I didn't know the tiny little room was the receptionist room. So, I walked in to somebody else's room, I thought that was the check-in room.",

Unfortunately encountered a couple of families who gave no thought whatsoever to the other guests and the parents had no idea about respect and couldn't even see the problems their children were creating. We have nothing but absolute praise for the staff and management of Melati and can't wait to come back. Thank you to a brilliant team of people. ",

We had no idea why. We then find that we had been sent a warning email, then a second email telling us that we're being evicted from the apartments. All news to us. Our kids were supposedly making too much noise and splashing water while playing in the pool. We hardly used the pool while we were there. Our kids were by no means excessively noisy, just normal kids playing in a pool on holiday. We suspect the complaint came from one elderly woman who seemed to be a semi permanent resident there. They tried telling us there had been four seperate complaints but that was just rubbish as most of the apartments there had been booked by family and friends. We were gobsmacked at being treated the way we were. Don't choose these apartments if you have children who enjoy a dip in the pool while in their holidays!",

The behavior of your group (consisting of 3 apartments out of 12) was disruptive and annoying to other guests. Our staff spoke to your children on numerous occasions when they were throwing rocks or bombing into the pool. Their behavior made it impossible for other guests to use the pool area which was constantly flooded with water pouring out our gates. The children ignored the staff's requests to stop. After receiving 4 written complaints from 3 other guests we emailed asking that the children be supervised. Other guests were then bullied with comments about them complaining and felt very uncomfortable whenever your group were there. We discussed the matter with booking .com who advised us how to handle your booking and assisted us in wording our email asking you to leave with the offer of a refund for remaining nights. Their other suggestion was that we involve the police which we were not keen to do. After our manager met with you, you asked if you could please stay for the remainder of your booking and promised that there would be no more noise from your children. We agreed to your request. \nWe have many many families with children of all ages who have been staying with us for years and we have never had to speak to them about their disruptive behavior.  \nRead our other reviews. Most from families who love staying with us. ",

It was nice to be away from the hustle and have peace and quiet but still have everything conveniently close. The apartment was clean, well decorated and very spacious. It was nice to have a fridge, freezer and bench space to prepare snacks etc and not have to go out to eat all the time. In saying that, there are many restaurants etc within a minutes walk and you are spoilt for choice for eating options. There are several minimarts nearby and a same day service laundry. \nThe staff here were lovely, friendly and courteous and the pool was just amazing. We enjoyed our morning coffee watching the kids swim in the pool!\nWe will definitely come and stay here again.",

Late arrival, driver waiting, who escorted us to our accommodation and check in sorted next morning. That set the scene of what was a lovely stay. Laid back, friendly, engaging staff. Jinae the Aussie manager could sort any problems, not that we had many, and had good local knowledge. The living area of the apartment was huge, with good sized bedrooms. Big screen TV in lounge and flat screens in 2 of the bedrooms. The hot/cold water dispenser cost 30,000RP ($3 AUD) for 19 litres and the boys would go get one and have it installed when we got back from lunch. Our balcony overlooked the pool and street, which I would watch while having my morning coffee, enjoying the banter between street vendors and tourists. A 24 hr Circle K 50m from front of building and \"One O\" directly across the road for great brekkies which they would deliver if I called and asked (They let me take a menu back to our apartment), bars and restaurants within easy walking distance made the location ideal. My son would take the alleyway to the beach for surf and beers with locals. Although there was some street noise in the mornings, it didn't really bother us. Thanks Jinae and boys for a great stay, we'll be back.",

The staff were all so happy and helpful and nothing was to much trouble.\nThe apartments are very well situated, in close proximity to good food, plenty of shopping and the beach.\ni do think however that these apartments would be better suited to Adults not young families. The pool is an ok size but is very deep and even the shallow area would not be suitable for toddlers or young children. the pool is also situated in the middle of the courtyard , right outside the front doors of the ground floor apartments. All in all this accommadation offers great value for money and i will definitely be returning.",

There's a walk way (short cut) for you to go to the beach. It's like less then 10 mins or maybe less then 5 mins i would say. They do house keeping as well. Love it. Already planing for a second visit there. :))",

I have stayed here many times, as a couple, with a small group of friends, large groups and recently on my own. My last few trips I must admit I have stayed at a variety of other hotels and villas and on my last Bali visit chose to come back to these beautiful apartments and realised how much I had missed staying here. The location can't be beaten, everything is right on your doorstep, the best coffee at Mugshots, great shopping, food and a very short stroll to the beach. The apartments are very well maintained, super clean and comfortable. It is very quiet and very safe. Jinae is incredible, she will organise and help with anything you need, so welcoming and great to chat with. The boys are great fun and help with anything you ask.\nPlease don't hesitate in booking these apartments for your Bali stay, you won't be disappointed, what you see in the pics is what you get and nothing beats the atmosphere that Jinae and her team provide. Can't wait to see you again, and thank you.",

Situated in a quieter part from the hussle and bussle but still had all the restos and other services right outside. Staff were good however there welcoming should be worked on instead of immediately asking payment.  It didnt help especially when we had a delayed flight and was not in the mood for such approach.  Car access is non existing and you had to lug your luggage all yourself. Didnt help when you have a child. Apart from that we enjoyed it esecially that side alley to the beach around the corner.",

The reason for this is that unfortunately some guests would depart without paying so we changed our payment conditions several years ago.\nIt is unfortunate your flight was delayed however this was out of our control. \nI understand that our staff helped with your luggage when you arrived and assisted with carrying your stroller to the apartment whenever they were there and could see you leaving or arriving.\nI agree it is difficult to park a car in our area unless you are staying in one of the big resorts like Jayakarta or Ramada who have car parking available. They also have lifts available which might make it easier for your access with yur child.\nThank you for taking the time to post a review.\n",

The pool is nice as well where we dont need to share with too many people. We like the private feeling of the apartment and the space. \n\nWhat we dont fancy is that the apartment has no car access. And no lift, which was hard with a baby and a stroller.\n\nWhat we think this place needs improvement is the way the staff welcome the guest. When we arrived, we had delayed flight with a 6 months old baby, so we were very tired. The staff straight away asked us to pay the balance. It would be nice if the staff welcomed us with smile, and cold drinks. Or even offered us to sit. It wasnt a nice experience when we arrive. You should train your staff to be nice, friendly to guest when they just arrive from delayed flight. Your front office staff needs more customer service training. But it was only one that staff who had an attitude. The rest of your staff were nice n friendly.\n\nThank you for having us.",

So that was piece of mind. \n\nOur two bedroom apartment was tastefully decorated, spacious, very clean & comfortable.  \n\nBeach Melati is on a busy road but we never had any issues with noise once inside our apartment. \n\nStaff were friendly & nothing was ever a problem for them. \n\nLocation is ideal. Just step outside the front door and you're there. Plenty of food, pubs, massage parlours etc. \n\nWe also loved that the Kura-Kura bus drives right past the front door. $2 a ticket will get you anywhere around Bali. \n\nWill definitely stay again!",

The location was excellent - walking distance to garlic lane and a range of highly rated restaurants. we all pushed the staff with inane requests which included: transport bookings to Ubud, lost camera's - Michael...., requests for best restaurants etc and the staff responded with kindness and professionalism. The room were large and comfortable, wifi was excellent and pool area brilliant for a large group. We only had one toliet with two teenagers... sigh... but that was my only complaint... \n\nIn my mother's words aka \"Joycey\" :My friend Margaret and I loved our time with you. She had never travelled overseas before so being in Bali was an experience for her.We loved our apartment and how close to the beach it was as well as the restaurants and massages.  We will come again. Your staff were so helpful and supportive when Michael lost his camera.\n \noverall.... a well run, comfortable, large, well located and brilliantly serviced apartment - we will be back :)",

Fantastic location.\nJust a couple of minor negatives - my children all received grazing on the bottom of their toes from the base of the small pool; and Reception wasn't able to make phone calls for me prior to 9.30am.",

The apartments were very spacious and came equipped with everything you need. The location was fantastic and the staff very kind and accommodating.\nWe will definitely be looking to stay here again. \nSorry, I don't have any photos but if anything the photos on the website don't do the place justice, it better in person. Another positive note was how quiet it was inside of the apartments, no street noise at all.",

After a lot of looking online and on tripadvisor I thought that it was the place for me at the right price and the right location. And it was and more . Lots of room,1 bedroom and a loungeroom + kitchen. 1/2 hour walk down to Kutas bemo corner and the same towards seminyak(on the beach)\nIt beats a small hotel room any time.\nThe only problem I had was to find a good cappuchino on my walks .Never mind ,the Bintang was always cold . Yes I would go there again.",

But as soon as we opened the front entry gates and walked in, our spirits lifted immediately. The pool area and the way the hotel positions itself around it look fantastic. \nWhen we were taken to our room we were even more pleasantly surprised at the open space and the fact we had been upgraded to a two bedroom apartment.\nThe unit was exceptionally clean and our bedding was super comfortable.\nApart from the security person who let us in we haven't come across any staff, but so far so good.\nBeach Melati Apartments are definitely Italy recommended.",

              "text": "We just got back from Bali (last weekend). We stayed at Apartment #103 (1 bedroom) on the ground floor. We were very pleased with the unit because:\n\n1. The unit was huge. It had 1 spacious bedroom with a TV, a closet, an ironing board and a safe deposit box. The bathroom was spacious, too (shower only, no bath tub). The living room was quite big, with an L-shapped sofa, another TV & dvd player. The kitchen was compact yet complete, equipped with a microwave, huge sink, tablewares, an electronic water kettle, 2-door fridge & a bread toaster.\n\n2. The swimming pool was right in front of our door. Yes, there was a kid's pool, my boys could swim without making me worry too much. And most importantly, the pool was clean.\n\n3. The apartment was well-managed & well-decorated. Really felt like my own home... but better... Because I don't have to clean it myself hahaha..\n\n4. The Legian beach was in walking distance. But we had to go through a narrow alley. Don't want to know how it's like when it's dark...\n\n5. We had a pretty decent sleep at night, though there were some people lounging & chatting around the swimming pool, & a live-music bar across the street. And we were so lucky to have nice & friendly neighbours, that they didn't make any irritating noise.\n\nHowever, the downsides were:\n1. No car parking space. If you bring a car, you will have to park it at an empty lawn near the hotel (ask for the staff's help to guide you there).\n\n2. The floor was somehow dusty or sandy, even though I knew they had already cleaned our unit. And no in-room slippers. (Yup, this was a problem for me as a clean-freak).\n\n3. In the bathroom, there were only 2 bath towels, no hand towel. And only 1 floor mat, which was not absorbent enough. And my boys kept walking back-and-forth from the pool to our unit. \n\n4. When we checked in, we were asked to pay in advance for our booking. We found this was a bit inconvenient for us, because we weren't informed about this matter when we made our booking. (We were only asked to pay the deposit).\n\nConclusion: yes, I would definitely recommend this accommodation.\n\nI don't provide any photos of the apartment here. But you can see them in Google & TripAdvisor, the photos were true. Although the swimming pool looked bigger in the photos, if I might say..",

Lots of shops, restaurants, coffee shops, massage places and taxis come through all the time.  The appartment had loads of room and the TV was big and the area is great for all visitors to Bali.  The only downside was the bathroom was in the main bedroom which might be a bit odd for those not travelling with fellow family members.  All staff friendly and instant communcation by email from overseas.  Can highly recommend.",

Whether you are travelling as a family or in a group this is the perfect place to stay. Apartments are clean and beautifully furnished. Staff are friendly and go out of their way to provide anything you require. They go above and beyond and we now consider them part of our family. Recently we traveled to Bali for a birthday celebration with a large group. Beach Melati Appartments was the perfect setting for pre and post party celebrations. They assisted with sourcing catering and went out of their way to make the celebration an event to remember. \n\nThe Apartments are in a central location, close to shops, restaurants, cafes and just a short walk to the beach. Relax by the pool in a well maintained, relaxing, secluded environment or watch the kids romp in it's crystal clear water.\n\nJust thinking about it makes me homesick for the place and the people. Do yourself a favour an book a trip now. You won't be disappointed!",

              "text": "This is our second stay at the Beach Melati and it was just as good as the first.\nWe had the two bedroom on the ground floor, which is perfect for us with two small kids.\nThe apartment was modern and spacious with everything you need. The staff kept it clean and tidy daily and nothing was ever too much to ask.\nIt is so central to everything you need, restaurants and the beach literally a minute away, but as soon as you walk into the apartment block it's as if you leave it all behind. This also made us feel really safe of a night as it is secure and has night security also.\nThe pool is beautiful and clean and very rarely do the guests overlap swim times, so we usually had it to ourselves!\nThe cafe out the front does amazing food and were more than happy to deliver it to the room, which is great with the kids.\nThe staff are all great. Jinae makes the booking process so easy and the boys are super friendly and awesome with the kids.\nMy only tip, When staying on the ground floor, ask for rooms on the beach side of the apartment block as it can be pretty noisy at night next to the road as the restaurant over the road plays live music and the locals hang out the front. In saying that, we stayed there a month and I wouldn't say I ever lost sleep.\nIf you like to be central, but avoid the super touristy crowd - this is the place!",

Although it is at the front of the building no outside noise could be heard. The staff were always friendly and ensured the entire complex was clean and tidy and were more than helpful with any request we made. Excellent location central to many restaurants and the beach. Would definitely recommend staying here especially those looking for somewhere quiet without the crowds of the large resort.",

The rooms were quiet, immaculate and cleaned daily.  The pool area is divine.  The best cafe's and restaurants are all at your doorstep.  Room service is available from the cafe out the front. The security is excellent and we felt safe at all times.  The Manager Jinae gave us the best advice on local tours and attractions. It is perfectly placed close to the beach and away from the hustle and bustle.  The price very reasonable for such a beautiful complex - Highly recommended!!",

The apartments are clean and well decorated, the staff is amazing and willing to assist whenever needed. For the price this place is amazing. Its a quiet complex and you will definitely make new friends! Beds are very comfortable, the whole apartment feels like your at home. Perfect for families especially with little ones as it has a fully equipped kitchen and a shallow part of the pool just for them. We will be staying there again when we go back in January! There is a private lane way that takes you straight to the beach, and it is in a great spot. Your away from the Kuta nightlife but close enough to walk there (10mins max.) Pretty much your smack bang in the middle of Kuta and Seminyak! Couldn't recommend this place more highly!",

There were only a few others staying here at this time of the year so it was very quiet.  The apartments are all of a good size (I had a look at all of the empty ones) and very in design.  Each apartment has been decorated by their owners so each have a unique feel to them.  The common out door area is well maintained with plenty of space and seating.  I understand the area around the pool has just been retiled so it has a fresh newish feel to it.  The pool was a great temperature, very refreshing and was in the sun for most of the day.  The apartments were cleaned daily to a high standard.  Although close to  Jalan Padma Utara and it's shops, there was no noise.  There are plenty of restaurants and cafes close by and the beach is only a couple of minutes walk away.  I wold definitely stay here again.",

Beach in front of apartment is a cool beach, serve drinks and the food stalls also good. Teenagers loved night life and we enjoyed restaurants and bars. If you want some city action this is a great place to stay for a few days.",

We stayed in a two-bedroom suite on the ground floor next to the pool, which is nice for access but can be noisy if there's a crowd at the pool. The room was well appointed and clean, with a large suite containing the kitchen, living and dining areas fronting the bedrooms and bath in back. It was more spacious than expected. The staff were courteous and helpful. We had booked a 4-night stay and had to shorten it due to a change in plan and the manager accepted the change without charging a penalty, which was an unexpected pleasant surprise.",

The master bedroom is bathed in natural light, and has a huge king bed. The other two bedrooms are lovely, the third one with 2 single beds is small, but does the job. Each has a TV, plus a huge TV in the living area. \nThe living area is huge. Wonderful big balcony where we spent mornings drinking coffee. The pool was a highlight for me - deep and crystal clear. The complex is secluded and very secure. We felt very safe here. \nThere is no restaurant because these are private apartments, but you can get food delivered plus there are loads of places to eat very close. The beach is literally a 300m walk down a path and through a locked gate. Spa across the road for cheap massages and pedicures. \nI would highly recommend beach Melati for girls trip or romantic couple getaway. No kids was perfect for us! (we are teachers and didn't want screaming brats destroying our retreat) \nJinae is friendly and welcoming, as are all the staff. \nI'd love to come back one day. Extremely good value for money. ",

Our unit 302 on the  top level was huge, clean and beautifully furnished, the big verandah with a full size day bed and out door table and chairs came in very handy.  All the staff are extremely friendly the beautiful Jinae even helped organise and deliver to the restaurant a surprise bday cake for my hubby. The service we received every day was just awesome. Would highly recommend this property, we are already planning our next holiday and will definately be staying at the fabulous Beach Melati Apartments. ",

As it turned out dad didn't make it to Bali due to the volcano and flight cancellations so we had the 2 bedroom apartment to ourselves and it was wonderful, particularly coming from a live aboard dive boat where we had shared a cabin for 8 days. Really convenient location, clean and comfortable apartment, friendly reception and housekeeping staff and its so much more relaxed than staying in a hotel. The beds were super comfy, living area well fitted out and the convenience of kitchenette is great. Only downside for me was that the pool area is quite small with only a few sun lounges and whilst its probably good for some that its shaded all day, I personally like a bit of sun to dry off after a swim and had to sit on the edge of the pool to do that. Would highly recommend as a very affordable option if you have a party of 3 or more.",

The staff were very friendly and were happy to have a chat. The pool is small but great for a dip at the end of a day of shopping or beach swimming. It is in the heart of Legian and is close to many amenities including breakfast at Crazy Cookz and motorbike hire downstairs off 'Rastaman.' Would definitely recommend to friends and would be lucky to come back here again!",

Our stay at Beach Melati Apartments was fantastic. the 2 bedroom apartment was spacious, modern, well presented and just what we needed and the staff were friendly and always happy to help. the local restaurants were happy to deliver to the apartments for those dinners after a long day or breakfasts while getting the kids ready in the morning. its a short walk down the private lane to the beach. my wifes parents also stayed at the same time as us and they loved their apartment too. It is in a great location and you can't go wrong with this place.",

The pool area was taken over by loud Bogan Australians and their children.  Having been going to Bali every year for the past 20 years it was the first place I felt was a total rip off. Not because of the price... Just because of the tone of the place. We left and moved to another place and were way happier. I think we were a bad fit for the place - if you like loud Aussies bombdiving in pools at 10pm and smoking and drinking all day around a pool that's right outside your window you'll probably love the place.",

This time we stayed in 205, a 2 bedroom with a good balconey and more than enough space to make us comfortable (and I had my mother in law with us!). A modest size apartment complex in a convenient part of Legian that is serviced, maintained and managed by a top team of very friendly and reliable staff. Thanks again.",

The hotel & pool area is very clean. Our room was on the ground floor facing the pool. Wi-fi is free and had good connection. \nWe travelled with friends who stayed in the 3 bedroom apartment on the top floor and that was enormous, it also had a large outdoor deck area with sun lounges & outdoor setting. We travelled with 6 kids between our 2 families, so the apartments were great giving everyone plenty of space to spread out. The location is perfect, really close to many great restaurants, day spas, shopping, mugshot coffee, money changers & a short walk down the lane to the beach. \nThe staff Jinae, Yuda, Wayan and the other boys are really friendly and make you feel very welcome, nothing is too much trouble. We organised our airport transfers and a day trip through them and the prices were very reasonable.\nThere is no restaurant in the hotel, but there are several close by that will deliver straight to your room.\nThere are only 12 apartments in the complex and while its located on a busy road, once you step inside the front gates you feel miles away from the hustle & bustle going on outside the hotel walls. We loved Beach Melati and will definately stay there again.",

We had arrived from a very good cruise from the UK via Singapore and were used to things being smart and well done, so were pleased to find that our two bed apartment was large, perfectly clean and had all the stuff we needed including two TVs and two fridges! It was serviced very efficiently every day. Jinnae the manager is very friendly knowledgeable and helpful as are the small team who are on hand every day.  This is quite a small complex with about 10 or 11 apartments grouped on 3 storeys around the pool but it is perfectly located in Legian close to all amenities and with it's own path to the beach, about 300 metres away. Check out Tiger's Itchy Bum Beach Bar! Despite it being in the thick of things we were never disturbed at night by noise and the beds are really comfy! Possibly because of it's size we found it a very friendly place and have made good friends with lots of our neighbours, including the lovely and knowledgeable Debra O! Our first visit to Bali and won't be our last - despite the flight! We will come back here!",

Wi-Fi was good, too. If the shower had a bit more pressure it would have been even greater. Jinae and her staff were fantastic \u2013 they are friendly, but not overly like some other places - help us whenever we need and leave us relaxed other times. There was a warm friendly & relaxing atmosphere in the place and that made us feel secure staying there all time. We also liked the location, everything was within walking distance, but the street wasn't too hustle-bustled. There were some nice warungs and caf\u00e9s nearby, too. We\u2019d love to go back with friends and stay in 2 bedroom apartment that looked even better!",

We stayed in 302, and while a second bathroom would have been handy, the people watching from our street view balcony is a winner. we had a sticky beak at 301 and that looked great too, with a second bathroom just not much to look at from the balcony. The staff were great, the guys who cleaned our room friendly and nothing too much trouble. One point - our toilet brush was atrocious. When the guys clean they have their own so didn't use the one left in the room, i'm sure if i had of brought this to their attention it would have been replaced. i hear the pool area is getting renovated early next year which will only add to this great holiday destination. We travelled as a family with two adult sons and a 13 yr old daughter, we had plenty of room and our daughter could walk up to Circle K and other surrounding shops with us able to watch out for her from the balcony. See you next year Beach Melati... :)",

There is just a great friendly relaxed vibe around the complex.  We stayed in 201 this time, great in every way except the shower had no pressure at all.  Spoke to Jinae and it was looked at immediately. The apartments are in a great spot, easy walk to beach, shopping, best coffee at Mug Shots, Luna Spa right across the road, circle k just steps away, quick taxi ride to Bintang supermarket....really is a convenient location. Don't hesitate in giving the Apartments a go, you will love them.  If you don't mind a little bit of street noise would recommend 302, 3bedroom with balcony that has a street view, great for people watching!!!! 301 is awesome if you don't want the street option. We have stayed half a dozen times and will continue to stay again.....thanks Jinae and Beach Melati Apartments, can't wait to be back.",

              "text": "I have travelled to Bali on many occasions and in fact I have stayed in the resorts on either side of this place and had never even known it was there, Tucked away down a beautiful tree lined lane is the melati beach. once inside the gates you are in your own little oasis. It's small, only 11 apartments inside the complex but it's beautifully formed. The pool, is only small but it's all you need and the beach is only 200 meters down the lane. \nEach unit is different, some are only 2 bedroom but the best and most spacious are the two 3 bedroom ones on the top floor. Having said that all the apartments are large and spacious. The rooms all have kitchens so for the budget conscious, it's great to be able to prepare a meal or make breakfast because it's not included.  The staff are wonderful, friendly and helpful and the rooms are cleaned everyday. In fact we have returned to our rooms to find that they had even washed the dishes and put them away. Nothing seems to be a problem for them. All the rooms have lovely outside areas with tables and chairs. The wifi is free and always has a good signal. \nFor a family or large group looking for accommodation where you can all be close, this place would be hard to beat. The aircon is great, the fridge is big, the beds are comfy and the location is super.\nAs with any place there are compromises here. The pool is very deep, it must be 8 foot, so if you are not a competent swimmer that can be a problem, the little pool to the side is shallow but for me who had my 18 month old grand daughter with me it was not appropriate. The pool is being renovated in May and is going to be made more \"user friendly\" and that will solve that problem.  The room we were in 204 and the one next door 205 while being 2 of the nicest room also back onto the street and were at times a little noisier than the ones that don't but again it was a small compromise.  The 3 bedroom apartments are on the top floor and are huge. Easily sleep 7 in comfort. I actually thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the melati beach and would definitely return but not with a small child. This place is not toddler friendly!!!!!. For a wedding party and guests or for a large family gathering I don't think you could go past it for price, location or convenience. The few compromises are not enough to deter me from returning. There are 2 great day spas 100 meters from the door, a great little cafe adjoining and undoubtedly the best coffee in Bali at \" mugshots\" across the road. If your after a 5 star experience, this is not the place for you but if your after a home away from home experience, this is hard to find. My suggestion for rooms would be anything on the second or third floor. If you have small kids room 202 and 301 as they can be contained on private balconies. \nIn May while the pool is being renovated the apartments are going to be super cheap so if you don't mind the 200 meter walk down to the beach and a little inconvenience, it would be a super cheap holiday with great accomodation, just a thought....",

First time was at New Years with a girlfriend when unfortunately there was an airborne bug going around that not too many people missed coming down with.  Second time was in July with my partner who usually very much enjoys staying in a villa but was able to easily convince him that this is where we should stay in the future. Was great to be able to chat with others staying there and made both trips even more enjoyable. Complex and rooms are kept very clean and it's central to everything you need.  Loved being able to decide what we wanted for breakfast - toast by the pool or popping over the road for a fry up.  For those who like the buffet style breakfast, you can always pay to have that in one of the larger resorts around but we didn't bother.  Second bedroom doesn't have any wardrobe space as it's locked up with the owners contents. Think it does need something unless you are happy to keep everything in the drawers and your suitcase.  Very spacious as are all the apartments.  Shame you can't get through to the beach down gage alleyway anymore but still can't wait to come back again and again and again!!",

For the best part of the time it was very quiet, except when people above us, dragged their chairs over the floor. We stayed in 201, and it felt as if we were very private, with our own stairway. It was lovely to have breakfast overlooking the pool. Beds were very comfortable, but the hot water would take time to reach the shower, but we welcomed the pressure from the shower. Space to spread out is a bonus when there are 3 females travelling together. We would love to come back in the future, as the location is perfect for shopping, eating and doing all the things we like to do. Only downside is the traffic congestion if the is a celebration happening at the temple. Just get out of the taxi and walk. But for the most part, it is fine. Well recommended. Thanks for the lovely stay and pleasant staff.",

On our travels we observed the Beach Lounge (which is a part of this hotel). We checked the menu and to our surprise they did a rather cheap breakfast. There are colourful couches and umbrellas out the front which are great to sit on in the morning and in the afternoon. The next day we decided to give it a try. The staff were very quick to provide menus and take our order. We had a nice breakfast for the 2 of us and ordered juices and coffees and the total came to approx 150k which was fantastic. We further had breakfast there another 6 times i would say directly due to the price, locality and great service from the team. We further attended in the afternoon on a couple occasions while walking back to our hotel for a cheap drink (bintang was around 20k, from 5pm-7pm down to 17k and large selection of cocktails were 50k each) and to enjoy the view (somewhat hampered by the trees and beach wall in front but was still able to watch the surf and the hussle and bustle going past on the main beach front street.)",

There was plenty of room for everyone to have their space and to come together and share some fun around the large lounge room and dining room table. Having the water filter was excellent as we were using quite a lot of bottled water to steralize bottles and feed twins. The kitchen had everything you could want. We really didn't cook though as many of the local restaurants deliver if you want to stay in/or need to get the kids to bed early sometimes. Its a great location, close to the beach, shops and restaurants. Highly recommended for a large family as its so hard to find hotels that will accommodate you and guarantee interconnecting rooms. Its also an economical way to accommodate a large family. The only down side to the lovely small and quiet facilities is that there is less opportunities for the kids to interact with other kids, not such a big deal though as there is so much else to get out and about and do.",

Apart from the small courtyard pool there are no grounds to stroll in but there are plenty of places to walk along the esplanade, etc.  We found this a great contrast to several days in a resort. The staff were very helpful, especially in permitting a very late checkout if you have a night flight home.  The rooms are reasonably new and have everything you could wish.  Breakfast at a cafe a few door up is only $6 each and reliable massage facilities are also handy at similarly low prices.  Did I mention the shops... and the people are so friendly.",

This was not the managements fault ,it was bad parenting. We will return to Beach Melati",

We were a group of 4 females and found it safe with everything right outside your door (day spa, tailor & mug shot coffee).  Walked in the mornings on the beach which was accessible from the lane-way.  Breakfast is not included but I took my own cereal and brought milk and fruit.  The kitchen is well equipped if you also wanted to cook meals but with so many good cheap restaurants nearby why would you. It was quiet when we stayed and had the pool to ourselves most of the time. Very modern and clean.  Would stay again.",

              "text": "Stayed at Beach Melati Apartments for 2 weeks on the recommendation of a friend. Apartments are modern and great location - closer to Seminyak end of Legian. Small pool, great coffee shop attached to the apartments where you can also get breakfast (breakfast not included in the room price but there is a fully equiped kitchen that you can  make your own food). I would call the complex a small boutique style as it's only 3 levels. All apartments are privately owned so not all are the same decor. Had everything you needed in the rooms, nice bathroom, kitchen, lounge, flat screen tv, dvd player, etc. As for price, for a single, it is probably a bit expensive, however if you had a few people staying, it works out very economical, and you are getting the same standard room as a 5 star hotel - without having to pay for staff and all the other trimmings that you wouldn't use anyway. It does not back onto the beach but is only a 5 minute walk to Legian beach. Right next door to the Ramada Camakila Hotel. If you want to book, I'd suggest booking at least 6 months before as the rooms book out very quickly. No parking for cars but you could park a motorbike out the front on the road. No lift but stairs to upper floors.",

The apartments are HUGE....which was such a pleasant suprise as it meant our group of friends didn't have to sit on top of each other for the week we were there. The apartment complex is very boutique and with only about 9 apartments in the complex we didn't feel overwhelmed with other people and it was truely relaxing. The pool was lovely and never crouded and the staff were really helpful and very friendly. \nThe added bonus of a cafe at the front door that would deliver iced coffee and fresh fruit juice to the apartment really topped off a great stay at Beach Melati Apartments.",

Our first trip we stayed in 104 (downstairs right next to the pool) and the second in 202 (upstairs with balconies and four poster bed). \n\nThe beauty of the Beach Melati is that you get a whole apartment in a private quiet location with a lovely pool for much less $$ than equivalent accommodation in a  resort. The staff are friendly, helpful  and always available but unobtrusive. The cafe which adjoins the property means you dont have to leave the poolside, but there are many options surrounding you in  legian. Also very close to beach (2 mins walk max). \n\nApartments nicely decorated too. Not a hotel, so no spa, but who needs one - there are 2 directly across the road. My #1 pick in south Bali.",

              "text": "We stayed 12 nights in these lovely apartments.  Ours was a two bedroom apartment on the first floor (202), but had a look  in other apartments too.   All lovely in their own individual way. Our apartment had two balconies, a larger one overlooking the pool and another out the back facing the neighbours.\n\nBedrooms had queen size bed, then two singles and we had an extra matress brought in as we have 3 children.  Bedrooms and living area were air-conditioned which we needed.  Living area was very spacious with TV/DVD player and sound system.  Kitchen was great to have even though we didn't make much use of it!  Bathroom was lovely too!  Drains a bit smelly sometimes, but that is Bali! Nothing some incencse won't fix!\n\nStaff were great right from check in.  Couldn't have been more friendly and helpful!  \n\nPool, not huge like a resort pool, but more than adequate for the amount of people using it.  Always clean! Our kids all loved it, so did we!\n\nLocation is perfect too, about a 300m walk up a private laneway for direct beach access or step out the front for access to Legian and all it has to offer.  Many great shops and restaurants just a stone's throw away!  Security is not an issue either with main gate and entrance through coffee shop locked after hours.\n\nEven though The Coffee Shop is a separate business I will mention it here as they do deliver food to the apartments and around the pool.  Best cafe around, most helpful and friendly staff too.  We ate a lot here! \n\nWe have previously stayed in resorts but will definitely stay here again, so much better in all ways. \n\nFeel free to ask any questions.  Hope this review is helpful.",

Loved our stay there though it did cost more than we normally pay.",

The staff were friendly, honest, accommodating and really went out of their way to ensure that our stay was memorable.  We were in a 1-bedroom apartment which was quite large, comfortable and immaculately clean.  The pool, grounds and complex were well maintained, and the security provided ensured that we felt very safe at all times.  We can't wait to get back there next year but book quickly if you want to stay here because it's in very high demand! \nLesley and Peter Boyle - Australia",

Beach Melati Apartments are in such a handy location in Legian on Jln Padma Utara (1/2 way between Jln Double Six and Jln Padma) close to restaurants, shops and spa's.  It's just a quick walk to the beach (next to Ossotel Hotel).  The whole complex is beautifully presented and very very clean.  We found it to be quiet and relaxing.  Jinae and the whole team working there were great.  We would highly recommend Beach Melati Apartments and will definately be staying again.   Thanks again - Jill & Karen",

We stayed in Sanur for the first 4 nights then to Beach Melati Apartments for 3 nights and Canggu for the last few nights. \nThe Melati was in a great location with the beach close by. We stayed in a 1 bedroom on the ground floor which walked out into the pool area. It was very large with a kitchen and large fridge. The lounge had a comfortable sofa and good size TV. \nThe mini supermarket in front of the Melati was great for buying drinks and snacks.\nThe boys organized a driver to drop us to Canggu which was great. \nI would highly recommend this place for couples and families",

Jinae and staff are absolutely amazing and go beyond to help you with anything you may need . Transfers , tour bookings , restaurant recommendations, SIM cards, laundry etc . We stayed in a one bedroom apartment which was lovely with the best aircon ever . We have been to Bali over 20 times and Beach Melati would be one of our favorites. This would be a great place to stay if it\u2019s your first time visit to Bali as sometimes it can be a little overwhelming. The Beach Melati team make you fee safe and at home . It\u2019s also great for families with 2 and three bedroom apartments. \nLocation is fantastic with heaps of restaurants at your doorstep , a great coffee shop ( mugshots ) and the beach a couple of minutes away with a quick walk down a gang .\nDo not hesitate you will love it \u2764\ufe0f",

The apt is large; the 'view' is water glimpses only (sneaky bit of water between palm fronds in the distance) so you're not going to sit on the (large) balcony to watch the ocean. Furnishings were great, beds were comfy, assort of pillows provided.\nThe only toiletries prov'd is t/paper and soap, so remember to bring yr own shampoo, tissues, etc. A small UHT milk and some tea/coffee/water is waiting for you (and, nicely, mozzie repellent) but conv stores are very close by.  \nThe kitchen is well eq'd, but there are so many restaurants to choose from within a few metres walking distance. I think that there's supposed to be a bbq on the balcony, but it wasn't there for us?\nThe air conditioning to this apt was an issue for us.  Two front bedrooms were great (think meat-locker) but main bed and living were just cool at best, kitchen was stifling. Split a/c units only and they are prob not placed well & just not coping with the large area.\n3 keys provided for access - all ext doors are key locked inc. a lead-in door to the apt.  The property door leading from an alley way has an unusual locking method of the utilisation of sliding a screwdriver through both handles to that the doors cannot be opened from outside. I'm not sure what would happen if you arrived home after 'screwdriver time'.   \nThis site has a delightful pool with deckchairs and tables/chairs. The staff are friendly and helpful!\nI would definitely stay there again if the a/c was upgraded.",

              "text": "Located in Seminyak, we always stay at this place when we visit Bali. We have grown used to the location and its relationship with the local amenities. This creates a sense of belonging. Accommodation for us is more than the building and the quality of the mattress.\n\nFor us, staying in an apartment, as opposed to a Villa, or a hotel room, is the superior choice. It gives us the independence and privacy that we enjoy. It also gives us that sense of safety that belonging to a small community can bring, temporary though that may be. The manager and staff provide friendly involvement and a hands-on approach that creates and consolidates the overall ambiance and makes you feel that this is where you want to return on your next visit to Bali.\n\nAlthough, inevitably, this is an ageing property, it enjoys excellent maintenance, as well as sensitive attention to its interior decor that creates the signature luxury look of the place. Each apartment is different, and there are one, two or three bedrooms options.  Each apartment has a kitchenette and facility to prepare and store snacks and beverages. There is only on apartment that has a full kitchen, one of two penthouses. The manager understands  the client community that has grown up around this accommodation, and will attempt to place them into apartments that they have either grown used to or that is going to be the best available match to their needs. The well maintained swimming pool and surrounds gives the place its heartbeat, and is well used by individuals and families who stay there. \n\nWithin walking distance there are breakfast restaurants and amazing dining out options, offering a range of cuisines: South American; Italian; local Indonesian; International. Within a block there is an evening restaurant with a drag floor-show that is lots of fun and to which lots of parents will also take the children.\n\nIf you need a tailor, there is one around the corner, if you need a gluten free specialist, also around the corner. Also in the neighbourhood there is an Apotik (pharmacy); 711s for drinks and snack foods; a beauty clinic; 2 medical practices and last but not list, a short block from the beach.\n\nJalan Legian, the shopping strip is a short two blocks away, and if you are inclined, you can walk to the Kuta shopping area and markets.\n\nWere there any worries: yes, rooms on the street side can be noisy, depending on what is going on with the other businesses on the street. But then if you want easy access, then you are going to share air space with all of these places.\n\nBeach Melati provides access to free WiFi. There is off street-parking if you want to hire a car, which we always do because we like to drive ourselves. There is a very reasonably priced laundry service next to the off street parking.\n\nRoom maintenance and cleaning is superior.\nSecurity is provided on a 24/7 basis.",

We went into the front of the apartments where there is Cocomart (a small supermarket type thing) which had drinks, snacks and everything you needed pretty much. The boys got us a big bottle of aqua water for $3 to put on the machine inside our apartment. This gave us hot,warm and cold water.\nThe swimming pool was always clean same as the rooms. This place is a hidden gem in the heart of Legian. There also is a money changer inside the Cocomart in the front of the apartments who are very reliable and honest.",

She was great to meet in person too.\n\nThe apartments are bloody amazing, especially for people with young families. We have twin boys (5) and baby (1), they where spacious, very clean and tidy, modern apartments. Our boys loved the pool & for me it was great, as I could relax watching them while the baby was sleeping in the room. Win win!\n\nThe staff where Excellent!!  From booking us dinner reservations, to getting us drivers, to recommending us places to go. We loved one of the staff getting his guitar out for us to have a sing-a-long too. Well done guys!\n\nThanks you for making our stay in Bali so so enjoyable. Your location is spot on.\n\nWe hope you can get back there soon \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb",

A small complex which made it a quieter place to stay and which were well maintained and very clean and cozy. Although the pool is small it was big enough to cool off and swim  in and with the beach very close by it was never over  crowded around the pool. Sun lounges could be moved to make the most of the sun. An enjoyable stay.",

Rooms are very spacious with large fridge and microwave. Just one thing is that the pool surround can be slippery and the pool a bit rough so advise that kids have non slip socks or shoes to wear in and around the pool! Enjoy your stay !!",

The staff here are the fantastic,  Aris  could not have done more to make our return stay as relaxing as ever.  The entire resort is immaculate and beautifully maintained.  Jinae is the best manager.  Nothing is too much trouble and she gets to know all of the guests.  I do not tell anyone about Beach Melati Apartments as it is too good to share.  This is my once a year home away from home and I am so appreciative of the staff that make it so enjoyable.  Can not wait to be back xxx000",

You are greeted with the views of a beautiful pool area surrounded by tropical trees and plants. Around the pool area you can relax in daybeds or sit around a table and chair setting. Surrounding this area is the three level apartments which are beautifully appointed and and presented on the outside. Once inside our apartment we were greeted with a spacious set up which was tastefully decorated. The apartment had all we needed in relation to amenities in and outside our rooms. The complex manager Jinae and her staff were very friendly and attentive to all our needs during our 15 night stay. We would highly recommended staying here for people wanting to get away from the big resort style holiday and who are wanting that special time away in a very comfortable and relaxed setting. Keep up the great work and we are looking forward to seeing you all again. Alan and Judy Greig \n\n",

We booked a 1 bedroom however I believe we were in a 2 bedroom (room 103)\nIts great having a fridge to fit in all you water and beers!\n\nThe pool is quite deep however there is a smaller size pool to the side that is best for kids.\nLoved laying around the pool. \nHowever, if you enjoy sunbaking -  note that the sun isn\u2019t always shining in the pool area due to the roof line / trees. This didn\u2019t worry us but had others lying in front of the entry to try get some rays. \n\nAffordable accommodation with polite staff with many shops and good quality restaurants out the front. \nWe will definitely be back.",

The apartments are all clean, air conditioned, beautifully decorated and comfortable. This time we stayed on the top floor apartment 301 and found it to be a little hot, as all the windows which get the afternoon sun do not have a block out blind, only bamboo which doesn't cut the heat out or the light for watching tv. We hung quilts over all of these windows to help with this problem, but syaing this it is a lovely apartment. However, this is an issue for the landlord of the apartment to sort out should they want people to rent their apartment and not the fault of the Beach Melati Apartment staff.",

Jinae and her band of merry men make you feel at home and nothing is too much trouble for them. The units are spotlessly clean and serviced daily. The pool is welcoming and clean and great to sit around while deciding where to go to eat. Plenty of restaurants in very close proximity along with any other service you may require..Beach just down access laneway. The staff and high walls make it a little hideaway and you feel quite secure in this little hidden gem. Can't wait to return! Thanks Jinae and boys for making our stay relaxing and enjoyable :)",

The kitchen was well equipped, although we never used it because there are so many eating places within a few minutes walk.  As our flight home was overnight , we were allowed to use the room until our departure, because the room was vacant the next day, which was very kind of them.",

He explained he could not carry all the bags up but you told him not to worry as you had 2 men and 4 teenage boys in your group. Yes we do take payment on check-in which is clearly advised in our booking confirmation letter. Aircon in every room of your apartment was working and so was WiFi. \nWe tried to speak to you about your teenage sons when they were found lighting fireworks and throwing them on to our neighboring family\u2019s Hindu temple but you were out shopping. I hope you wouldn\u2019t allow them to do this at a church in Australia. We did discuss it with the boys uncle who spoke to them about their disrespectful behaviour. \nWe also had to ask the boys on numerous occasions to turn their loud music down at the pool as it was disturbing other guests. Again you were out so we emailed you to bring this to your attention. \nOur apartment owners are all Australian or NZers. The guests (from South America) that you are insulting have stayed with us for many years and will continue to do so. \nOur previous reviews and our high ranking reflect what our staff and apartments are really like. We\u2019re very happy that you found other accommodation that tolerated your family\u2019s behaviour.",

We stayed in room 102 on the ground floor which is a two bedroom apartment. We were only booked in for a one bedroom apartment so the extra space was a bonus. You don\u2019t feel like you are in a hotel and it\u2019s great to have a big fridge! The pool and facilities are great, the wifi the best we\u2019ve had in Bali so far. The location is wonderful, so close to everything you need and only a 30k or so taxi to Kuta or Seminyak although most things are walking distance anyway. The staff were so lovey and friendly. They were accommodating and assisted us with a late checkout and airport transfer which was very much appreciated as we had a late flight. Thank you so much for the great stay, we truely enjoyed our time at Beach Melati. We will definitely be staying here next year and I highly recommend if visiting Legian! ",

We especially like the staff--most helpful and attentive.\nThe wifi was good 98% of the time, so no complaints there and that is important for us.  Big fridge, microwave, good size dining table and workspace, comfortable beds--and several large full-length mirrors.  This property is small--3 floors--without feeling cramped, and is half minute walk to the street and restaurants, taxis, shops, the Luna Spa right across the street with great foot massages and always busy.\nTook a look at a couple of the other apts and they look just as comfortable too.\n\nLooking forward to our next stay there!",

Close to some great restaurants and a short walk to the beach. Staff are wonderful and very friendly. Can not thank them enough. Our daughter became very sick one night and they arranged a Doctor and Nurse to come to our room within 5 minutes. We would definitely stay again. Thanks again Beach Melati Apartments \ud83c\udf34",

The aircond in our living room and one of the bedroom malfunction. It were replaced with 2units of new airconds. Thumbs up for that!\n\nThe location was excellent ie. Located at a non-busy street, eateries are nearby.",

The unit is beautiful with 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and ample room inside and also on the extensive balconies to be with your friends or spend some quiet time reading soaking up the sun. Lovely Staff who will help in any way to make your stay more comfortable. A happy place, close to shops, massage parlors, safe ATMs and other holiday makers within the complex whom you may or may not wish to associate with. We also did a cooking class at the Swiss-Belinn Hotel around the corner which was very valuable. A lovely place to stay and relax or to use as a home away from home! 10/10!",

The location is great, it's family friendly, the staff and manager are amazing and do any thing they can to make you feel like your at home. The pool is clean, the rooms are very clean and get cleaned every day and the staff worked around our sleeping baby. The apartments all have so much room and are very sound proof. We loved that you can get the staff to purchase the 15L water bottles as all the apartments have the cooler machines in them. We will be booking to stay here for all of our Bali holidays now. Thank you so much to all of the staff at the beach melati apartments for making our holiday so easy and enjoyable.",

Found it by searching reviews for the area and I am so pleased to have discovered it was right under my nose. It is a small family run establishment and all staff were a delight and happy to follow any requests and answer any questions. We had a large 2 bedroom apartment on ground level overlooking the well maintained pool and gardens. The sitting area/ lounge / kitchen area was huge. There is a little alley way alongside which leads to the beach so is in a perfect location. Nearby are lots of eateries and stalls, chemists, Warungs, spas / massage girls and Circle K for money change and limited grocery items and Bintangs. Will definitely return to stay here should we return to Legian. ",

Very easy to get taxis from front of apartments. Access to apartments is from a gang just a few metres from the road. Very private and secure. Pool area is gorgeous and maintained perfectly. It is a small complex so most days we had the area to ourselves. The best thing about the apartments is the New Zealand manager Jinae and her staff. Nothing is too difficult for them. Jinae surprised my sister with a birthday cake which was a lovely thought to help us celebrate. I have stayed in 3 different apartments in the complex and all were decorated well, clean and air conditioned.  Looking forward to returning next year.",

It was my friends birthday and we came back to a cake from the staff and the apartment done up with balloons etc, it made her day. They go that extra mile for their customers. \nThe apartment was huge and so spacious compared to a small hotel room, pricing was great and location was the best. There is a walk way directly to the beach, we ate at Zanzibar restaurant most mornings. New coffee shop on the corner called morning glory - again amazing coffee! \nA big thumbs up from me!",

Located in a fab spot close to Bintang supermarket, restaurants and good shopping but still away enough to be quieter than Kuta. The staff are friendly, courteous, willing to help in any way and just straight up beautiful people. The manager is a bright & bubbly woman from New Zealand who is so willing to help in any way she can to make your stay wonderful. We love staying here and we love visiting our friends at Beach Melati Apartments. Recommended stay!!!!",

Everything is so easy when you choose to stay at the apartments, from making the booking, the airport transfers and most importantly your time there. Jinae is awesome in helping with any bookings and the ever awesome Yuda is the best driver. I have actually had three stays in the last 6 months but am only writing this review now...sorry. On one of the previous visits we had a friend with us who turned 50 and was surprised by the staff with an amazing birthday cake, what a beautiful personal touch for a guest. On our most recent visit one week ago we had a couple with us who were experiencing Bali and the apartments for the first time. They spent the last few days after we left there and would like to pass on that they had the best experience there as first timers thanks to you guys. Please do not hesitate to make a booking, everthing is in easy walking distance, the beach, beautiful restaurants, shopping, great coffee and wonderful spa treatments.  You really couldn't want for more!  Thanks again and we will see you again soon.",

Jinae who is Australian and the owner/manager is such a lovely lady.\nWe had room 101 which was on the ground floor right next to reception. We could step out of our room into the pool. Very easy check in and check out.  There is no bar or restaurant onsite, however there are many shops and restaurants as soon as you walk out to the main street which is about a 10 second walk from the apartments. The beach is also only a 5 minute walk away.\nThe pool is great, my 4.5 year old loved the kids pool. The water pressure in the shower was amazing for Bali, best I have ever had from memory. I would definitely stay here again if heading to Legian. It's half way between Padma Street and Double 6 street. Great shopping all around. Only 12 apartments in the block over 3 stories so not big. The aircons all worked well, the full size fridge is a must and the king size bed was very comfy. Thank you Jinea and your team for a great 5 days in beautiful bali.     \n ",

              "text": "We've been to Bali A LOT, and I always do painstaking homework on accommodation before booking anything, so when I find something that lives up to expectations - I'm a very happy camper/traveller!!!\nFirstly, the position of Beach Melati is pretty good.  Definitely not beachside but with a small lane leading to the beach, it's almost as good as.  The lane, by the way, is quite narrow and dark, so not ideal if you're on a bike/moped or walking by yourself after dark!!\nThere's roughly a dozen or so apartments that all centre around the pool - ground floor and first floor - one, two and three bedrooms.  We booked a one bedroom apartment but were given a two bedroom apartment for the same price...however if we \"physically\" used the second bedroom we would be charged - but it was nice to have somewhere to throw our suitcases!!\nFirst impressions on entering the complex were pretty amazed.  The pool was lovely but not overly big considering how many people could be using it if the place was at full capacity.  There's a bit of shade happening too and not a great deal of space for sunbaking but as my husband and I are beach people, this didn't bother us in the slightest.\nWhen we walked into our apartment (ground floor) I was over the moon!  The place was HUGE.  Full lounge, bar, 4 person dining table, full kitchen and decent size bathroom that is located between the 2 bedrooms.  Our room backed onto the street and I was a little worried about late night noise or early morning but neither were a problem.\nTo be honest, we didn't see the staff very much so I can't honestly critic them but our apartment was always very clean, so no complaints there!\nBeach Melati is situated in more of the Legian district than Seminyak so we found shopping and eating out way cheaper than in the more upmarket Seminyak area...but obviously not the same calibre or wonderful choices that you have in somewhere like eat street.\nMy husband and I always hire mopeds when in Bali so getting around is never an issue for us and visiting Kuta (don't know why you would!) or Seminyak, Canggu or Ubud is easy.  If you're relying on taxi's then be prepared for lots of traffic (no matter what time of day you're travelling!!) and therefore, excruciatingly slow sometimes...always leave yourself plenty of time to get somewhere!\nI think Beach Melati is EXCEPTIONAL value for money.  I would not hesitate to stay here again and would gladly recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in this area.",

Not suitable for roudy groups, teenagers etc.  The entire place is spotless and perfectly maintained.  I will definitely stay again.

Jinae assisted me with odds and ends I needed for our daughters 21st birthday. It was a great mix of guests who all got on well. It's a lovely way to meet new friends. Melati is situated in a terrific spot. Out the back is the beach and out the front is the street with many fabulous places to eat.\nThe Beach Melati will now be our 'go to' spot and it's beginning to feel like our second home. We will return again early next year. Thanks Jinae and team!",

              "text": "If you're looking to read an interesting novel - go read a book. But if this is your first time in Bali? Or looking for great accomadation STAY HERE!! \n\nMy partner and I stayed at the most AMAZING \"Beach Melati Apartments\" last month in September. We are both in our early 30's, and were looking for something that was private, ages away from the party scene, but still central incase one of us got a sniff lol? (That he ended up doing) \nTrust me - stay here!! If you're not into noise, but want to be central to restaurants, beaches, shopping and most importantly somewhere, where you feel safe then this is it. \n\nWe flew from Christchurch, New Zealand a day after the fuel crisis had happened in Auckland Airport. 70% of flights had been cancelled, just. Our 9 hour flight turned into a 15 hour flight. Unsure of our new surroundings, and feeling jet lagged, as it was our first time visiting (don't ever tell anyone that!) we finally arrived in Bali. \nSuch a surreal feeling after all the horror stories you hear, especially going through customs - it was pleasantly calm, and all the staff were more than welcoming. As long as you don't have drugs.. If they're up your bum, you're still gonna caught. Don't do it!!\n\nThrough Beach Melati Apartments we had organised a driver who was waiting at the airport for us , with a bright yellow sign, that stuck out like dog balls, our name on the front beating every other person there, it instantly stood out.\nYuda was our driver, and has become our lifelong friend.\n\nWhen we arrived at the apartments the beautiful Jinae greeted us. She is also from New Zealand, and speaks both English and Balinese. This is a huge advantage, as she went above and beyond and more, and was able to tend to all of our needs. From organising day trips, to the dentist, concerts, or just a friend - she's one amazing lady who definitely made our trip the \"best trip of or lives\" and yes,200% returning - if you're not booked out!!",

From communication prior to arriving and service while we were there,  i couldn't fault a thing!  It is only a small complex  hidden behind high limestone walls right on Jalan Padma Utara. Everything you need is on the doorstep!  Room was very clean and as large as 2 standard hotel rooms with lovely high ceilings!  Room tidied every day but no drinking water provided but if you were staying longer there was stand for large bottle of water  ( maybe 20L.) that the staff offered to arrange for us. Pool area great and gets midday sun and then shaded the rest of the day. Always got a sun chair when needed. Got a peek at 2 bedroom apartment - huge!  \nLoved it here - will definitely be back!  ",

Apartment had comfy beds, full size fridge and a water cooler for large bottles that staff refilled for you for $3. Rooms were cleaned meticulously and when you went out with no intrusion at all. A 2 min walk down alley next to apartments and you are at the beach with great restaurants right on your doorstep. Safe money changer across the road as well as chemist, spa and laundry service. Staff were lovely especially Yuda who also provided us transport. Would definately stay again and recommend to anyone. Fantastic all round!!",

Walking distance to shops, restaurants, Circle Ks and other good restaurants.  \n\nApartments are large and spacious and beautifully equipped. 24hr staff and security makes this a hidden haven amongst the hustle and bustle of Padma Utara.  I originally booked for 3 nights and rebooked for another 3 rather than move to another hotel.\n\nI would definitely stay here again and recommend it very highly.  Good food close by at the Ossotel and across the road at One-O.",

I would recommend these apartments to any families travelling to Bali who want to stay in a great location, close to shopping, restaurants and the beach. The apartments each had a kitchenette so we able to prepare breakfast or snacks if we wanted or you can order in from the many local restaurants if you don't feel like going out. The apartments were in great condition and cleaned by the wonderful staff every day.  The staff were very helpful, we had a few problems with our safe and they were quick to assist us.\n\nThanks Beach Melati Apartments for a fantastic holiday.",

The third bedroom was twin beds, but that was ok. 2 bathrooms with the main having its own private ensuite. The only downside was 4 flights of stairs up to the second floor. It was not really arduous but one of my friends had a bad back and found it a bit challenging. The staff were wonderful and everything was clean and in good working order.\nThere is so much room in the penthouse, we felt very comfortable. The location is very handy to the beach and the shopping. Highly recommended.",

This would have been perfect except for tree loping that took place for six days nearby but this was no way the fault of the Melati Beach. Stayed in one bedroom apartment on the ground floor which suited us perfect. Would have like at least a stove top to do cooking in the apartment if we wanted. the rest of the facilities were excellent. Location is perfect, Easy access to the beach and a large selection of shops and plenty of choices for eating.\nThe staff are the best, so friendly and helpful.",

We've done the Dynasty as a family and this wins hands down. I've done the Jayakarta with mates and this easily wins.\n\nWe stayed for 3 weeks in a 3 bedroom (302) at the Beach Melati  and it was HUGE. When our eldest son went home early for work, my sister and brother-in law stayed with us and it was still huge. Calling out for someone doesn't work because they may be all the way out on the wrap around balcony. This isn't just somewhere to stay - you could live here. We had a snoop around some other rooms that were vacant and they look just as good.\n\nThe staff here are fantastic. They are all very professional, make a great personal effort and will work around you. They helped us with everything and really made all my family feel welcome. Again as a family this was good for our younger kid. \n\nIts an apartment so you feed yourself or eat out. We did breaky in the apartment some days but mostly hit the many local joints. Again, Jinae or the others will offer any advise you may need. Apart from food, the service provided covers everything else you'd get in a resort.\n\nWhen we return to Bali we will be staying here.",

Apartment 302 was where we stayed and from top to bottom it was an absolute pleasure. The amount of space in the place was fantastic, felt like we could spread out to no end and relax without ever feeling cramped, hugely spacious. The apartment is decorated with some vibrant art and furniture, a generous amount of utilities, an incredible bathroom with an amazing shower. Water cooler is a great bonus and the beds are huge and very comfortable. Top pick for the place would be the balcony - spacious and wrapping around the side of the apartment it provided an excellent space to relax and unwind with a great view straight into Legian. The apartment complex itself is beautiful. Very relaxing with a large pool in the centre, Jinae and the staff there are incredibly helpful with everything from advice, servicing the apartment, getting around, what to see or even just someone to chat to! Pro: it's super close to the beach which means going and getting a local culinary delight from my favourite vendor, Corn Man as much as humanly possible.\nWhat more can I say? You need to check this great space out for yourself when you're in Bali next. Highly recommended.",

              "text": "My wife, 2 year old son and I stayed in apartment 104 in Aug-Sep this year. Found it to be ok value for money but our apartment was definetly the most basic of the lot. As we had a long stay there (32 days) we had the whole place to our selves at one stage and got to have a look in all the apartments. All the rest are a lot nicer than the one we stayed in and are priced accordingly.\n\n The design of the complex is great and each apartment is unique however if you have small children you would want to be very careful with the gaps in the stairway railing and balcony's upstairs. The small pool was good temp and cleaned daily.\n\nThe Apartments can be hard to find and we found all the taxi's, transport guys etc will take you to the Melasti Hotel because they are not aware of the Beach Melati and there is absolutely no pernament parking out front for a car and even bikes are a hassle with every business in the vicinity choosing to park on there tiny bit of allotted space out front.The path that leads to the Beach Melati entrance is nice and private and we really enjoyed walking our son down the shaded path to the beach most mornings.\n\nAs with most places we've stayed in Bali the staff are friendly and helpful especially with our 2 year old son. The rooms are cleaned daily, other than that they leave you to do your own thing unless you need something and they are onto it straight away.\n\nIf we were coming back with a group of friends or family the 2 & 3 beroom apartments would be awesome, they really are finished off nicely and spacious however because its such a small and quiet complex we think our son will be wanting to run amok abit too much for us to stay again anytime soon!",

We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment which offered plenty of space for 2 adults and 2 teenagers. The rooms were very clean and workers and management were very friendly.",

Very happy we did,. It was a pleasure to stay there. Its easy to book on line. The manager Jinae is very profesional and friendly. The apartment has high walls surrounding ,located in the middle of Legian close to shops and restaurants, If you dont feel like going out, there are restaurants close by that will deliver to your door. My husband & I shared with my sister, We stayed on second floor 204, 2 bedroom. Rooms are tastefully decorated and spacious, cleaned everyday to a high standard . The staff were happy to please and very friendly, security 24/7.  I would not advise using the side lane at night. What more can I say but I will certainly be going back !",

Both apartments are ground floor with direct access to the pool. On the western side of the building, away from the road.\nThe staff were always friendly and helpful. Thanks Jinae, Aris & Gede. \nApartment 102 has been recently updated with all new furniture and looks great. The second bedroom has 2 single beds and is a little bit small, with no wardrobes. This apartment has air conditioning in all rooms, but no ceiling fans and the bathroom is within the main bedroom area(toilet seperate to bathroom). So may not suit couples sharing, but ok for a family.\nApartment 101 was very spacious with modern furnishings. 2nd bedroom has 2 single beds and is spacious. All rooms have ceiling fans and air conditioning. Bathroom and toilet together.\nThe pool is small compared to a resort. We still swam daily and the pool was never crowded.\nLocation is central to all the great Legian restuarants. There is currently construction around the apartments with new buildings going up. The noise was never an issue, however traffic out the front was at times congested. \nThe lane to beach is private with no traffic access for about 100 metres. It then joins another lane that has motorbike access and is very narrow, we only encountered a few bikes and they always stopped and allowed us past. At night the lane can be quite dark and we took a small torch. \nCircle K across the road was handy for drinks and food. Bintang Supermarket is not far in a taxi and you can find most grocery items there. \nEnjoyed our stay at the Beach Melati Apartments.",

Complex was not busy when we stayed. \nClose to shops ,transport, restaurants and beach access down the laneway .\nSince our last visit,  the outdoor recliners and tables and seating around pool and on our balcony is new and comfy.\nOne suggestion would be a hairdryer in room . No big deal but would be handy.\nRoom was spotless after daily clean and a haven to retreat into after a long day at beach or shopping. \nI have recommended lots of friends to stay here and all are happy to return to Beach Melati.",

The apartment itself was gorgeous and everything was in perfect working order. It was spotlessly clean when we arrived and with daily (!) housekeeping, continued to be so. The complex is in a fantastic position - a little more quiet than Kuta but only a 3 min walk down a quirky little alley to the beach. A twenty minute walk along the beach shoreline saw us at Ku DeTa and Bintang supermarket is a five minute scoot away ;)\nAll of the above leads to a great holiday and that it was. But the difference between Melati and other places I have stayed, is the staff. There was never anything at all that was a bother- all staff even humoured my 4 year old while she told them her long and convoluted stories. When my 8 month old had a relapse of his cold from the week before one of the guys jumped on his scooter and went and got him some 'Vicks' and baby panadol-he could have just given me the directions to the pharmacy but to him it was genuinely no problem.\nThe manager of the property Jinae is full of info and on top of going above and beyond is also friendly and great to have a laugh with.\n\nWe got home two days ago. I booked our next stay at Melati today. Nuff said really!",

Our recent stay was in the penthouse and I must say that the new owner has made some great changes to the spaces in the bedrooms, all now have TV's and new soft furnishings. We have recommended the apartments to many friends and family members and have not had one complaint !!\nThe beauty of the apartments is that you have a separate living space to the bedrooms and  either a balcony or veranda for those afternoon drinks.    \n\nThe location is perfect for our needs, a short walk to the beach and restaurants in one direction and not too far from Legian Street for a bit of retail therapy in the other. \nJinea and the boys are brilliant, the rooms are cleaned daily and nothing is too much trouble. \n\nIf your looking for a large resort with swim up bar, kids club and bebe guns this ISNT the place for you.\n It is a quiet oasis that makes me feel safe and secure when outside on the street its madness !",

The apartments are cool, clean (cleaned EVERY DAY!), spacious and modern.  Next time we'll try for the 3 bedroom penthouse as only having 1 x bathroom in the 2 bedroom apartment was not a huge problem it did have it's downfalls with so many ladies sharing.  The staff (Janae and team) were extremely friendly and helpful with any aspect including a loan of luggage scales to make sure our \"tonnes of shopping\" weren't going to cost us $$$ in excess luggage.  These apartments are a handy 1 minute stroll to the beach, shops and restaurants at your doorstep while feeling safe and secure.  It truly was an oasis in Legian to retreat to...try the Niksoma restaurant next door on the beach front - sensational food and great value.",

At first we were in the Penthouse Suite, and I would highly recommend this room, particularly if you had a larger group, as it is lovely, clean, big and has televisions in 3 rooms.   Although we then moved on to another room in the apartments, when it was discovered that the television in our new room didn't work properly, the management very kindly allowed us to move back to the Penthouse Suite for the remainder of our stay.  The staff we met, including the manager and also Aris, were very friendly, pleasant and helpful with everything.  One of the greatest assets about these apartments is that you can easily step out on to the street for some shopping and get a coffee at Mugshots nearby, or walk a short way to the beautiful nearby beach for a buffet breakfast or dinner.  Beach Melati Apartments is a great place to stay for easy access to shopping, restaurants and beaches.  It wasn't a quiet place at night, because our bedroom was near the streets below, but this wasn't too bad, and there is a beautiful outdoor deck so you can have dinner outside or enjoy a book.  The kids also really enjoyed swimming in the pool.",

The Apartments are decorated in modern and comtempory in design , they are clean ,fresh and I always feel I'm in my own private resort.  \nOn arrival we were greeted by a friendly staff member who welcomed us back as this trip was the third time we had stayed Beach Melati and it was great knowing that most of the staff were the same from when we were there in 2009.\nFrom the moment we booked with Tracey in Sydney until the time we checked out everything ran very smooth, nothing was a problem with the staff, we were advised that the manager had recently been admitted to hospital , but the staff were on hand to assist with anything we required. \nWe moved to our next location in Legian (Baleka Spa Resort) which is just accross the road from Beach Melati and I have to say the recent renovations have made the place 100% better since I visited someone there back in 2009.  The first room we stayed in was average, the room itself had been renovated but the bathroom had not been touched and the shower was terrible.  I quickly reported this to management and was advised that we could move after 7 days into another room.  I then made the decision that we had been spoilt at Beach Melati and our next trip, instead of moving around we are staying put at the apartments.\nI was astounded by the poor review of this place by an obvious disgruntled customer as I have never witnessed anything he is saying, but each to their own, we loved it and will be back again in September.  Cannot wait!",

It was a great base for a shopping, eating, drinking and relaxing! \nWe called apartment 301 home for the week and it was a home away from home. It was huge!\nNice and clean with aircon in every room (Not great in the first bedroom due to postions of unit) and fans in the first and second bedrooms. \nWith a full kitchen at our disposal, we took the 5 minute ride to Bingtang Supermarket and were able to stock up on water, bingtang and snacks for the afternoons spent out on our balcony.\nThe weather was nice and I swam everyday, the pool was always clean and we had it to ourselves most of the time. \nJinae and the boys are great and couldn't help us more with anything! Any questions I had were answered in a heart beat. The driver they recommend Kadek was fantastic and took us anywhere we wanted to go, as well as introduce us to different places to eat and see.\nThe Spa Inner Glow around the corner was good value and they had a sterializtion machine for mani pedi instruments!\nAll in all we had a great trip and will be coming back to Beach Melati Apartments as soon as we can!",

To qualify that, we have stayed all over Bali and Lombok over the last 20 years and in all types of accommodation but this is the first time we have walked out of somewhere costing us money. We stayed there after reading comments on trip advisor which must have been written by the owners. It is or should I say the room I stayed in was dirty, moldy, noisy, and dark. The staff clearly can't stand the management as they spoke quite horribully about them and we found the very rude ourselves. We thought the fact it was owned and run by Aussie it might be good and we were sorely mistaken. Again to qualify we know things never quite go as expected in Bali and that's part of the appeal however this left a sour taste in our mouth and would prefer to stop it happening to other unless you knew these matters where address.

              "text": "We (6 girl friends) shared apartment 301, 3 bedroom on top floor which was great. Large spacious, clean apartment with air con and everything you'd need.  Down to iPod speaker, water cooler (needed to buy big water bottle but only worked out to $2!!), Australian plug adaptors, tea towel, washing up liquid !  Air con was great, in all rooms except the main bedroom.  The ensuite to this room was massive although the bathroom was tiny in comparison but we all shared around so wasn't a problem.\n\nApartment was serviced daily with new towels if required and general tidy around and beds made so in that respect was abit like a hotel.  Would recommend Mugshots Cafe for a great coffee and ham and cheese toasted croissant in the mornings.  Just down from there is a little bar called Rickys which we went to on the first night and had the best and cheapest cocktails all holiday there !  In some places we swore there was no alcohol in them, but when you look at the local price of spirits then it wouldn't surprise me if that was the case !\n\nPick up from the airport arranged via the apartments which worked well upon arrival but going back we hailed 2 Bluebird Taxis off the street as always lots of taxis going by.\n\nWalked into Kuta via the beach road/path and that took half an hour to the hard rock cafe at a brisk pace so not too far.\n\nAll in all a good find and we would definately book again as good value too.",

              "text": "As a group of eight people including two young children, we found Beach Melati to perfectly suit our needs.  We had the three bedroom apartment on the top level (room 301) and a one bedroom apartment on the middle level (room 203).  Both rooms were very nicely fitted out, quiet and well maintained. \nThe outlook from room 301 onto surrounding trees is attractive.  This apartment is very well laid out and spacious enough for four adults and two children to spread out. The air conditioning works well.  The only downside is that it is a long climb up and down the stairs when using the pool. (The staff allowed us to use a bathroom on the ground floor to avoid the climb though).\nRoom 203 is perfectly functional for a couple.  There is no dining table inside but you can sit at a bench or at the table on the balcony to eat.\nThe pool and the area around it are small but work really well.  We very often had the pool to ourselves. The people in the rooms surrounding the pool tend to use their own seating rather than use the sun lounges. The main pool is very deep, but the adjoining smaller area is shallow which suited our 3 year old.\nThe service is exceptional, with nothing too much trouble for the manager or staff.  The apartments are cleaned throroughly each day and the communal areas are spotless.\nBeach Melati is well located if you want to stay in Legian.  Mugshot Cafe (with good western style coffee and meals) is very near and there is a number of decent restaurants/warungs that deliver to your room or to the pool for no charge.  The beach is a short walk away down a narrow lane and there are good restaurants there too.  There is also a Circle K convenience store nearby which is well stocked and has an ATM and reliable money changer.\nMy only real criticism is that the railing on the stairs and around the balconies is deficienct from a safely perspective and we had to keep a close eye on our children when they were outside.\nOverall we all thought that the accommodation was very good and would recommend it if you would rather a self contained apartment to a hotel-style experience.",

Special mention to the boys at the Coffee shop, they make the stay all the more better with there smiles and cheeky nature each morning. We have booked to stay again in a weeks time, and i have no problem at saying we will have another fantastic stay at Beach Melati.",

She went out of her way make our last week in Bali just perfect!  And the accommodation was just gorgeous!  We had the 3 bedroom apartment, and I just don't think you can beat it!  We rarely needed to use the air-con as being on the 3rd floor and with glass doors that open out onto the balcony, the breeze was beautiful almost every day.  Even at night, the apartment is cool enough (in Oct,) to not need the air-con going all night.  The staff are prompt, courteous and helpful. The beds are super comfortable and the rooms very spacious.  The walk to the beach is only short, approx. 3 mins down a little lane.  This place is a real find - and we will be back for sure!!",

The staff and Reception lady (Jinae) where all so happy to provide excellent services.  For a week I stayed in the Penthouse (3 bedroom) apartment 301.  I had the best time.  The apartment was huge and had everything and more I needed.  The decking around the apartment stretched all around and I had beautiful views.  I would highly recommend these apartments and especially apt 301.  I will be back for sure.  In fact I would love to be there all year round.  Just loved it..",

              "text": "Arriving at Melati Apartments is no fanfare affair. To be honest, it's stuck behind a cafe with a high wall around it. No reception to speak of. This could be disconcerting for travelers used to the grand (but wasteful) foyers in Bali hotels.\n\nSo that's the bad news (for those who enjoy those big empty voids at the front of the hotel).\n\nThe rest is all good. \n\nThis is very different living to your hotel style living. If you like a resort, please read this paragraph. If you like a villa, skip to the next one. The reason I do this is that I have found many people like different things in Bali. So one review doesn't fit the bill!\n\nResort lovers: you will like the communal pool. But you will LOVE the room you have to live in! We stayed in a 2bdrm apartment on the ground floor, right next to the pool. You would pay a fortune at Santika Beach Hotel (for example), for this privilege, and it would be just a room. With this, you get a kitchen, lounge room, dining room and separate bedrooms.\n\nif you have children, it is perfect, although if your children are rowdy, I would not recommend it. However, if your children understand the words \"no bombs\" and \"keep it down a tad\", they will be just fine!\n\nWe travel here on business, so for us, it was perfect. Plenty of room to work, wife (you need to buy it, but it's reliable, 155.000 / 24 hours).  It's serviced daily and the aforementioned cafe out the front probably does the best coffee in Bali. They also will let you run a tab. Their beer is reasonably priced, food is fresh and it's run by Aussies. Hats off to them!\n\nFor the villa lover:  you may not like the lack of privacy, but for value for money, it is much cheaper and just as spacious.\n\nWe love Villa Coco for its seclusion, but when they were booked out (I shouldn't have posted such a glowing review!!!), we booked in here instead. This is different to anything we have ever stayed at, but we give it thumbs up. \n\nThis is so worth a try. If you stay in Bali a lot, a week out of your life won't kill you. When you are inside your apartment, it is quiet. Sleep quality is perfect, no noise at night, dark rooms.\n\nFor those with kids: get a second story apartment, or top floor. One, for safety. Two, because you can effectively 'end' pool time by going upstairs. Much more difficult if it is right their in front of them!\n\nAs a seasoned Bali traveler, (around 50 times) I have no hesitation recommending this property. It IS different, but I think it has more pluses than minuses. It beats Santika Beach hands down, and is also cheaper!!!!\n\nFeel free to contact me with any specific questions.\n\nClare",

Het ligt op 100 meter van het strand met een eigen prive toegangs pad.\n\nHet ligt aan het 'Double 6' strand, wat een bekend strand in Seminyak is. Hier zijn veel goede restaurants en de golfen zijn ook goed om te surfen.\n\nHet personeel is erg aardig en komt elke dag schoonmaken en handoeken verwisselen.\n\nIk kom er graag weer terug.",
