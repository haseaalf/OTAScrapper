Kamarnya bersih, penataan furniture yg pas membuat kesan rumah terbuka dan rapi.\nJarak ke pantai cuma 5 menit dr hotel, dng masyarakat serta turis asing yg ramah membuat kita santai dalam menikmati suasana pantai.\nTerima kasih atas pelayanan yg diberikan hotel Kirana, kami pasti balik kembali ke sini bila berlibur ke Bali.

              "text": "We stayed here as a couple for three nights as part of a two week trip in Bali. Our room type was Deluxe and we requested a high floor when booking which was accommodated. The room was large with a big balcony looking over the pool / roofs and sea beyond. Rooms are fairly basic but have everything you need. There are three set menus to choose from for breakfast all including tea, coffee and things like fruit, eggs, pancakes, bread, pastries etc. The pool area is fairly compact but clean and was rarely busy as mostly people are out and about and just using it for a dip to cool off before or after their day. The winner for us was the location, only a 5 minute walk down to the beach and set among some of the best shops / restaurants / cafes / spas Canggu has to offer.. yet still set back from the road looking out over peaceful mini rice field. Yes, there is also some construction / waste land around / visible from the hotel but it\u2019s a developing resort so that is completely to be expected. Overall given the price, I would recommend the Kirana to any one looking for a comfortable and well located base from which to enjoy Canggu.",

The breakfasts which were included were massive with lots of choice and always delivered with a smile from staff.

On a hot day it was nice to come back and relax in the quiet. Wifi is also really strong.",

I found a great price on the Penthouse so thought 'why not'.\nWhat a great find. Heaps of room, bed with drapes and huge, TV on the wall and a large bathroom. It also had a separate lounge and dining area with a full size fridge - everything you need. The penthouse has its own private pool and that was a treat. No-one can see in so it really was tranquil. The staff were great and the breakfasts were good. It's quiet, secluded and well worth it. Wed will be back. Only two slight negatives. The pool could have been cleaner and we had to ask for toilet paper - but thats it.",

The spa was amazing (seriously) and the massages were even better. The front desk also helped book our transportation to nusa islands within 10minutes of check in. The pool area is pretty and the hotel makes you feel relaxed. Highly recommended for a laid back vibe in a quiet setting. ",

The suite I reserved through Hotels.com was beyond my expectations, quite spacious, clean and comfortable. Our suite was privately situated away from guest traffic. The included breakfast offered a wide assortment of choices from local Balinese to western options and all were excellently prepared and presented. The surrounding neighborhood offers countless dining options, vegan eateries, bars, spas and shopping just steps away and the beach is a short 10 minute stroll. The hotel's spa was one of the best we've ever experienced, be sure to ask for Nuri. She's been referred by many on Trip Advisor for good reason. The pool in front of our suite gave a calming effect even while the hotel was undergoing some renovations at the time and drilling and jackhammering could be heard during the daylight hours along with construction next door of a new structure adding to the noise. The gym was inoperable. equipment broken, missing components, generally unusable. The rooftop landing offered 360 degree views of Canggu and the ocean. It served as my early morning launchpad for my Mavic Pro.\n\nCanggu has many ex-pats from Australia and is a young and happening little seaside town. I can definitely recommend The Kirana Hotel to friends and family and would return should my travels takes me back again one day.",

              "text": "We booked into the Kirana because we couldnt get a room at the Aston Canggu. We were pleasantly surprised as the check in was good and the staff welcoming. We chose a deluxe ocean view which was reasonably priced and included breakfast. The room was large and well finished - good quality and the bathroom was fantastic - two basins, the only hotel to have two basins in our entire Bali trip. The view was nice - not much of an ocean view but still nice. The breakfasts were wonderful and while not buffet style the food was very good and plentiful with lots of options - well done. NOW the less than positive - the door on the balcony would not lock. The gym was closed and there was construction activity but thats ok. We asked for a DVD player in the room and were told it would be $5 a day. I reluctantly agreed because other hotels provided players for free - but at least they also supplied a heap of dvd's to watch. On check out I left my wife with the credit card and she checked out for both of us. About three hours later I got a call from the hotel at our new hotel. They informed me that they had forgotten to charge my wife for the DVD player and they would be coming down to the new hotel to ask for the money. Then they told me it was $5USD not AUD. So this made 50,000 rph about 75,000 rph. Now I know that's not much money but it was the principle. I gave them 50,000 when they eventually turned up. Not a pleasant end to the hotel stay but otherwise the hotel was good.",

The website does not reflect the hotel as of today which is a bit run down and in need of some maintenance. We had no hot water for 3 days and had to ask a couple of times for it to be fixed. The gym is pretty poor and the treadmill is under maintenance. We were in the villa room which is spacious but in need of a coat of paint and removal of mould on the ceiling. On the plus side, staff friendly and the villa pool was nice and a very short walk to the beach. The spa which is lovely has been the saving point. We were in Bali in June and this hotel does not compare to other hotels with the same rating. Unfortunately I would not recommend. ",

It also is surrounded by many good shops and affordable cafes with amazing food. The rooms are clean and well sized with a balcony that looks onto the pool. The best thing about this place however is the staff. They are very friendly and always trying to help you with whatever you need. \n\nBicycles are also available for free and an excellent way to get around Canggu. \n\nLastly, check out is a breeze with a 12pm check out and luggage storage for free. Since our flight was late in the evening they asked us would we want a shower before a flight so they opened another room for us. Airport shuttle is only 250k which is a big bonus!",

Breakfast was also very good, great choice on the menu. The girls at reception were very friendly and organised everything from motorbike hire, taxis and massages. Nothing was too much effort for them.\n\nI would definitely stay at the Kirana again. Excellent hotel.",

Don't bother with the gym, the rooftop bar is crude, avoid the in-house restaurant in favour of dozens of excellent options on the main street.\n- lacks the vibe and friendliness you expect in Bali",

Great location, just couple mins away from Batu Balong Beach, lots of restaurants nearby.  \"The practice\" is just across the street if you like yoga.  We book Kirana Suite, the room is spacious with a nice living room and big bedroom and nice balcony with swimming pool & rice field view. The room rate is much lower than I expected.  The only thing that needs improvement is  bathroom. The water drains slowly and water stagnantion outside the shower room.",

We had some concerns prior to arrival due to our flight being delayed, but everything turned out just great and we where overwhelmed by the great staff and the good standard of customer service.\nIf we had any requests or questions, the staff where always there to help us :)\n\nGreat location, just a couple of minutes walk to the beach, plenty of restaurants just outside the hotel area.\nThe rooms are modern and spacious, housekeeping is offered every day. Nice pool area! The only thing that I wasn't completely happy with, was the standard of the bathrooms. Smelly drain and tiles not being properly cleaned, but everything works with a pair of flipflops! Haha.\n\nKeep in mind that Canggu does not have a beach for swimming. Surfing only! We did not dare to try surfing as firsttimers as the waves where too big.\n\nI would absolutely recommend Kirana, we had a great stay!",

We had a good view to the ocean..and able to check the surf from the balcony.\nThe girls in the Kanaya spa excellent doing the treatments I had being a facial, massage and manicure.The complimentary foot massages were a great way to get you in a Bali frame of mind.\nBatu Bolong surf was consistent the whole time we were there..a bit busy sometimes but enough waves for everyone.\nIf you are looking for a quiet  afternoon beer or Mojito and watching the surf at sunset the Sandbar is the place..we went there every afternoon.\nKirana is exremely good value for money and we highly recommend it!\nTrevor & Cathy from Australia \n\n",

              "text": "This resort is only a 5 min walk from Batu Balong Beach which is excellent for anyone who's down for surfing or hanging out at the trendy spots Old Mans and The Lawn. We originally had reservations for the Frii Echo Beach but immediately didn't like it so we switched to The Kirana. We stayed in The Penthouse and it was huge! Full sized fridge, large comfy bed, and a shower and a bathtub....plenty of room! The air conditioning is annoyingly loud in the bedroom so I hope you can sleep through lots of noise. We did so it didn't bother us. The penthouse had its own swimming pool and I have included the photo. That was amazing. Breakfast is very good. We got Mei Goreng everyday of the stay because it was so good. It comes with fried bananas which is even better! The last day of our stay, they didn't have any bananas because their supplier never came. That's the only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars. Other than that, you'll enjoy your stay here away from Kuta and Seminyak's awful Vegas like streets. ",

I actually think I remember this hotel being the one that I fell in love with their pillows for oddly enough ha ha.

The swimming pool however is not great as there are rooms adjacent which seem to have  a monopoly on the beds. We were also unhappy that we organised a taxi to a wedding we were attending and requested a return trip. However when we arrived at the wedding the driver told us he couldnt come back for us. A word on Changgu - dont go if you are not a surfer and over 35. There is nothing to do and the beach is quite simply awful. Internet access could also be better",

Rooms are a decent size with good air con and a good bathroom and shower - adequate for the price we paid. The pool is nice to cool off in and there is a set of sunbeds down each side of the pool area but only half get the sun at any one time. We felt the breakfast was a little disappointing in terms of flavour and quality so would suggest going for the more local options rather than Western style.\n\nWe had a Balinese massage included in our room rate and it was excellent! Lovely spa staff and nice facilities. ",

I admit I wasn't super fussy about my booking but the Kirana looked good, great location just walking distance from Old Man's surf spot and fabulous restaurants. All of that proved true and the location is wonderful with all the staff generally friendly and helpful. \n\nTwo pretty annoying issues in that the taxi pick up was 30 minutes late the hotel having sent him to international arrivals when I was at domestic terminal and then just blamed the airline. Pretty miserable when I was on a late evening flight. \n\nSecondly I went for my spa appointment only to be told bad luck as staff did not come to work.\n\nOverall no one seemed very interested in fixing the issues or my inconvenience.\n\nLike I said, great location, good value for money and a good breakfast included but the hotel overall could show more attention to detail and / or be more solution orientated.\n\n",

              "text": "Having read all these amazing reviews and seeing the promising photos everywhere I decided to stay at one of Kirana's Deluxe rooms. Wrong choice. My experience in bullet points:\n\n- The staff are all lovely, smiley and try their best but not trained or properly managed.  \n- The location is perfect if you want to walk to Oldmans or BatuBolong beach.   \n- The building needs a serious maintenance update. The walls, the floors, the wood, show signs of deterioration and no proper maintenance. \n- The rooms are not \"Deluxe\" in the slightest and need an urgent make over. There's humidity. A problem pervasive in Bali but in other places is kept under control. \n- The gym was an afterthought and shouldn't be called a gym. A tiny glass box that can get very hot, very outdated machines. \n- This is a budget hotel, but still I found it expensive for the experience it offers.",

They were quite friendly but could be a bit rude at times. For example, when asked if we took anything from the mini bar and I honestly answered \"no\", the receptionist challenged that I had taken 2 x 750ml bottles of water which I had purchased in a local shop.  \nThey kindly offer a free 15 minute foot massage as a thank you for booking with them. However, this was not possible to have due their spa closing early. \nThe music played at the pool was not to my taste either. \nThe breakfast was good however and the hotel and pool are clean. The bed was also very comfortable and the air con works well.\nWe wouldn't stay here again though. ",

There are 3 storeys, 1 room on the first and 3 huge rooms on the 2nd. 3rd being rooftop. Every room comes with a bathroom and 1 bedroom comes with both indoor and outdoor shower. Have a look at my photo and u will see how big the indoor bathroom is, as big as the room itself. One feedback would be the faulty heater that resulted in lack of hot water in 3 out of 4 rooms.... All toiletries are provided and replenished daily. Housekeeping is excellent and the service is FANTASTIC. Every staff I met is polite and actually speak and understood English! \n\nThe most impressive thing I would say is the breakfast. Once I asked for just 1 banana (not in the breakfast menu) as I was heading out, they actually sliced and served the banana into a beautiful banana platter with coconut cream on the side. I FEEL SO BAD eating it because it was SO PRETTY! \n",

              "text": "I chose this hotel first because of the positive reviews here on TripAdvisor and second because I saw that there is a gym, as I like to train even when on holidays. Regrettably the reality did not meet my expectations. \n\nLet me first start with the pros:\nLike everyone said it already, location-wise, it is one of the best in Canggu, putting you close to a selection of restaurants, bars and cafes, some of them which play live bands making the area a very lively one and fun. About 5min walk you have a seemingly very popular beach amongst the surfers enthusiast and about 15-20 drive you are in Seminiake square, the shopping heaven of the area, so they say. The hotel conveniently provides a free shuttle service that goes to Seminiake three times a day but for drop-offs only. \n\nThe staff, like most Balinese, is very friendly and ready to satisfy one's requests. The breakfast is a la carte with three choices: American, continental and Balinese. Everything else was ok. Just ok, really, for my standards and expectations. \n\nNow to some cons: the hotel itself is in need of some renovation work. If this is a 4 star, I would think a 3 star must be really horrible. The bathroom was a disaster. There was a bad smell coming up from the shower drain which forced us to keep the bathroom door always closed to prevent the smell from coming into the room. \n\nThe gym was another disappointment. It should simply be closed down and never be advertised. Those machines, not only seem to be some leftovers from the 2nd world war, they can be dangerous for anyone using them, for the condition they are in. If this facility is not highly requested and thus not worthy of modernizing it, they are better off closing it down altogether than to advertiser something that is more harmful than useful. In addition, this gym can only be used from 9am and not earlier as there is a bedroom underneath the gym, which the noise might disturb patrons still sleeping at an earlier time. ",

You could hear that the hotel tried to ask them quiet down because the music would stop for 10 minutes and then start again. This lasted until 3am\n\nIf you decide to book the hotel which is beautiful, be sure to ask for a room that does not face the pool as it seems to be a gathering place late at night. \n\nNot worth the money as there are many other place nearby.",

We had a room facing the sea, that then got pounded by wind and rain all night for 3 nights, doors banging in the frames, and then water actually coming in under the door into the hotel room so we put towels down as we were worried about electrics. The ceiling light above the bed then also began leaking right on my head, meaning we both had to sleep on one side of the bed to avoid being dripped on (there is no couch option). The weather is not the hotel's fault, however, it was not a good experience hence my rating of 2 out of 5.\nWe did ask to change rooms but the only rooms available all faced the same direction and would have the same issue so we didn't bother.\nWe never used the pool as all rooms face the pool (looking down on it) which meant it felt a bit weird/public.\nBreakfast, we tried once then ate at local cafe's which offer a larger more enjoyable range. We never used the spa or restaurant for other meals.\nStaff are friendly and pleasant enough, and it is close walking distance to the beach if you are a solid surfer.",

Great restaurants & cafes nearby. \n\nThank you for an enjoyable stay, we will probably be back before you know it. \n\nA tip for other travellers - do NOT use the money changer over the road, one of them tried to swindle us out of 1 million rupiah, he put up no argument when we marched back over & demanded our money back as he knew he was in the wrong...

I arrived to find that my bed was wet - I assumed urinated in but it may not have been urine - no one could confirm. Sheets were \"clean\" but upon closer inspection mattress and linen were sodden. Room service were quick to attend to this by changing the mattress but wiped up the bed base and floor with a towel - no disinfectant and couldn't really explain how this would have happened in the first place. Also sink blocked in bathroom and plug malfunctioned. Spa treatment decidedly average. However the staff were friendly and once we had explained our dissatisfaction we were eventually given a free massage and sincere apology (couldn't help but think that this should have been offered rather than asked for). Breakfasts were great. Pool lovely. Great location.",

Canggu is definitely more chilled out and less congested than Seminyak! There's loads of restaurants within walking distance to the hotel. The hotel itself is nicely decorated and the service is great. The breakfast is of champions with choices of American, continental and Indonesian. They give you lots of food! The pool is good, although the loungers are few and are right outside people's room which might be a bit awkward in the beginning but you get used to it. Our in room safe was having issues but they fixed it very quickly! The staff are great and always ready to help with anything. Would stay here again for sure due to its location and service. Only thing is the hotel needs a bit of a revamp as the shower leaked a bit and the towels provided were a bit frayed and old. Not really a deal breaker, but just something that would make this a 5/5 from me. Good value for money! ",

The suite was huge , well decorated and exceptionally clean. The bed was very comfortable. The breakfast was a choice of three but it was very delicious. We dined few times as well and found the food to be delicious at a great price. The hotel is close to the beach just a few minute walk, with the beach being non touristy. The spa in the hotel was exceptional with incredibly low prices. The hotel itself is a bit out from the main Kuta/Legian area but there are shuttle buses free of charge going from the hotel. Personally i preferred the Canggu area to the real touristy Kuta area. We also took numerous tours from the hotel which were great value for money. We would defo stay here again when coming back to Bali.",

We loved the pool, gym and spa here was a great way to spend a rainy day. The gym was pretty hot and the equipment wasn't the best but it was nice to have a bit of work out while away. \n\nOverall was excellent, rooms were comfortable and staff was friendly.",

The staffs said it was common during rainy season.\n\nYou need to allocate at least 15 minutes of your time for breakfast, as you need to order your breakfast first (not breakfast buffet). It wont take too long, like 5-8 minutes for your breakfast to be ready. Since the breakfast was good (I order egg benedict), I considered it was worth to wait for (except for the coffee which is not so good).\n\nThere are a lot of food close by the hotel and some shop for window shopping. Overall, I like this hotel.",

              "text": "Overall the Kirana was a very clean and pleasant hotel to stay at. The restaurant food was very good and we had dinner there twice. Staff a very friendly , helpful and efficient. In terms of location, it sits roughly in the middle between beach and Canggu hub, where all the cafes and shops are.\nThe room was good and had everything one would need. Unfortunately the balcony was very small which only allowed for one person to sit and enjoy the sunset. \nTrying to get a sun lounger at the pool was also tricky as they are directly in front of other guest rooms and it just doesn't feel right lying in front of someones bedroom window. There is a roof terrace but unfortunately un used. It has some great views. This is where the swimming pool should have been placed.\nWe took one swim in the pool and I regretted it the next day. Our swim-ware were reeking of an odour I cannot describe. Clearly the pool water had not been cleaned for a long long time and after realising this, we could actually see that the colour of tiles were blue but the water was murky green. Upon this discovery we noticed there never was  a pump sound, so no circulation, cleaning and filtration. This really put us off.\nA real pity.",

Not very impressed with the pool  , not very big & not many sun lounges & the chairs that were in the sun were right outside other people's rooms & they left there belongings there so you couldn't sit anyway . There were three chairs available but they were in the shade & we're practically in the restaurant . Hotel in a good location for surfers , close to old mans . Close to some good restaurants . We did discover a public pool which was cheap & a bit like a water park . Our room looked a bit old . Mould in the bathroom & a window that looked into the bedroom from the shower with s blind that didn't cover it properly so not much privacy as I was sharing with friends . Hotel rooms needs a makeover . But the bed & pillows were really comfortable . Overall an ok hotel , they do have villas which probably would be nice . ",

If you are wanting to get away from the hustle and bustle off Kuta this is the place for you. \n\nNegative \nThe option of the shuttle bus to Seminyak was not offered when required. The use of free push bikes would have been nice if there was more than one. Friends had to cancel last minute due to health reasons and was told that they would be refund part of their money but this never happened. \nThanks Matt",

Short walk to batu bolong beach, amazing beach with so much going on.. then another short walk to echo beach a consistent surf spot, also close walk to some really nice bars and restaurants! \nWe stayed in a double room with and ocean view and it was really good. Massive comfy bed and such a clean hotel, house keeping do an excellent job daily keeping rooms clean. Included breakfast is very nice but can become a little bit repetitive as there is only a few options. \nThe staff throughout the whole hotel are very friendly and helpful, and always willing to help with anything. \nAll in all a great experience and would recommend to anyone, if you are looking to chill out, surf and eat great food around canggu then kirana is defiantly a good choice\n",

Front desk trainee was lovely but her male superior was unfriendly and unwelcoming. I was booked in a lead in category which was basic; linen stained, bathroom door knob fallen off, towels off color, dodgy tiling, shower head corroded, underneath bed full of dust and rubbish, lumpy Mattrass. The property isn't advertised as a party hotel but in my 2 days there was quite rowdy with drunk people by the tiny pool (which all the rooms surround) and also room parties after midnight. Canggu is an amazing area and this hotel location is fantastic, I just think they need to invest some money into making it better otherwise sadly they will lose business!",

Btw, the spa was very good and is very cheap for its facility and the quality of the products they used. Wish the spa/massage could start earlier... otherwise I would do it every morning.",

The pool area is a little small though and made it difficult to find seating around it most days. The rooms are rather new looking and modern. Air con worked well. \n\nIt's nothing fancy but you won't be spending much time lounging at the hotel anyway in Canggu!",

Never had issue with security of belongings (room safe also provided) and staff were all really friendly with good English.\nBed was comfortable with a selection of pillows - AC was nice and cool. Spacious room with a balcony and great view of the ocean.\nRoof top also has some bean bags and panoramic views to lax out with in the sun.\n\nRestaurant:\nOn the ground level next to the pool. Breakfast was complimentary with the room and very generous. Lunch/dinner meals were also pretty tasty as long as you keep to local themed meals (rice/curry). Only had one desert and it was very average. Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e that was more like a runny custard - no crispy layer at all, but to be fair they apologised and offered a replacement. \nJust didn't understand the dish. \nCoffee was fantastic. Every time. Loved the coffee in Bali.\n\nThey also have a spa/professional therapeutic massage on the 3rd floor. Brilliant\n$10 for 60 mins is just great value. Sore muscles from surfing in the morning were gone by afternoon.\n\nLocation is really convenient as well. Takes 5 minutes to walk to the beach (maybe less but there's no rush)\nThere are multiple cafes, shops, bars and specialty stores all within a five minute stroll distance.\nRoad is busy with tourists on scooters but it's like 3m wide so no issues walking.\n\nATM down near the beach for getting local currency. \n\nOld Mans restaurant/sports bar on the beach has free WiFi and good food, cheap beer and always loaded with tourists.\n\nCost $35 dollars for a taxi from the airport.\n\nCheck out is early 10am, so if you're on a late night flight I recommend checking into the Novotel Airport hotel for the 10 hours or so from when you check out. Costs around $50 but much more comfortable than sleeping on the floor at the airport and chances are you'll spend that amount at the airport anyway on food and what not while you're waiting",

We requested a taxi and provided the complete address from Google maps for our destination and the receptionist read the complete address through a walkie talkie and the person on the other end replied with the price of 180,000 idr. Once driving the driver changed the price to 400,000 idr!!!!! \n\nAnd when we called the hotel while on the road to let them know they stood by the driver and would not honor the price they have.   They said we never told them it was South kuta, just kuta. But we showed them the hotel address on Google maps and they read the entire address, only leaving the zip code out. We never read the address out loud,  when they said where do you want to go we showed it on the phone.  \n\nThe fact that the hotel wouldn't even bother to call the driver to sort it out is terrible customer service and to say the driver can charge 400,000 if he wants to even though they knew the charge is 180,000 is unacceptable.  \n\nWhen i said i will make sure i write this on tripadvisor as a fair warning to other guests the reply was \"go ahead\". So, don't take their taxis unless you are ready to pay over double the fees. \n\n fyi, the taxi from that same destination to this hotel cost 138,000 earlier in the day.   180,000 seemed fair enough.  400,000? Absurd. I hope this is not a common practice at this hotel and hope management is aware of this and addresses it immediately.",

Really spacious, a smart tv and nice and big bathrooms. The hotel offers free bike usage, which is perfect for going to the beach to surf. Breakfast is really good with a lot of choice (recommend eggs Benedict) We would definitely come bakc here again. Its the best of canggu, we stayed in 2 other places. ",

It had a spacious bedroom with a king bed and our son slept in the separate living area on a rollaway bed.  Both rooms had a tv so it was perfect to be able to relax in separate rooms but be together.  The breakfast was great value - there were 2 choices of american and continental breakfast - and room service is 24 hours.  We really loved the location - Canggu is very spread out but we loved this street as it was a short walk to the beach and lots of great cafes and restaurants.  My only grip would be that the pool area is too small.",

The difference a year makes is amazing, the wooden pool deck and restaurant floor has lots of loose boards with nail heads poking up so be careful with those bare feet people. There is a lot of building going on around the area, but unless you're overly sensitive the noise is only slightly audible. Lots of new shops and restaurants such as Old Mans, Deus Ex Machinas, Monggos etc all a short walk away, even a barber shop (Dirty Sanchez), across the road, as well as lots of smaller restos and warungs. \nThe food in the hotel restaurant is still ok, although apart from breakfast we only ate there once\nThe room was clean, the aircon great especially after a day in the sun and the fridge kept the drinks icy cold\ud83d\udc4d\nThe staff are very friendly  and do their best to help you although some found language barrier a problem with the cleaning staff we didn't. Be patient people, they have to cope with probably 10 different languages a day.\nThe pool was always clean and cool, and with the aircon was also a great relief from the heat of the day.\nAll in all we still love coming here but like most of Bali it's becoming overly crowded, almost a mini Legian but without the street hawking. \nI would have given the hotel 4/5 stars but for all the loose boards and nail heads. I think the price is ok, but you can get some great deals if you look around. We will stay here again.",

We arrived all relaxed and in a good mood after a visit to Ubud. This quickly changed . . .\n\nWe requested a room for three (two adults and a teenager). We were advised the deluxe room could accommodate three. We paid. When we got up to the room there was only a double bed, so sleeping room for two only. \n\nWe went back down to reception and queried the lack of a third bed, only to be told we could pay extra for an extra bed.\n\nWe told the guy on reception that he had just sold us a room for three that only slept two. \n\nAfter an hour of waiting we ended up in a standard room with an extra bed - but we still paid the price for the deluxe room. They were unwilling to reduce the price despite the fact that we ended up with a much smaller room than what we had paid for.\n\nSo a word of warning . . . they'll try to sell you the most expensive room irrespective of how many you're looking to accommodate. Then they'll charge you for extra beds . . .\n\nBut that's not all. When we were there they were draining the pseudo rice fields in the hotel garden. We know Bali can smell, but it was disgusting. There were also loads of mosquitos due to the standing water.\n\nThe stink of the water being drained out of the rice fields was only the start, though.\n\nIn our room the smell was even worse - the putrid smell of mould. \n\nThe bed (mattress and sheets) were also damp. It was really borderline to sleep in the damp and smelly bed.  \n\nThey probably do clean now and then, but our room was dirty as  . . . stains on the bed sheets, mould in the shower. You might expect this in cheaper hotels, but not at this price.\n\nFor a fairly new hotel, things were falling apart all over the place. Some of the faults were dangerous. You wouldn't want to be here with a small kid.\n\nDo yourself a big favour and steer well clear of the crappy Kirana.There are much better places in Canggu. \n\nIf you book the Kirana be aware it could ruin you holiday. It's a stinky, dirty, expensive hole that's made to look like a designer hotel.",

The air conditioning leaked all over our stuff, the ceiling of the bathroom leaked water, the sheets smelled of body odour, the bathroom flooded with water every time you took a shower, the housekeeping would knock on our door at 10pm (and continue to do so after we asked them not to) and the staff were so unhelpful. \n\nTo top it off, when we left, the staff accused us of stealing a glass from the room, and would not let us leave. Finally after we had to say many times we did not take the glass, they reluctantly let us leave.\n\nThe only good thing was the location, but we would never stay here again. The price per night is relatively high compared to other Canggu hotels but next time we will book somewhere cheaper where at the least the staff are nicer and basic cleanliness standards are met. \n\nDo not stay here.",

All new , stylish, comfortable, beautiful and simple at the same time. Breakfasts good and generous. Staff - friendly. In a walking distance to a great surfing spot and not far from the shopping centre, where a free shuttle can take you. For me it's a perfect place for a surfer , who enjoys comfort.",

When I wanted to see the ocean view room, all the staff did was took us one step higher on the SAME side of the hotel and asked us to look left and TRY TO SEE THE OCEAN. \n\nThe bathrooms smelled. When we asked for the toothbrush, they said they usually don't give those for \"the kirana room\", and the iron was only available upon request. \n\nThe breakfast was very disappointing. It was NOT a buffet. It was alacarte based on your order. It felt like the staff were more narrow-minded than helpful. \n\nOVERALL BAD EXPERIENCE. Never going there again.",

Very convenient. \n\nService-wise also typical of Indonesia, polite and gracious. The only downside to me is that the shower area could use better maintenance with mould already growing in the see through mirror area. \n\nNote: There's currently maintenance going on in front of hotel so it's not hard to overshoot the hotel at night. \n\nNote: Local taxi cartel in this area (like many other areas in Bali) means you can't use apps like Go Jek or Uber. However, The Kirana can make ride arrangement at the fixed cost similar to that of a metered Bali Taxi (local Bluebird brand).",

Batu Bolong is a friendly neighbourhood surrounded by friendly laid-back people with peculiar taste. The Kirana is one of the place where you can bring your family or group of friends to stay and make it your home in the middle of the eclectic Canggu. We were welcomed by friendly front officers and tasty drinks at start. Our room was decent, really well-cleaned, complete with big tv and peaceful scenery towards the paddy fields. A little defect was the wash basin wasn't work really well and shower sink was kind of smelly. \nChoice of breakfast were really in vary and delicious. On my next visit to Bali, I will definitely stay here again.",

              "text": "Stayed 2 nights in The Kirana June 17-19 in room 302, deluxe ocean view room, top floor (3 storey building). \n\nThe hotel driver picked me up after an evening arrival at DPS airport, including waiting for me whilst I stood at the baggage carousel for 1.5hrs. I was charge 340k IDR for the trip, slightly more than a taxi from the airport, but with the convenience of not having to queue for a taxi ticket, or bargaining for a price when the ticket desk is closed at night.\n\nThe rooms are bigger than their standard rooms, probably bigger than international room standards, but average size for Bali.\n\nAircon (individual split system) was very cold (essential in Bali) but dripped on the floor, I put a towel underneath to stop the \"splat\" noise.\n\n2 x 330ml bottles of water are supplied each day and you can buy bottles from the mini bar, or if you have legs, go to the little shop across the road for half the price.\n\nThe hotel is 30 second walk from The Practice, an awesome new yoga studio in Canggu, run by Octavio.  There is a apotek (chemist) nearby and some very good cafes and restaurants. (try Betelnut)\n\nBreakfast at the hotel was pretty ordinary, my omelet on the first day was undercooked and on the second day the chicken sausage was cold.  The tomato and potato were good.\n\nThe pool rooms are EXTREMELY close to the pool, great if that's what you want, but be aware you will have restricted privacy.\n\nThe bar. pool and restaurant are all on the ground floor, and there are 3 storeys of rooms above that.\n\nMy room (top floor) had no traditional Bali sewerage smell, perhaps lower down it does.  Wifi was excellent, I think have a router on each floor, password is the same, just choose the one with best signal.\n\nBathroom was nice when it was dry but water leaked out the shower door and ran over the floor towards the toilet which was kind of unpleasant.\n\nTotally recommend for location to The Practice and also to Canggu beach, just a short walk away.  I would call it a 4 star boutique hotel.\n\nWould return again for the right price, but at $80-90 a night I might check the competition.",

              "text": "Lovely little hotel with awesome staff. \nBooked a pool access room which was lovely. Room was clean and nice with strong wifi signal , strong air con and loads of cable channels to surf.\n\n Toilet was huge with a nice bath tub as well as a standing shower. However do let the shower run for a few mins before going in as it does take sometime to heat up as well as to get rid of the sewage stench that does disappear shortly after.\n\nThere are not enough deck chairs to go around cos the pool is small. So don't be surprise to see people lying on sunbeds right outside your room. You don't get your own beds just because you book pool access. Pool is also more suited for soaking then swimming laps . The pool water also tends to overflow onto the sundecks especially when someone  attempt to swim in there , so don't leave your shoes outside your door unless you want them wet. \n\nIt can also be noisy as people talk and splash about the pool in the morning . The pool is literally 5 steps away from your door . So if you are a light sleeper , it's better that you take rooms that are higher up the floors .\n\nBreakfast is a treat with so many choices to choose from the menu. Service staffers are simply awesome .\n\nKirana's location is also convenient . \nDown the road they are like 10-15mins walk  away from OLd Mans, Canggu beach and Echo beach. Along the way there you will find mini mart and local warong/eateries for cheap eats. \n\nUp the road from Kirana is a stretch of more upscale cafes ,boutiques , massage spas and restaurants . So try the food at Little Flinders which serves good food and decent drinks . It's not very cheap and neither is it very expensive . For loca warong do try the one right beside the hotel . Cheap and good. \n\nFor massage ,head to Gold Dust Spa and try their stress buster massage while seated in a chair. It's really good . \n\nOverall will definitely come back to Kirana again in the future and will recommend to friends . ",

The ground is spacious compared to other hotels around. The upstairs rooms have a nice view to the ocean. If you prefer doing indoor sports, which is no need for me: The gym might need a renovation. The spa is very good. \n\nI did visit Canggu several times and this is my favorite place to stay - I will return!",

We found Canggu to be a good starting point and reserved accommodation for 2 nights at the Kirana. We were not disappointed although the ocean view rooms have not much view of the ocean and soon will not have any Ocean view anymore due to the construction of a building nearby.\nThe hotel has a nice pool and a well equipped fitness room. Staff was very friendly and helpful and the grounds are well maintained with its own mini rice paddies. The hotel is close to the beach although the beach looks like more a spot for surfers and is less or not adequate for swimmers. We enjoyed the restaurant which serves nice dishes of good quality.",

Had the same experience regarding sulfate smell in bathroom, once you turn on the shower. In addition constant noise from the toilet. Cleanliness ok, but you could certainly enhance the bathroom. Bed comfortable. Breakfast great size and variety. Fresh juices however only on additional charge, which I certainly think shall be improved as a 4star hotel. You get great juices everywhere in this city at super low prices. Same for dinner. High prices, small portions / tasty but very expensive. My biggest complaint goes with regards to complaint management, which is very unprofessional. I provided 2 quality reviews with comments during and at the end of my stage, I further provided comments to staff and in writing on the bills without any return. Lastly, at the checkout nobody could assist me and they didn't return to me as promised. This was very disappointing. Lastly very inflexible in changing 1 day, claiming it was due to booking site restriction, but it wasn't. After discussing it was clear that they were unwilling to change, so I was charged an extra night at full price (far above their target price) although the hotel was empty! This was part of the complaint not treated. Also all suggestions provided seemed in vain. That's sad. But again, this goes to the management, not to the staff that is very friendly and helpful.",

I had such GREAT food at my other hotels throughout Bali, but the Kirana's room service and restaurant left much to be desired. The complimentary breakfast is decent, but the lunch and dinner options are pretty bland. Fortunately, there are ton of restaurants within walking distance. I encourage anyone who stays here to explore the shops and also take a car to Echo beach!",

We had a little hickup about the villa in the beginning but their fast response to make things right was amazing! The villa itself was fabulous and hugeeee! Perfect for those who got a big family! The foods were great! We had their breakfast pretty much everyday! We truly appreciate their great service in every single department ( front desk- housekeeping - f&b dept). Everyone was amazing and accomodating. Special shout out to Mrs. Komang ( the resident manager) and Mr. Dewa ( HK Manager), they went above and beyond to fix every issue encountered during our stay. \nAbout the location, it couldnt be more perfect located! Super close to both batu bolong beach and echo beah ( great deal for those who surf), and also there are tons of cool restaurant within walking distance! \n",

The staff is so friendly and makes you feel very welcome. During our stay we could attend Balinese dancing nights, blessing ceremony and rooftop movie night, but we were busy checking out the many great restaurant options in the area. Kirana is walking distance to the beach, but you will still need a scooter to get around the Canggu area. The beds and rooms were super comfy BUT the shower was in a very poor condition. It would smell like sewage for the first few seconds and the shower looked like it needs a serious scrub. The shower curtain is also stained with mould:-/\nThe Internet is also soooo slow that it's almost useless. The Internet is really fast everywhere else so I don't understand why it wouldn't be at the Kirana. ",

Sri was terrific with the kids.\nWe checked in to room 105 (a suite) which had more than enough space for me and my 2 young boys. The only negative was that the shower hasn't been maintained over time, so mould has formed in the grout. I've found that this is often the case in Bali hotels. Definitely not a deal breaker.\nTo top off a great experience, the boys got to feed the koi fish every morning while we waited for breakfast and they loved the complimentary golf cart ride to the beach each day.\nKirana was great value for money and I highly recommend.",

The rooms are plain but perfect for what you need, I think we may not have not enjoyed it as much if the room had not been pool accessible as it just gave it that nicer feel. The hotel is clean, staff are so helpful, friendly and give a five star service. We had breakfast, lunch and dinner here and the food was absolutely delicious! That's why we just kept eating there so hats off to the chief. The street the hotel is on is going through construction (although there was no noise pollution at all) but there was not much on the street for shopping etc. Its a very short walk to the beach and the beach has a great set up with a few bars. I would recommend this hotel especially beach lovers! As it seemed to be a surfers paradise. The reception is beautiful also set up outside just in front of the hotel. ",

Walking distance to Echo beach also. The Hotel staff is very friendly, loved all the ladies working there, always with a big smile on their face. The room had a comfortable huge bed, safe box, mini bar, clean towels every day and some of days also new toiletries. All rooms have their own balcony with pool view, on the higher level sea view also. On the top floor there is a spa. Breakfast options could have been better, for example they serve only Balinese coffee, if you ask for americano there is an extra charge. You can generally find really good places serving quality and variety of breakfast in the area. Pool area is cozy. We didn't try the restaurant. A little bit confusion at the payment process both during the booking process and as well as paying at reception for any other bill (minibar/transfers). They also didn't accept euros. The room had some maintenance issues as bathroom door was not closing or bathroom sink was blocking. We used their transfer services to/from airport they were on time.",

My room for the 1st 4 nights - the toilet squeaked and the air conditioner leaked - not so good for a hotel only 3 years old.\nThe next room - poolside - can be a bit noisy :( So if you are wanting a quieter room - opt for one on floor 2 or 3.\nThe breakfast which was included as part of our stay - not so healthy :( Would have been nice to have fresh juice, instead of the bottled variety.\nOverall the hotel is great value for money",

The price point suggests an average hotel.\nBut at any price it would be a rip off.\nSo before I tell you my story I will say that I expect to receive a letter back from management suggesting they did the best they could (ultimately agreeing with me of the disastrous circumstances and giving me back my money) \nThey have indeed refunded my money . \nNo apology or back peddling required. \nIt's still a disgrace and you should know about it!!\n1st room smelt like a sewerage collection centre\n2nd room smelt like the subsidiary of a waste collection centre\n3rd room smelt fine looked ok\nThe DVD player did not work\n3 attempts later and an hour wasted the DVD was up and running ... But no sound...\nOk we gave up on watching a movie. Time for bed\nI turn down the sheets and was immediately thrown by the smell of someone else's body odour emanating from the sheets\nOh dear Lord!!!!\nUpon further investigation the sheets were totally and disgustingly soiled from the previous inhabitants !!!!\nWe packed our bags\nCalled the manager\nHe himself was disgusted and offered us our money back\nThe end",

I found The Kirana through a group website, and since it was just down the road, booked it. The price was very reasonable, and check in was a breeze. We received some extremely bad information just as we were checking in and the girls at reception were so caring, thoughtful and empathetic. We were given an upgrade to a suite which overlooked the pool. We were given a refreshing cold drink as we arrived, and our bags brought to our room. We only needed the room for the afternoon as we were leaving for the airport at 10pm so we didn't use the bed. Other than the embarrassing Aussie yobbos in the pool, the room was delightful. The airconditioning worked very well (it was an extremely hot day) and didn't labour at all. The bathroom did have a sewer smell as can happen in Bali and we understand this. The room was well appointed, but my biggest comment would have to be the staff. Once again, friendly, compassionate, pleasant, helpful the list goes on. Please thank them again on our behalf. I would definitely stay here again, and mostly for the pleasantness of the employees. An absolute delight.",

Location was good, very short walk to the beach, and very short walk to the nearby restaurants up the street.  We tried to stay here again two weeks after but all rooms were booked.

Definitely recommend this place..",

We have travelled to Bali many but have not stayed in this area before and as such found it rather hard to decide where to stay as the area is very spread out.\nIn saying that I think we made a good choice although it did not start well. Our airport pickup did not eventuate and we caught a taxi instead which was really no hassle and ended up being cheaper anyway.\nCheckin was problem free. We had a room on the top level looking towards the ocean. There is building work going on next door so don't know how long this lovely view will last. Room was excellent. Comfy bed, good a/c and wifi.\nBreakfast was excellent. I had the best Eggs Benedict with good friendly service.\nI can't really class these as negatives but the pool is very public as are all the rooms on the ground floor and the bar prices were a little pricey.\nI used the Spa for a massage and it was excellent. One of the best massages I have had in Bali and not overly expensive.\nLocation was good. Walking distance to the beach and a good variety of restaurants. Remember, this area is not as developed and has no footpaths but also not as much traffic.\nThis area is not for everyone but if you venture out that way then you can't go wrong staying at the Kirana",

Must becareful with active toddlers, as the stair steps and swimming pool access are dangerous. I am amazed with the beautiful, big n clean villa. Downside is the open air shower in the upstair bedrooms. Other than that i think its okay. I havent try their food yet tho... peaceful, dont come here if you are looking for party scene",

              "text": "Just returned from two weeks in Bali, the first week being spent here. It was one of the quietest hotels I have ever stayed in, the staff were wonderful as was the room. We paid a little extra to have a 'suite' room and it didn't disappoint, spacious bathroom, lounge and fab bedroom with a large screen tv. The balcony, a little cramped, overlooked the pool but the ocean view wasn't as expected.\nWe had an inclusive breakfast every morning which was ordered from the varied menu, no buffet style here, was all cooked to order and was delicious! We never used the restaurant for dinner as there are many local places to choose from.\nThe staff are so lovely here, everyone was so helpful and friendly, spoke good English and we shared a few nights just sat at the bar chatting with them.\nLike many recently, we were worried about ash cloud, not knowing if we were actually going to fly, I emailed the hotel and they assured us the room would be held over until we did get there, that was reassuring as it was a non-refundable rate. Also I arranged a pick up from the airport (Au$34) and was greeted with a smile and an enthusiastic driver.\nOnly downside I found was the pool area, a bit cramped and the rooms that surround the pool seem to think the loungers are for them, we counted seven sunbeds for the whole hotel and didn't bother using it as the wonderful beach is 10 mins down the road.\nOverall, I would recommend and we hope to stay here again.",

              "text": "Booked Kirana because of the price and pics (which are often deceiving) but was not disappointed. Got a great slow season rate of $45 but upgraded to a deluxe room w great views for $12 more, def worth it. It's a simple hotel but clean and comfortable and excellent for the price. The service is excellent, even by Bali standards. Great massage for $15. There is a higher rate for the pool access rooms that doesn't make sense to me as you lose privacy and don't have a view, but that's just my personal opinion. The pool is a bit small and there are limited lounge chairs but they are limited on space, might be crowded in peak season. \nCanggu is awesome once you settle in. Great place to explore by motorbike and lots of good cafes bars and restaurants. It's a surfers' Mecca so you get that kind of vibe here.  Good people watching. \nWould definitely recommend Kirana and Canggu  (pronounced Chan goo)  ",

              "text": "The hotel is well maintained with good facilities including a restaurant, pool and spa. Rooms were nice but wifi was often not working. The pool sometimes does get crowded as it is quite small, with 8 loungers for guests from 30 rooms. Location wise, the hotel, while offering an ocean view from certain rooms, is really about 10-mins from the beach. However, it is a comfortable walk and there are also many nice restaurants nearby, and you can watch an amazing sunset if you walk out to the beach. Rooms could be cleaner as we found hair and dust that was not ours. I seriously injured myself quite badly during the stay as the stairways are dark with no handrails and I fell, leaving me unable to walk. Staff were very helpful in arranging transport to the hospital and airport, though the costs of everything including the requested late check out were never made transparent until we were presented with the bill. If visiting, please ensure that you clarify how much you are paying for each service, and in which currency, as I was surprised to be asked to pay my arrival transfer in USD and the departure one in IDR and told to go a money changer in my crutches to get the right currency changed. Overall, place is great as a base, especially for the price, but the level of service is functional due to what seemed like poor training for staff.",

The hotel offers a driver to take you to see the sights of the island (payable), which was very nice. The only complaint was the restaurant he stoppet at for lunch - expensive and not very tasteful food. Ask for a different restaurant if you do any of the tours. Other that that - enjoy your stay at the Kirana.",

It's relatively cheap, close to everything (beach, restaurants, my mates house etc). I loved the air con and the room service (very cheap and nice). The place even has a small gym which I used once.

The so called deluxe room was quite ordinary, in any 3 star hotel around the world. The pool was really tiny. The service was horrendous. We could only get one key per room, and when we requested an iron, there were none available for most of us. Apparently they only had one iron for the entire hotel that has 40 + rooms. \nThe internet was horrible, and even trying to chicken for your flight was a nightmare. Breakfast was ordinary and if there were a few people at a time you had mixed up orders and if you are time bound no breakfast before you need to head off. :)",

No compliantly whatsoever! \nRoom - great aircon, amazingly comfy bed, nice bathroom, enough to storage etc and a lovely pool view. Also very quiet and peaceful. \nCommunal area - big clean pool which gets sun most of the day, restaurant/lounge area tidy and well maintained, nice views of rice fields/gardens. \nStaff - very friendly. Wouldn't accept payment for some paracetamol when my fianc\u00e9 had a headache. Very polite and speak good English. I was surprised by the staff delivering a cake to our room and singing happy birthday to me!\nBreakfast - great selection of items included in room rate. Lots of food! \nOverall I would definitely recommend the Kirana to anyone looking for a relaxing and luxurious place to stay. I would suggest a room on 2/3rd floors as the poolside rooms aren't too private whilst the pool is open. \n\nOld mans\n\nVisited Old Man's with friends lots whilst in Canggu for 3 nights. Good and drinks excellent. Staff a bit lifeless but they're busy all day so probably a bit knackered which is understandable!! Very reasonably priced considering quality of food/drink, location and surroundings/decor. Very pleasant indeed. Will be going again next time were in Canngu.  ",

However, it is a bit odd to have people sit on the sun loungers just outside your door....we didn't mind but it is a bit odd. Only around 10 sun loungers for the entire hotel too, but it was never a problem as we spent most of our time at the beach. \n\nBreakfast was very good, staff very polite and only 5 minutes walk to the beach. Great restaurants a few minutes walk away, our favourite was Betelnut. Itahaca also very nice.\n\nA beautiful hotel in a quiet and lovely part of Bali, far away from the 'horribleness' of Kuta!! Would love to visit again",

Took 2 days for them to get it for us!\nThe restaurant service is painfully slow, b'fast for 6 people, took 40+ mins to arrive- we only ordered the standard American breakfast.\n\nNot much to do around, but Seminyak is not too far & Batu Balong is a nice beach.",

We stayed on the first floor right beside the pool, room and toilet were kept very clean throughout our stay and staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. We loved the room, comfy beds and fantastic view of the sunset 10 steps away from the bed.",

The food is fantastic, and the free breakfast is perfect. They had our laundry done in less than 12 hours and placed it in the room for us. The rooms are comfortable and clean with new amenities. We especially liked the rooftop deck for happy hour, they have 2 for 1 drinks and it is a perfect place to watch the sunset over the ocean. I will definitely be going beck.

              "text": "We could not have been happier with our stay at the Kirana Hotel. Staff was superb, always ready with a smile and would go the extra mile to help you out. Our room, while not that spacious, was adequate to our needs. Best part of the hotel was its Location! Walking distance to Old Man's and other restaurants. Only downer I could say about our stay was the food could use some improvement. Though we only ate there during breakfast time. But that experience alone did not make us crave to try out lunch or dinner there. There are a lot of great restaurants just outside the hotel so we just did that.\n\nKudos to the Front desk staff for arranging our transfers, our motorbike rental and dinner reservations at Kuta and Seminyak. \n\nTried out their couples massage and I could say that it was worth the money. Wifi could get iffy sometimes though. Also their shower partition was a little narrow so the bathroom floor would get wet when you take a bath. Other than that, I would definitely stay here again when we go back to Canggu next year.",

Friendly, attentive and fun, these guys have it sorted! The hotel is a short walk to the beach which is really lovely. My only thoughts are that they need to sort out the pool area as access to rooms on ground floor can be compromised by sun beds. Definitely be back.",

The staff were exceptionally friendly and it was a touch sad to say goodbye when we left. The rooms were of a very high standard and we enjoyed our breakfast and both evening meals in the hotel restaurant. The Kirana is well situated with the beach only a five minute walk down the road with lots of cafes and shops along the way. If there was one issue, it was that there are no power points for use of a hairdryer in the bathroom. A hairdryer is provided in most rooms but there is no power point near a mirror. Only a minor complaint in what otherwise was a memorable holiday.",

It starts from the moment you check in, to the porter, to the restaurant staff, to the staff in the spa. They're happy to help and always with a smile on their face. The location is great as well. Just a short walk down to Old Man's and the beach. Our favourite cafe is Betelnut and it's just a short walk away as well. If you're tired of walking or looking to go a bit farther afield they also have complimentary bikes. Rooms are clean with comfy beds. If you don't have kids, I would maybe recommend not going for a room by the pool. Can be a bit loud in the morning.",

It has a miniature rice paddy out the front which we saw planted over the course of our stay. \nThere's not much to do at the hotel itself, but they have free daily shuttles to Seminyak, and happily arrange a driver for any other travelling you like. \nHotel staff are super-friendly and helpful and it's a great  home base for your holiday. \nFood and drinks in the hotel restaurant were comparatively expensive for Bali, and Canggu itself is quite expensive - It costs twice as much to get a taxi out of the area as it does to get in. The spa services in the hotel are excellent and very good value, I would have made more use of them if I didn't need to book 2 days ahead. That they were always fully booked just proves how good the therapists are. \n\nIn a few months, when the construction in the area is complete, and its possible to walk to the beach and not dodge cars & bikes, this will be a very popular place to stay.",

But my Kirana room was spotless clean and i LOVE the bed. Breakfast was YUM!\nRooftop is a nice spot for sunset cocktails and I regret that I have missed the movie screening. The pool looks nice for a dip after a hot day under the sun but i was mostly at the beach. The 1-hour massage truly was one of the highlights. Ms. Komang the therapist has magic hands i would rate her a 9! Cant wait to go back !",

The hotel staff was so friendly especially Lynda and Dewa that we decided on the back end of our 3 week trip we would go back to stay two more nights! And we did. The rooms were nicely decorated, clean and bed was super comfortable loved the pillows.  A good nights sleep after a long travel is always needed.  They served a great breakfast included in your stay which is not unusual in Bali and the food was good.  Went to the spa as they had a great package for couples and so I went for it. If you like surfing, mopeds in not such a congested part of Bali, good vibe Beach restaurants and fun bars with a chill vibe this is your spot. I loved Canggu and really liked the Kirana.  We will be back!",

              "text": "We have stayed in Canggu before, and the stay at this hotel was great. It was centrally located, walking or scootering distance to food and beach. We stayed on the top floor and had a spacious room with ocean views and a veranda. There is a lift if you don't want to use the stairs. Beach towels were supplid and there was a hairdryer and toiletries in the room. The staff were really helpful, friendly, warm and welcoming. Nothing was too much trouble.\nFor breakfast there were several choices from traditional indo (give it a try - it was different but yummy) to fruit, eggs, pancakes and pastries - that were all equally good. We had the occasional lunch and dinner, that were also good and reasonably priced. The cappuccino was good and a real surprise. \nWe used the spa, and this was very reasonably priced. There are really cheap places about - but I have a few back issues that I don't want to aggravate. The staff were really good in this regard.\nIt was Indonesian Independence day during our stay. What we loved was that the hotel and staff had an afternoon of celebration for the local children. The staff organised games (getting coins out of watermelons with teeth, placing eels in bottles and colouring contests), food and a lot of fun. The staff did a pillow fight over a pit of mud, which was enjoyed by all. A guest came second on this contest! It was lovely to see some helping the community - the 50 or so kids had a great time and the staff did a good job of managing this and guests.",

The hotel is great, and sometimes, you don't want to leave!\nThe sun beds by the pool are limited, so get there fast and bask under the sun the whole day!\nThe pool was actually very cold, from the 9 days we were there, I got in only once.\nThe wifi isn't that strong if you have some actual work to do, so don't depend on it. Nearby cafes, and Salty Volt may offer better connections.\n\nThe gym is also quite small, but serves the basics.\n\nWe had a great stay at the Kirana compared to other places in Canggu that are more expensive and offer way less. \n\nEnjoy it!",

My bf didnt want to move rooms, so I had to stay there. The aircon is like a machine, which is super loud. They gave us the room on the first floor with full view on the pool. In the morning it is very noisy, as it also overlook on the restaurant where the breakfast is. The pillows are also synthetic and very uncomfortable, obviously the hotel of such a standard doesnt have good ones.\nOnly after check out, we went to another room and saw an ocean. After checking our reservation, which was sea view, they tried to convinced us that our room is a sea view!!! Nonsense. Overall very poor service, quality and cheating reservation system.\nWont recommend to anyone. Very disappointed.",

Madness! \n\nUsed the spa whilst staying here, that too was fabulous and worth every penny. Highly recommend. \n\nI can't say enough about the wonderful staff, so welcoming and friendly, really make you feel at home and nothing is too much of an ask. Thank you. \n\nBreakfast was one of the best we've had in Bali, excellent quality and lots of choice. \n\nRooms clean with good sizes. \n\nPool access rooms aren't worth the extra, not private enough two of the eight sunbeds are right outside your door with people sunbathing on them (couldn't even use a subbed outside your own door) so we had to keep our curtains closed most of the time which goes against the whole idea of having a pool access room.  \n\nLovely and quiet at night. Would recommend if you're wanting to stay in Canggu or near echo beach. \n\n",

When I was bitten by a wasp they took care of me and supplied ointment and checked on me for days afterwards (thank you Sri & Putu!). I was stuck in Bali because of the volcanic eruption and spent an extra 4 nights here. Clean, great bed, breakfast was adequate with a number of options. Beach is a short walk, or hire a scooter from the hotel for the best of Canggu. Deus and Betelnut are down the road, as is Old Man's. Thanks for my home away from home x",

The Kirana staff was very helpful, friendly and beyond accommodating.  The property itself is lovely, stylish yet comfortable room and a great breakfast! The location is so close to the beach, shops and restaurants.  We had the couples massage package in the spa and was blown away with how relaxing and romantic it was...neither of us had every done anything like this and really enjoyed. Yes we have been to a spa, just not doing the treatments together. What a epic experience and incredible spa staff. We really enjoyed our stay and have already looked at booking a few more nights later in our trip before returning home.  If you want to get away from all the noise in Kuta and Seminyak, but still have great vibe, close to beach with good shops, restaurants and a relaxing place to stay, this is the spot!  And it is a new property with a great pool and grounds.  Can't wait to go back!",

              "text": "Positives: Walking distance to Batu Bolong / Canggu / Echo beach - famous surf spots. Close by to a few restaurants and bars - as such, there's no need to go to Seminyak unless it's for a specific restaurant or for one of the big clubs i.e., Potato Head, Ku De Ta. Love the landscape design and interior deco. Good service by the staff. Decent food at the in-house restaurant. Great 2-in-1 paddy field view on the way to the beach. I'd suggest getting a bike/bicycle if you'd like to explore the area - maybe to check out the different beachfronts (they are about 5 mins away from each other).\n\nNegatives: Shower and sink drainage wasn't too great. Wi-fi signal is poor and can be improved.",

A very warm welcome awaited us when we reached Kirana. Our rooms were nice and cosy though the size of the room was little small but was done beautifully. The choice of breakfast was limited but the food was tasty and good. The place is surrounded by nice eating joints so one has a lot of options to choose from. The staff was very friendly and courteous. We for sure would highly recommend this place. The spa services were average.",

I picked this hotel because it was the cheapest place I could find that still looked liveable! \n\nWhen we arrived we were in total shock, 10 mins away from Seminyak and we arrived in paradise, the resort upgraded us to the penthouse suite which was beautiful of them. the room was to die for with views of the beach close by. the food in the restaurant was like dining in a 5 star restaurant back home! the staff were probably the best part about the stay (excluding the room of course), everyone was lovely and made us feel very special. \n\nWe got massages in the spa and they were amazing too! If we wanted to go to Seminyak there were free shuttle buses that ran throughout the day, alternatively you could ask for staff to call a car for you which would be at a set price, which is just how we like it. \n\n5 mins down the road is the beach with food options along the way! The staff even gave us a tour of the four bedroom villa they have at the hotel which is seperate to the resort, it is like a beverly hills mansion and we will be heading back there with friends at the end of the year!",

Good food, great fast service.\n\nAll the staff are very nice and super helpful. They also have complimentary push bikes, which is a nice touch",

Old Man's Beach and a variety of restaurants and services are only a short walk away. It's as far removed from the chaos of Kuta as it is from a beach bungalow with roaming chickens and cows. It's clean, quiet, and friendly, but you won't find yourself hanging out with locals at the bar. \nThe most outstanding part of the hotel is the service. As a solo traveler. I asked a lot of questions and took a lot of everyone's time. Everyone went out of their way to make sure I had everything I needed for my adventures, and always with a smile. The staff is outstanding - friendly, professional, and efficient. \nI miss the old Bali a bit, but it's nice to see Balinese hospitality hasn't changed.",

              "text": "Decent stay. Ups and downs. Inconsistent in quality. \nAlthough a bit small, rooms are fine (we had a second floor room with views on the ocean). Balcony small (not that it mattered to me, but might for some). \nDisappointed with bathroom : nowhere to put your shower gel and shampoo etc... The shower screen doesn't go all the way to the floor which results in a flooded bathroom floor at each shower... The water wasn't too hot either. \nThe air con remote wasn't working so we had to ask for replacement batteries. Tthey did it straight away, so it's no big deal. \nThe water bottles by the sink (as you can't drink tap water on the island) had lids that require bottle openers but non was provided... \nThe WiFi is not great, but it could vary from one room to the other, I'm unsure. Ours was pretty average (although I know we can live without the Internet!)\n\nThe hotel has nice facilities. \nThe breakfast is ok, the service is a little slow though. \n\nSpecial note about the spa : the girls are really good. The treatment was delightful (romance package). I have now had a serious number of massages done in Bali over the past 7 years, and this one is definitely on my top 3. The view is lovely, and my therapist was just amazing. Worth the money (just don't forget to add the 21% tax on fees). My partner didn't want a scrub, so he got something else instead at no extra charge. \n\nLocation of the hotel is great. Few meters away from restaurant/bar Lacalita (few cocktails and tacos maybe?!! , and 5 minutes away from OldMans and the beach.",

              "text": "We were very pleased with our suite when we arrived. We got a 'trip advisor deal' that included a meal, welcome cocktail & massage, towels, robes etc. The breakfast was good & the staff were lovely. However, the shower leaked badly flooding the floor and the plumbing above & around the bedroom was so noisy it felt like we were inside a washing machine. As the suites were on the ground floor beside the pool it meant we did not have any outdoor space like a balcony, I hung some clothes to dry in our bathroom on the washing line provided but it took days for them to dry & they smelled funny. It's also a bit odd having strangers sunbathing right outside your room. Advice- if you stay in a suite get up early & claim your sun beds with towels (I don't like doing this as I think it's anti-social but there's really no other option).\nOn the up side, it's an easy walk to restaurants & the beach. Old man's beach club is lively, popular and cool- we enjoyed food, drinks and music there. Bikes are available to go further. The hotel is in a lovely spot and the pool is small but very refreshing :)",

Location is very convenient. Close to old mans surf break. Fantastic coffee shops and restaurants just a short walk away. Have stayed in a few places in Canggu. I would recommend this hotel. It was just too easy. No mosquito bites either :) ",

But what really makes the Kirana stand out is their staff. From their front manager to the most random bellhop, the staff at the Kirana genuinely want to help, and will do whatever they can to make your stay perfect. \n\nI stayed here for more than two weeks while doing a yoga teacher training nearby. I ordered lots of room service, had packages mailed here, and got rides in their hotel shuttle at odd hours. The way I travel, using hotels as a base of operations, really brings out the strengths and weaknesses in a place. I have a lot of random needs. The staff at Kirana got it done for me, from a pair of scissors to helping me track down a difficult package I had sent there long after I'd checked out. You really are in excellent hands at the Kirana. Get the chicken sat\u00e9, watch the sun go down from the pool or your balcony and make friends in the restaurant. I'm definitely coming back!",

Hotel is new so local drivers dont really know the location of it, so good advice to write down the adress as on room key there is none. Rooms are nice and designed with taste, size of it could be a bit disadventage for longer stays, but for those who re sightseeing whole days it shouldnt be a problem. Personally I am glad we didnt book a pool room as pool area can be noisy not only from people and nearby restaurant but also from water which is splashing outside infinitive pool with every move. Staff was very frendly and helpful. We had 1 meal in the restaurant which was delicious, but a bit expensive to use in long time period, so we went for dinners at local restaurant Ithaka nearby.",

We arranged to be picked up from the airport, didn't mind the extra cost as we didn't want the hassle of getting a taxi from the airport, it is a little mad there. We also arranged through the hotel to get taken back to the airport, they only use local staff, not taxis, so be prepared to pay a little extra, 200,000 back to the airport was fine with us. A nice walk to the beach, with local markets and a bar. The hotel has bikes you can borrow, which is a nice touch. Lots of good cafes, bars & restaurants walking distance from the hotel too. Overall, absolutely loved our time there!",

The food was again very good thanks to the input of Made, i hope that will continue now he has gone. Room service and the general service are as good as any 4 star hotel we have stayed at in Bali, which has been many. The surrounding restaurants are also good and of course Old mans bar and restaurant 200-300 metres away can't be faulted particularly 5-6 pm mon -fri for the happy hour, 2 beers for $2.50 every Ozzies dream :) this also includes wines and spirits so all tastes are catered for. Great area of bali for families and surfers with echo beach 5 minutes away. still think Old mans beach is better.",

Pool area is so uninviting we stayed one day and left after booking in for a week. Pity help the poor people who booked the \"pool access\" rooms only to find other guests right outside their front door occupying the very few cushionless lounges available. This means you are a prisoner in your room and have all the noise directly outside. The rooms are all tiny as are the balconies. On the plus side the staff are great and food seemed OK.",

Ideally situated within walking distance of the beach (5-7 min), surfing, and good restaurants (literally across the street). Guests could walk anywhere or arrange for scooters or very hospitable private drivers from the region through the hotel.\n\nHotel meals were of high quality and very tasty. Occasional inconsistencies (e.g., same breakfast order prepared differently on different days or ran out of mango). \n\nIn general, the hotel aims to please. From a friendly smile and welcome drink at 1am to a free foot massage by room to not having to worry about personal belongings (unlike some other hotels in the area) - all very appreciated.  I\n\nTake advantage of the local connections at the front desk - from renting a scooter to getting leather workers to visit you at the hotel for your measurements and custom made jacket. I would strongly strongly recommend this hotel for great quality-price value.",

The food in the caf\u00e9 around were much more lovely and so much cheaper.. they should adapt their prices to Bali and make it cheaper..\nImproving a bit the quality..\n Breakfast was a la Carte.. I rather buffet breakfast but they had this a la carte way. However the food wasn't great again...don't have bacon and eggs avoid it cause it doesn't taste like it should at all (being used to Australian lovely caff\u00e8 breakfast? Here pancakes and everything else was a bit disappointing...) they should make the portion bigger and study the breakfast menu better.\nThe pool was lovely but the sun started to cover it a bit late plus there aren't enough beds for all guests around the pool. \nAt the end I'll come back to the Kirana,  I'd just avoid eating there...but I'm sure they could improve some things!

Very beautiful area away from the hustle and bustle of kuta etc. Easy shuttle to seminyak. Beautiful, clean pool. Generally very well maintained. Good restaurant and excellent, small spa.\nWould recommend, but I think after a few nights you may wish to move on as there isn't much going on other than pure relaxing. ",

We took walks watching them and then grabbed some food nearby.\n\nThere are a ton of restaurants within walking distance. Be sure to check out Betelnut, Old Man's, Lacalita, Crate and the grill at Echo beach.\n\nWe also did horseback riding along the beach that was a bit expensive but fun.\n\nThe staff at Kirana is the best of all! They are so friendly and helpful. \n\nI highly recommend spending some time at the Kirana if you'll be in Bali. Enjoy!",

              "text": "I spent two weeks at the Kirana Resort and Spa.  It was as close to perfect as I can imagine.  The location was perfect for me.  It was quiet and not crowded. Five minute stroll to the beaches.  Walking distance to many very good restaurants.  But the food at the Kirana was so good, many evenings I did not go out to eat.  My package included the breakfast and it was delicious and there was so much food I never ate lunch, but would have a light snack around 2:00. The staff at the Kirana were always pleasant and friendly.  They spoke excellent English and always exceeded expectations.  The shuttle into Seminyak was a terrific free benefit offered and taken.  My bed at the Kirana was better than the last 5 star hotel I was at the week before. I highly recommend this Hotel. I hope to be back there soon.",

              "text": "We definitely loved The Kirana Hotel!!!! We loved how comfortable the beds were, how swiftly the check in and check out were done, the warm service of the staff, the ambiance, everything about the hotel we loved except for a few minor things! Since we were travelling as a group, it was a bit awkward that from the outside you could see what a person is doing inside the bathroom. So for a group, it would be a bit uncomfortable for you to take a shower and do your business when people can see you. I hope they can address this issue like improving the curtains that cover the CR window --  just remembered also that the bath/shower area is not fully covered, meaning if you're taking a shower, water will splatter all over the CR. One time the floor was flooded because there was no walls/curtains to contain water splashes. But we definitely loved our room! It had a nice view of the pool and the bed was really comfortable. :) We also loved that they have bikes for rent for free! The hotel is probably a 5-10min to Batu Bolong beach in Canggu. Which on a humid day in Bali would be draining and tiresome! Fortunately they have bicycles for rent for free which made our morning surf session more comfortable. :) I just wished these bikes were well maintained. They also offer motorbike rentals (for a minimum fee of IDR 50,000 this is definitely cheaper than rental in Kuta of IDR 100,000). They also have free transfers to certain areas but we weren't able to maximize this because we had a good driver with us (Deni from YourBaliDriver.com). We loved our stay here, we will definitely come back. :) The staff were very attentive, patient, accommodating and warm to us versus of another 4 star hotel in Kuta! Loved everything about this hotel except the CR :D food was okay, it's just plated meal. In general, you get more than what you pay for. I hope they don't increase prices anytime soon. :D",

Staff are very friendly and helpful. The new chef is amazing - even cooked our group of 8 a special 5 course meal for $17 each. We ate most of our meals at the hotel because the quality was excellent as was the variety.Spa was great, pool was great and the rooms very comfortable. No complaints at all!\nHotel provided free transportation in to town for shopping  plus free airport shuttle.Would definitely stay at this hotel again.",

              "text": "I am currently staying at this hotel while writing this review and couldn't be happier.  Walked up without a reservation to see what type of deal I could get.  They gave me a ocean view with breakfast each day for 2 and dinner for 2 one night, 15 minute welcome massage, free taxi around canggu and I beleive into seminyak but haven't tried that yet for 75$ a night with all taxes and fees.   Nice big room, king bed and excellent service. Tomorrow I will try a full massage at the spa which is  9$ for an hour.  Sure you can stay up the street for 16$ and that's great, but the service, cleanliness, extra space, balcony with view of the ocean, free breakfast and upscale feel of this place is worth the extra 60 dollars while traveling with my lady.  I would probably spring for it even if I was by myself after seeing what this place has to offer.  This is great value and I'm sure during peak season you can't just walk up and get this rate but I have no desire to come here when everyone does so for me this is a winner.  I probably could have bargained my way down even more but this seemed to be a  super fair price.  If this was in Hawaii or Florida this room would easily cost 300-500 a night.  Can't say enough about how polite and welcoming the staff is.  Do yourself a favor and stay here.",

Of course, I had heared about the hospitality of the balinese People, but being presented with that in a context of high level, professional hotel environment kind of blew my mind;-) Everything, starting from the subtle, but reliable service, the regularly cleaned, beautiful rooms, the fantastic food provided from the amazing kitchen crew combined with a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere- Stay at the Kirana, if you want to make the most out of your experience in this wonderful part of Bali! Located in the laid back area of Changgu, this is a must-go for everyone, who likes to enjoy a perfect time at very reasonable prices in an amazing place. Thanks to everyone for making me want to come back there again!",

That's because The Kirana and Canggu exemplify the best Bali has to offer. The Kirana's staff are warm, genuine and go out of their way to help. Komeng, Sri, Wira, Putu, Ade, Aiik, Poni and Rima are so committed to doing a good job and making each guests stay the best it can be. The hotel is so calm and welcoming that we felt so relieved to come back there every day. It was lovely reading in the lobby or reception area, lazing by the pool or resting in the room. The spa is wonderful too and incredibly good value. But get in early because it is popular and you need to book ahead. We had breakfast included which like anywhere does become repititive. That's no fault of The Kirana's. I like that they don't have a wasteful breakfast banquet and there are many breakfast options close by when you need some variety.  We stayed for nine days so it wasn't as if we only had one or two nights. Even after that time it was hard to leave because Canggu is still semi-rural still with many restaurant, cafe, spa and shopping options. There's none of the mad traffic and mayhem that has bled into Seminyak and Kerobakan. So at the end of your holiday you return home relaxed rather than with a sore head.",

The hotel feels warm and welcome, and the crew just makes it better. The rooms are perfect and the bed is the best we experienced during our trip. The breakfast is perfect and has a lot of options for many different visitor from different regions. The swimming pool isn't that big and only had sunlight during the middle of the day, but who cares! You're like 5 minutes away (walk) from Canngu beach and another 15 from Echo beach. By the way: visit the Pirate bar at Echo, really worth a visit for some lunch. Last but not least: the hotel has a new chef which really tries to change the standards. He is a top chef which really could make this hotel top of the bill. Keep it going like this people! ",

Our needs and requirements were met by Lynda and all her staff. The hotel location is perfect. Caf\u00e9s, beaches and shops are on your door step. The hotel breakfast had great variety, you order anything you like from the menu, ranging from eggs to pancakes and fruit. The rooms are modern and are wrapped around the pool. Our room wasn't available at time of check in so we were lucky enough to stay in the penthouse for 2 nights. The penthouse was pure paradise, we had our own plunge pool overlooking over beautiful rice fields. If you have the money to splurge or are staying for a special occasion I would recommend the penthouse. Once moving to our other room we were pleasantly surprised, we booked a pool access room so we could jump straight into the pool! The beds were very comfortable.\nNo complaints here! Our friends stayed at a hotel up the road for triple what we paid and they hated there hotel. I am so glad we chose to pay less because the Kirana was fabulous! You can't go wrong with price and what you get. \n\nThankyou Kirana, we will be back :)\n",

The hotel is very well appointed and is only about a year old.  The rooms are quite well appointed and roomy. The upper floors have a great view of the ocean and surrounding areas. The hotel staff are welcoming and courteous without being overbearing or intrusive.  The restaurant dining for all meals is of a very high standard and extremely well priced.  They offer a courtesy bus as either a pic up or drop off to the airport but not both.  This was my only fault with the hotel.  That said I would definitely recommend this hotel to couples and families alike.  Try it and see for yourself.  I'm glad I did as i will be going back to this place again. ",

Restaurant food was good and especially chef for the Christmas dinner was marvellous. I can recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a good place to stay and wanting to enjoy some peaceful time together",

              "text": "We really enjoyed our stay here, and there is very little to fault.\n\nAccommodation is 5 minutes walk from the beach, and set back from the road (note - it only has a small sign outside which can easily be missed by taxis).\n\nRooms overlook the central infinity style pool and have far reaching views to the sea. They are of a high standard with comfortable beds, oversized pillows and soft linen. Bathrooms & shower are decent but the grouting has discoloured (didn't bother us at all). \n\nRooms also have a balcony which is a bonus. Satellite tv worked with good signal & western movie channels. Air co also effective and not noisy. \n\nOn arrival you receive a drink & free foot massage voucher which is a nice touch.\n\nThere are push bikes available. Wifi streams throughout the hotel, and there is a PC in the lobby.\n\nWe had a few snacks from the restaurant which were ok-ish, but we preferred to eat out.\n\nWhat really sets this hotel apart is the staff. They were exceptionally friendly and helpful with a good sense of humour.\n\nWe had to leave at 6.30am for a ferry to the gili islands so they arranged for the chef to come in early to cook us breakfast. Definitely went the extra mile to please!!\n\nRepresents outstanding value for money & had a great stay. Couldn't recommend more highly.\n\n",

              "text": "I had the absolute pleasure of staying at the Kirana Bali for an entire month.\nAs I was studying a very intense course near by,I needed somewhere I could come home to and relax at the end of some very stressful days with assignments, exams etc.\nThe staff at Kirana did every thing possible to minimise my stressors, from making sure I would get my hot breakfast every day (as my course required I leave before the kitchen opened) to running errands, picking up shopping for me & even driving me to the Drs when I was sick and coming back to pick me up in the early hours of the morning and making sure I had all the supplies I needed to get better.After one month with the beautiful staff they began to feel like family and the Kirana truly felt like my home in bali.When my husband came to visit me for only 3 days the staff from reception helped me to organise some unforgettable dates to make the most of the short time we had.My favourite was sunset horseriding along the beach,it was very romantic and the photographs I will cherish forever.We also enjoyed the 2hour pamper package at the Kirana Spa which includes body massage,scrub and mask as well as a facial,using divine products.The kitchen has a great selection of meals and make the best pavlova I have ever had, there are also many quality but very affordable restaurants with in meters walking distance from the Kirana.The beach is only a 2min walk and there are 2 other beaches also with in walking distance.The Kirana has a gorgeous gym and I found it perfect for a short daily weights session.I would highly recommend the Kirana to singles,couples and families.I stayed in the deluxe sea view which was absolutely Devine,the view was amazing and you could hear the waves crashing on the beach,it has evry thing you would expect to find in a five star hotel and it was lovely to relax in the bath tub after a long day of study.on the days of check in and check out I stayed in the deluxe pool access room and it was stunning also (I would recommend this if you intend to spend the days relaxing poolside).\nI would advise travellers to make any required arrangements in the day time with the assistance of reception (especially a beautiful lady called Ade, her English is superb and she is so very kind & helpful) as in the evening the boys at reception are still lovely but English is not as good if you have finer details to go thro.So if it is important organise it in the daytime, that said evening staff always tried their absolute best usually worked out what I was trying to say eventually :)\nI also found that if there is any communication issues just speak slowly,be polite and keep smiling you get a lot further than if you are are short tempered and rushed -good advice when speaking to any locals in bali.\nI would also advise travellers to email the Manager Dewa if you have any special requests or requirements as he is very helpful and flexible and will do everything to make sure any requests are accommodated for, as he did with my breakfast arrangements etc.\nI can not wait to return to my home in Bali.I hope to see you there.",

Our room was clean and the beds extremely comfortable. We ate at the hotel as walking on the streets is dangerous due to no footpaths however cafes and restaurants are not too far away. The food was of a reasonable quality however it sometimes arrived a little cold but this would be our only complaint. The music played in the Koi restaurant was a little loud and very repetitive. The staff were very friendly and always went out of their way to help and provide us with information and assistance. The spa staff provided an excellent service. I came away from our stay at the Kirana much relaxed and refreshed.",

              "text": "Booked this because found the idea of being in a peaceful setting away from the buzz of Kuta and other busier areas tempting. Ended up spending unnecessarily much time in taxis, so, in retrospect, accepting a less quiet location would seem to have been a better idea.\nThe location seems to be very good for surfing, as the (not really attractive) beach is only about 500 meters away, and the Canggu beach waves seem to be better than at Kuta (which seems to be for beginners.) Other than that, there was not much useful in the immediate vicinity of the hotel: the choice of restaurants is narrow, and the drive or ride to elsewhere was always 30+ minutes. The most interesting stuff found here but not in Kuta were lots and lots of rice paddies, and a dozen of cows along the road to the beach.\n\nThe hotel itself is quite good. We paid a good sum of money for a suite with a separate bedroom, with nice floors and furniture and a very good bath room. The only issues we had were that there was a some sand on the floor (mainly living area) when we arrived and it did not get cleaned during our 3 night stay, and the bath tub drained very very slowly (Probably sand! This kind of things should be checked by the cleaning staff regularly, and not left to the guests to complain). At the price level we paid we felt that cleaning and maintenance should have been at a completely different level!\nThere was a small gap under the door to the corridor (which is open air), and a number of largish insects crawled in in the evening and night. Not a big deal, but would probably be easy to fix.\nTV was newish and largish flat screen, but TV reception was poor, with lots of noise on most channels. Internet was occasionally very slow, but usually worked.\nBreakfast options were good (not a buffet, but order a la carte from a number of good alternatives.)",

              "text": "The Kirana is located in a very pleasant part of Canggu, with the beach close by and plenty of nice places to eat.\nThe rooms are nice and with plenty of space, even when travelling with 3 surf boards, but already show some signs of wear, despite only being open since April 2014. The beds were the highlight, as these are extremely comfortable.\nIt also provides a nice pool, with some limited space around it but still nice place to chill.\nThe staff was always very helpful and we felt very easy to ask for anything at the hotel, even advice on where to rent motorbikes was available.\n\nUnfortunately it needs some simple improvements to make it an ideal place to stay. The room cleaning was never done until very late in the day. I think over a period of 20 days our room was only already cleaned before lunch time twice. This is a little bit of a nuisance as waking up very early for surf, means we were ready for a snooze after lunch, but this was rarely possible as we had to wait for the room to be cleaned or ask the reception for this to be done.\nNot only the timing of the cleaning was wrong, but the level of the cleaning was very poor. Our room towards the end of the stay just smelled terrible as the bathroom was not cleaned properly, toilet paper was rarely replaced and the bedding was left a few days too long before changing, even when requested to be done, it seemed to be ignored. \nThis is one of the basic requirements in a hotel of this level.\nAlso the restaurant left much to be desired, the breakfast was very pointless. It seemed the restaurant was trying to advertise itself more, by promoting live music and traditional music. If they had enough space to do this, it would be fine, but with the arrangement of the hotel, the noise was pretty loud in the room.\n\nAlso in case the hotel management is reading, seems many places in Bali offer drinking water refills for free, this is a measure to try to reduce the usage of plastic bottles, would be nice if hotels like this were part of this in order to try to reduce the pollution issue in Bali. \n\nIt certainly is a nice spot to be for a short stay.\n ",

Every morning I would wake up early to have breakfast and take a bike ride down to Canggu Beach.  Every day was heaven!!",

Lovely fresh cooked breakfast choices each morning, no buffet!  Staff helpful & friendly apart from the cartridge in printer at reception was not fixed over 4 days of being there & any area maps info or receipts were not printed out which would have been more convenient. The spa was very good & reasonably priced & we used this several times but please fix the speaker in the roof, as it takes away from the relaxing background music. Small but lovely pool to cool off in but there needs to be just a few more chairs around for guests, even the small type that are on balconies would be sufficient (just a suggestion as lounges are taken quickly) The bicycles are excellent for guests to use but would just suggest: either front basket or a back carrier on all bikes not just both on 2 bikes! The others need something as well. We thoroughly enjoyed cycling all over Canggu & ended up hiring cycles just up & across the road from the hotel so we could use them everyday. Great way to find restaurants & explore Echo beach area. Safe to get around as traffic is a lot less in Canggu.",

Nice staff, friendly and clean, and in a perfect location. The only thing I would say is that you can't order a normal local taxi from this area as there is a Canguu-wide ban, which makes going into Seminyak or anywhere else difficult unless you have your own transport. Also, there was quite a lot of loud music in the general reception and restaurant - I think most people would like less of this....The breakfast, as many have said already, is not great - it would be nice to just be able to choose from an al a carte list. Saying this, this is a really nice good value option in the area if you need somewhere comfortable for a night or two.",

Close to all eateries and beaches.. It has an amazing moat full of huge koi..we were welcomed by a lovely girl with a huge friendly smile whom showed us to our room.. Staff are amazing.. After eating a set menu for breakfast for two days we decided to venture out and explore.. Close by are wonderful organic eateries, A French coffee/patisserie cafe and of course Deus.. My recommendation to Kirana would be mindful of the style of music they play.. It's a place where people search for a chilled experience..also need to look at providing a few more sun lounges.. Otherwise a totally fantastic stay..",

It is great if you just want accommodation to sleep in but are planning to be out and about exploring the rest of the time. ",

One place we will book again for sure ...\nWe had a few problems with the spa, my friend (female) and I had a massage in same room to finish, they ran a flower bath to watch the sun set, BUT they expexted us both to hop in together a regular size bath, just a little close for comfort, we are friends not partners .... Other than that highly recomend ....",

Bathroom is basic but good enough. Despite some crying baby's in the early mornings in the hallway, I had a good sleep.\nPool is very small and if you don't have a room at the pool.... forget about having a seat. Wifi is also not working in the rooms (signal not strong enough). \nKirana is super well located and walking distance from the beach, Old Man bar, Deus, Kaki Lima, etc. Bikes are available at the hotel and we also rented scooters at 50k rp per day to discover the area. Taxi is advisable to go to Seminyak.",

The vibe was definitely a surfer paradise vibe but there were people of all ages and nationalities there.\n\nThe staff at the hotel were tremendous! They were very quick to help in any way possible.  It was also great to still see the Balinese culture peeking out in the midst of so many tourists that did not even attempt to use the local language and were, at times, quite demanding.  \n\nWe utilized the laundry service and were very pleased.  We also used the spa services and were delighted to have both services right there on the premises with such great service.\n\nWe will stay again!",

The hotel is new with modern design, although the bathroom tiles already look tired, this could be due to humidity or poor maintenance.  The pool is great and the location is fantastic, such a short walk to the beach.  We found the Hotel has a particularly friendly atmosphere amongst guests, this is reflective of Canggu as an area which is laid back, beach town vibe.  \n\nLoved the free access to bikes, welcome massage and helpful staff.  The spa is very good quality, there are cheaper options down the road but are not of the same quality.\n\nThe only thing the hotel lacks is a quality restaurant, the breakfast is okay.  The dinner menu is also alright but the prices do not reflect the quality of the food.  However, there are plenty of other dinner options within walking distance.  The hotel is also experimenting with some late night entertainment events that I am not sure fit the scope of what travellers are looking for, it also meant putting up with loud club music from 6pm until 11pm on Friday night (rooms are pretty sound proof so it is not too bad).  I think this is a teething process until they work out what kind of events/activities are popular.  In the mean time Old Man's bar next to the beach plays fantastic music, and has great food.\n\nI would still recommend this hotel to everyone I know, it really is a fantastic quality hotel, for a great price and a wonderful location.  We hope to come back soon.",

The massages were excellent and the spa staff were well trained, friendly and accommodating to your needs.  The room was large enough and most had a good view of the ocean.  I would definitely stay at the Kirana again.  Thanks for a great holiday!",

              "text": "We try and review nearly all our travel activity but very nearly didn't write a review for The Kirana cause we don't want anyone else to know about it. We want it to be available every time we want to go there! Found it on a travel brokers site and the first thing we noticed was an amazing price so researched further. It very nearly fell into the 'too good to be true' bracket so we were initially concerned about what the catch was going to be but there seriously wasn't one. From the moment we arrived we could not have been treated better. The property is really unique with the reception area located away from the actual accommodation complex. We had a room on the second floor overlooking the pool with a west facing balcony to take advantage of the amazing sunsets. The room wasn't huge but was more than adequate and the bathroom was terrific. Seeing the hotel is quite small (30 rooms) breakfast isn't the traditional buffet style but is actually cooked as it's ordered. The three options are Indonesian, American and The Kirana Special with the latter ending up being our favourite. The dinner menu isn't huge but there's enough options and there are numerous cafes and restaurants within walking distance. Old Man's Beach is a five minute walk and the pub there is a good spot for a drink and a meal in an unbelievably relaxed atmosphere. All in all we couldn't rate the Kirana higher and fully intend to visit there again in the future. P.S. Best Free WiFi we've ever found anywhere!",

              "text": "Me and my boyfriend have stayed in the Kirana for 9 nights. When we have arrived we received a complementary drink. The manager explained everything to us. The biggest advantage of this hotel is the staff. No where else in the world I have met such a nice personnel.  \n\nThe hotel is very new. We have stayed in the pool access suite. It was very specious with a large living room, bedroom and bathroom. We were expecting that it might be loud since the pool was next to the suite but it was the total opposite. The bed was extremely comfortable.\n\nThe restaurant serves three types of breakfast. Which are very diverse. The dinner menu is delicious especially the spring rolls. Great selection of cocktails. \n\nThe spa is great value for money. Very professional. There is a large selection of massage oils and body scrubs. Tea is served after the massage.\n\nThe Kirana is about 20km away from Kuta. I think the location in which the hotel is, is ideal. The taxi to Kuta costs about 100K rupee but a drop off service from the hotel is avialable at 10am and 2pm to Seminayak. It is a great gateway from the tourist areas such as Kuta or Legian but those areas are still easily accessible.",

Staff at the front desk was very helpful from the check in on and throughout the whole stay. Good basic breakfast with a choice of American, Indonesian or Kirana Special. Batu Bolong beach is about 5 min walk away from the hotel. Its a black sand beach and unfortunately has a bit of rubbish around. There are a few nice coffee shops and restaurant down the road form the hotel (check out the French patisserie). The hotel offers free bike hire which is great to explore the surroundings. Also the hotel offers a free drop off only transfer to Seminyak which is about 20-30min drive away depending on the traffic. The Kirana is a nice place for a few relaxing and quiet days away.",

              "text": "We started our holiday around Bali here for 3 nights. Very friendly staff and a very helpfull hotel manager who welcomes her new guests and gives you all the information you need. The hotel is a 5min walk of canngu beach, where you have some Nice restaurants/bars. The beach however has few facilities and black sand. Canggu is ideal for a few days, especially if you want to (try) surf, but that's it.\n\nWe Had an ocean view room which was Nice and clean with a good bed. The bathroom however was less clean and our toilet was not working properly. They fixed it when we complained about it though. For the breakfast you can choose between american, indonesion or kirana special, basically they're all pretty much the same ( eggs, toast, fruit, juice,..) so not much variaty, which is ok if you don't stay too long like us.\n Nice extra's: free bicycle use(upon availability), free transfer to seminyak (only drop-off).  \n\nConclusion: in general a good hotel, if you don't pay more than \u20ac50/night and wouldn't recommend to stay longer then a few days.",

The beach gives the option of surfing for all levels. The rooms in the hotel are clean and neat with a good wifi connection. The staff is very professional and friendly. We allmost ever eat at the hotel restaurant, because the food there is delicious. The only downside is the bathroom floor, which did allways get flooded if you took a shower and did not drain. But overall it was a perfect relaxing stay.",

We were collected from the airport by the hotel's car, quite a relief given the uncertainty of trying to get a taxi. A beautiful eternity pool, free wifi and delicious food. Also, it's a short walk to the beach, where you can surf or swim, or just relax with a nice drink or some food at the lovely little cafe beside it. Two minor criticisms, the window in the bathroom, you are on view to anyone in your main room area. There is a curtain but it doesn't give much privacy at all. Unnecessary feature. Secondly, rather loud music blaring out a few mornings from the dining area, could hear it quite clearly in my room, even though I requested a quiet room. I don't mind a bit of music, but Lady Gaga pumping at 7 am was a little too much. But other than that I would highly recommend staying here. The staff are extremely helpful and so polite and friendly, they made our stay wonderful. There is also a spa facility within the hotel, offering massages and treatments. I never tried it but my partner said it was fantastic, and really cheap. I would definitely stay here again.",

The only thing that was a little annoying, was about the musiclist in the resturant, it was the same songs all over, and if you live in a poolacces the music is a little high in the mornings.

              "text": "We stayed 5 nights at the Karana in Canggu it was such a nice change from UBUD's bustling town centre.  The staff at the Karana were very friendly especially SRI she organised a special suprise for my birthday which made my stay extra special.  The food was okay more selections would of been better my husband and I are foodies so our expectations are a lot higher as we value nourishing the body with good food and nourishing the outside of your body too.  The Spa looked very nice on arrival the view from spa was awesome you could see a clear view of the beach.  The treatment was okay again we had previously had some of the best spa treatments in UBUD before we came to the Karana so again we felt the spa needed further training with regards to their technique and smoothness.  The pool was very nice it's right in the middle of all the accomodation.  The shuttle bus to Seminyak is an awesome addition the driver knows the back streets so it was such a nice relief to get away from the busy traffic. We stayed in the suite room, it was very nice, nice and spacious. Great size bathrooms, very comfortable beds and yes amazing pillows!!!! One little recommendation is supply a wardrobe to put your clothing in would of made it excellent!!!! Overall great place to stay, there were so many great little places to eat in walking distance to the resort that are worth just to stay in Canggu area!!!! Nice hotel I would definately come back there!!!",

The value for money at this hotel is outstanding.  The spa staff were excellent and also good value - my skin is still happy two weeks post facial.  The only thing to watch for is that the rooms have very little space so you virtually can't unpack.  Not a big deal all in all - just pack lightly. I'd highly recommend a few nights at The Kirana.",

The pool is really nice, staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, rooms are rather clean and the price is good, as we paid about 35 $ per person per night. We have also booked a wonderful massage at the hotel. The breakfast could use some quality improvents. Other than that, we were very happy with our stay. The beach is in 5 min walking distance, as well are nice restaurants and shops close by. One has to get used to walking on the road since there are no pedestrian walkways like anywhere in bali.",

The room clean and well appointed. wifi was really weak in my first floor room so I upgraded by $10 and moved poolside which was nicer and had great signal! It's one of the best locations and close to all the best hangs and the beach. It's not a big hotel so has a nice vibe.",

We had a pool room which meant we had easy access and used it every day. The staff are fantastic! Nothing is too much trouble. We enjoyed being able to walk down to Canggu beach and Echo beach. There are great places to eat and get great coffee within walking distance. My husband took advantage of the free hotel bikes and rode to Echo Beach a few times.",

The suite room is fantastic value for money. The staff are caring. It is a short walk to the surf beach & the hip Old Mans bar & restaurant and Kakilima by the Sea, Betelnut organic restaurant and a 5 minute drive to the famous Echo Beach. Very relaxing part of Bali we had a great time & the staff were fantastic with our small children. Thank you Kirana :)",

I stayed for two nights in the deluxe room with seaview, the bed was huge and very comfortable, lots of pillows, big balcony, good roomservice. In the bathroom you find shampoo, bodylotion, toothbrush and all the other stuff you need. Towels and sheets smelled very nice. And I really liked the design of the room and bathroom. The hotel itself has a very nice design, the restaurant is next to the pool with view to the ricefields. The food is also very good. The staff is just superfriendly and helpfull. They really try to make every wish possible, I even got a welcome massage after check in and a free bike after check out while waiting for my ride to the airport a few hours later. They have a very nice spa with relaxing treatments in a comfortable atmosphere. So I really enjoyed my stay here, wish I could have stayed longer.",

Otherwose there isnt much to do there. walking distance from the beach, and there are a lot of cafes nearby. Also it's close to an amazing bar and restaurant calles old man.\n\nrooms: were very clean, wished they were a little bigger though. \n\nService:  I would say its the best thing about this hotel. the staff were very polite and understanding. They even let us change our booking date without any fees! We also got a complimentary foot massage upon our arrival! And one day we had to leave the hotel v. Early in the morning so we requested if we can have our breakfast before the time it was served, and they helped us out!\n\nValue: we got a great deal from booking.com we also requested an extra bed which was only 20$ per night including breakfast! Amazing deal!",

Room is all adequate, pool is great, simple.. and there are not many people so its just nice. Its quiet and the greenery around makes it exclusive. good value for money if you get the deals on booking.com! Will definitely stay again and recommend it for all. Even families love it with the rooms just next to pool.  \n\nOne tip for Kirana, Can you pls add small towels/ hand towels in your bathroom pls ? You only have bath towels.",

The Kirana calls itself a four star hotel I can tell you it is nothing of the sort.\n\nThe staff are very friendly and great however the hotel is quite dated and doesn't have the four start standards in place (staff, facilities, quality). The bathroom has flies all over the place its disgusting.\n\nThe location is very good and central enough to a number of restaurants that is the only positive.\n\nThey had a rainstorm during my stay and the water went through the roof so the entire hotel had water all over the place. I went to my room and there is water all over the room floor and bathroom floor this was not great to come back to. When I complained and asked for another room they said there is nothing they can do about it. I would not stay here again.",

The room was nice and clean and everything in working order. Staff were also extremely friendly and helpful with any queries. The hotel is well located - the beach is not even a 5 minute walk and lots of shops, places to eat and spas outside your door. I could not fault it in any way.  It is not a 5 star hotel and was never advertised to be but it\u2019s a great hotel in its class. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would definitely consider the Kirana for any future travel. It was great!",

The location is perfect and close to everything, 5 mins walk to the beach, old mans and the lawn. Spa service was fantastic. The staff were amazing, always smiling and making sure you have a good stay. I loved spending my time with them at the reception. Booked a suite room in my first visit and stayed for 3 nights and after my 2 days trip to nusa penida i booked the suite again. The rooms are big and very spacious. Comfortable beds. Shout out to the reception staff. Lovely stay and will book again in my next trip",

Unfortunately near the hotel is a reconstruction going on, so the surrounding is due to this not so nice. The hotel offers 3 kinds of breakfast which is average. Near the hotel is a supermarket and money change, which is good. And also a few minutes walk is a very nice yoga studio Serenity. If you want to stay a few nights in Canggu this is a good choice. ",

              "text": "We booked this as the last leg of our wedding anniversary. I hate having to give a negative review but I hope my feedback can help this place to improve cause I see the potential but can\u2019t justify the price we ended up paying for such place.\n\nWe stayed in a Kirana room on the first floor at the end of Nov 2019 for 4 nights. \n\nPros: \n- Awesome Location. It\u2019s about a 5-7 min walk to Batu Bolong beach along with many restaurants, cafes and beach clubs along the way \n\n- Food options were cooked to perfection at the Kirana. For a set breakfast menu, everything was always cooked well and well presented. The mixed satay on the all day dining menu was also delicious \n\n- Security and Staff were all round kind \n\n- The Kanaya spa located on level 3 of the Kirana gave a good full body massage service\n\nCons:\n- Rooms were run down. I happened to scratch my leg on a nail that was sticking out of the side wood frame of the bed\n\n- Bathroom appears dirty (mirror mould, what seems to be permanent yellow marks on the inside rim of toilet seats) \n\n- TV was fuzzy when we first arrived. I ended up telling the front desk about this and they sent their maintenance man to work on it which he did eventually fix after some time\n\n- The website mentions hairdryer as one of their amenities on their website. You need to request this from reception as it appears it\u2019s either shared by all guests or they forgot to include one in our room. \n\n- The Kirana shampoo & conditioner and body wash was very watery, it was no point of even using it\n\nSome other minor observations: \n- Guests had to walk to the front reception each time they wanted to get a towel for the pool which was inconvenient. I feel something like this could easily be improved just by where you store your towels or procedure to provide one \n\n- Went to use the single treadmill at the gym but it was busted. Went for a jog around the block instead \n\nOverall I feel there needs to be a proper audit or review of the rooms and amenities by management of this place to be considered as a 4 star standard. \n\n ",

After paperwork and welcome drinks, a young petite lady came to help us with the heavy luggages. I ended up moving the luggages to the room myself as I saw the lady having a hard time carrying down just that few steps from the reception. Not forgetting that we had to push our luggages up a steep slope later on to get to the lobby. It was horrible. Don\u2019t understand why the guys couldn\u2019t do the work. \n\nRoom is below average. Bed is ok. Air con produce some weird sweat smell. Poor maintenance. Toilet drainage sucks. Thankfully there is good hot showers. There is a ventilation fan but toilet is just too smelly. No hair dryer. WIFI sucks max. Ground level rooms have to use restaurant WiFi which were super weak or hard to connect.\n\nWe made a mistake by booking the room beside the swimming pool because we have people dragging beach chairs early in the morning and people swimming at night.  And the room isn\u2019t so sound proof because there is a lot of gaps at the door. You can clearly hear your neighbours\u2019 conversations. Not very relaxing. So if you want to avoid that, please take rooms on higher floors.\n\nFor breakfast, we asked whether we could have it in the room. There is no consistency in their service. The guy staff told us we could not but the lady staff later told him say we could. And she offered to bring breakfast to our room. I forgot her name but great job! Small gesture goes a long way. But my goodness, the guy staff there are just plain lazy. Anyway, the breakfast was good. Only best thing we enjoyed during the stay. \n\nI applaud for all the female staff there as they are so friendly and helpful. We always return to the same accommodation when we visit Bali but sorry we are not coming back to this hotel. \n\nThanks and all the best. ",

Many of the lights didn't work in the room (flickered, or were out all together). View was disappointing..cranes and construction. Bathroom was disgusting. Shower doesn't seal shut, so water gets everywhere when you shower. Not enough towels to wipe it all up. Toilet was gross..not very clean. Definitely didn't use the tub..ew. Basically the bathroom was the quality I would expect at a motel or worse.\n\nBreakfast was actually good, but we ended up leaving a day early. Lost some money on that, but we didn't want to spend another night at the Kirana.",

We booked two 60-min massages and two pedicures right away. We were so impressed with our experience at the Kirana that we booked massages for the next day as well! \n\nTraditional Balinese massage technique paired with clean and professional spa room for a fantastic price (120,000 IDR special for 60 min massage!) \n\nAfter the spa treatments we took a quick dip in the pool and enjoyed a drink from the outdoor bar which furthered our sense of relaxation. Blissful.",

We could see the beach from our room and it was in a great spot. 7 minute walk to the beach and the cafes around were pretty good. We ate at In the raw garden cafe for one meal each day which was 2 minutes down the road. We were very happy with our stay here. ",

I booked a suite and the room is great in size with a balcony over the pool. I would ask for a room on the pool level next time. Service is great and breakfast is awesome. Only flaw is WiFi is hopeless with drop outs and speed and the couch in my room is coming covered in stains with is actually disgusting and out of character for the rest of the hotel. I would however recommend.",

The swimming pool wasn\u2019t very inviting but the worst part of the stay (even following an earthquake) when i had $300 AUD stolen from my room.  When I reported this to management i saw a list of about 12 other guests on the reception desk that had also made police reports.  I felt very unsafe and management were not very helpful so decided to leave this review rather than place myself at risk in a foreign country making a police report (in the managers company). There was only key access to my room and only cleaning staff had a key.  I definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend this place.  I love Bali and I have never felt so unsafe.",

The location was really great - a few minutes walk from the beach, across the street from a Yoga place and surrounded by a lot of restaurants. \nThe room was okay.  There was a TV in the 'living room' and in the bedroom, and a small balcony.  To be honest, there was a chair a couch in the 'living room' but they were very stained and we weren't altogether comfortable sitting on them. Other than that it was fine.  The breakfast was just okay, with a 4-5 choices, I think.  By booking online we got a free dinner at the restaurant and that was very good, although it was the only dinner we had there.\nThere was a small pool which was popular but we didn't use it.  The most unfortunate thing was the very poor wifi. Also they advertised a gym online, but it was basically non-existent.\nThe staff were very friendly and accommodating.  The ladies working the breakfast shift were really great.",

We really liked the facilities and the massages are also quite good. The pool was exactly as we expected and the staff is very friendly and helpful. Even if it's located in one of the main roads of Canggu, it's super quiet, so is perfect.\nOnly points to improve would be the breakfast and the WiFi: The breakfast is quite complete but not the best. WiFi was also a bit poor, but please expect this across most hotels in Indonesia.\nOverall, we would stay again in the Kirana Hotel!!",

Bed large and comfortable. Bathroom hasn\u2019t been maintained for a while. It really looks like no one look after daily cleaning.Woodend\nflorborboards in front of our suite and around swimming pool are seriously dangerous!\nYou have to be careful not to stub your toes against the timber floor!\nThe only positive thoughts are about the very good, close to the beach location.

Many good restaurants very close tho the hotel.\nPoolarea nice and clean. The included breakfast was good and with many choices, overall the restaurant was super - food was well cooked and many choices on the a la carte menu. The staff was friendly and effective, and checkin done fast and with relevant information given. Everything was clean and tidy. The massage service in the hotel was also to be recommended. The hotel also offers transfer to the airport on your order. Bigger shops and shops with international brands was not in the area, but smaller local shops was available. Surfschool very close on the beach 5 min away on foot. I can only strongly recommend the place, and I will be happy to come back.",

              "text": "We were in a second-floor room with a balcony overlooking the pool. The room was a good enough size for two people, with a well-appointed bathroom and a comfortable, large bed. The wardrobe was pretty large, but one of the doors was a bit wobbly which meant care needed to be taken to ensure the internal light went off - otherwise it cast a light across the room at night. We had a small fridge and a TV with a lot of channels - there was always something to watch if it was a little too warm outside... \n\nThe food was consistently good, the staff were lovely and everything worked as it should. The only downsides really were that there were some works going on during our stay, but the staff were good at keeping us informed of a few times when the hot water was turned\noff while work was completed and such. This all happened during the day when we were out exploring the beaches, bars and cafes in Canggu so didn't worry us at all. There is a bar, but it's not really a place you'd lounge and spend an evening - there are too many better places nearby for that. For the odd beer, while sat around the pool, it was great.\n\nThings which could improve things a touch? Only one chair on the balcony (had to take the one from the dresser out there), only two small cans of beer in the fridge (there was room for four!) There were a few little maintenance issues (flooring in the restaurant was a bit loose, door handle was a bit clunky) that should be tidied up. Otherwise though, a great value, well-located base in Canggu.",

              "text": "Apparently based on past reviews about the hotel's aging infrastructure, there was renovation happening during our stay here. The hotel informed us about this before our arrival, and the daytime renovation didn't really affect our stay.\n\nThe room we stayed in was clean and very comfortable. The balcony doors had gaps in them, but the hotel fogs for mosquitos so we didn't have any insect problems. The only complaint is that the shower water smells like sulfur for a few moments when the water is first turned on. But being on a volcanic island, perhaps this is normal?\n\nBreakfast was included and the food is delicious, and the choices very varied for a hotel breakfast. Their Western breakfast items were better than the Indonesian choices -- enjoy Indonesian cuisine at far superior restaurants elsewhere in the area. The staff were universally friendly and kind.\n\nDespite all of this, we did have some items stolen from the safe, which we've read can be rather common in Bali. We had set aside an exact amount of money in the beginning of our trip in a separate envelope for an activity we had booked. On the evening of our second day, we came back to our room to discover that the the safe door would no longer open (we didn't forget the password -- we set it as a personally memorable password). After asking the staff to help us open the safe while we were present, we discovered a portion of our money was missing, which we confirmed after calculating all of our expenses.\n\nWhile the hotel staff was kind and explained all of their safe procedures transparently, they didn't seem too convinced that our money was missing (the amount, while significant in rupiahs, wasn't so much as to attract attention if we hadn't known the exact amount in that envelope). There was no CCTV in the hallways or outside the balcony so the staff had no way of telling if anyone entered our room besides housekeeping. They were also adamant that us being unable to open the safe after returning to the hotel that evening was just a fault of the device, and not indicative of any possible break in. We were even told that safe \"errors\" occur quite commonly in the hotel, due to their aging safes. \n\nWhile we cannot blame the hotel or any specific staff member, the Kirana should really consider installing CCTV cameras in the hallways because this doesn't infringe on guest privacy, but still allows them to keep track of who enters the rooms.\n\nWhile this doesn't detract from an otherwise great stay, it would be advisable that guests to Bali always be aware exactly how much money is kept aside in hotel safes, as it seems like theft is done in small enough amounts to often times go unnoticed.",

Scratches on the floor and the shower had a distinct stench. This is supposed to be the best room in the hotel and it was run down. \n\nAlso, the wifi didn\u2019t work well in the penthouse. \n\nWe asked to get it fixed but nothing was done. We had to go downstairs to access the wifi, which sucks for a hotel in 2017. \n\nTo end things off the check out girl was pretty rude. Anna I think it was. It was at 1pm on November 26 so whoever that was she wasn\u2019t a fun experience to deal with. \n\nOverall, I\u2019m sad to write this. We had a great experience 2 years ago but quality went down real fast. \n\nPs. They also said they\u2019d transport us to our next destination in Canggu but tried to get us to take a taxi despite saying they would transport us. \n\nI was pretty tired of dealing with the girl so I was about to just get a taxi but they ended up driving us in the end (with much conflict). Keep this in mind if you want transport from kirana. ",

I stayed here to review the spot, and see if I would suggest bookings for clients. Short story, I would NOT! \n\nWhile the staff was very friendly, this ended up not being sufficient enough to overcome what the resort lacks. The property is outdated, and although they are starting to do some renovations, you will also have to deal with the construction noise (supposedly done around May2018). \n\nIt does have a good location in Canggu and right on the Main Street, so walking is easy to restaurants, beach, and bars. \n\nIf I were to give a value to this resort, I would say guests should not pay over $30 Per night. But regularly twice if not three times as much. \n\nI will not be staying here again. ",

The pool is nice and kind of protected from the noise of the road by the hotel's design, though you can hear people in and around it in the evening. This wasn't a big deal and they have hours when ppl aren't supposed to be out there. But the thing that is really great about the Kirana is the staff. Everyone I interacted with was kind and fun--as though they really enjoyed being there and what they were doing. Either they were genuinely happy or they fake it well. The spa is fantastic and the staff there are especially great. The location is pretty nice, too, in that you can easily walk to restaurants, bars and shopping, and of course the beach.",

There are pro's and con's to this little boutique hotel and it does feel as if it was built quickly and rushed to get opened.  \n\nPro's: the incredible staff. They were all so friendly and accommodating and did their absolute best to attend to any issues and offer help and assistance when needed. I can't speak highly enough about the staff at The Kirana. I've travelled a lot, and they were definitely some of the most friendly and helpful. The breakfast was great and the hotel is in a great (if not, perfect) location. \n\nCon's: We had a few issues which included the toilet not working, the air conditioner didn't seem to really work despite being left on at 18 degrees, the shower pressure was not great (I wasn't able to wash the shampoo out of my hair properly) and the hotel is in need of a thorough deep clean and maintenance.  \n\nAll in all, you get what you pay for and for the good price, this is definitely a good choice when staying in Canggu.

The massages were great, they thought it was hilarious that my father in law enjoyed his massage so much that he promptly fell asleep and snored the whole way through. We visited multiple times, I recommend you book, they were busy, but with Canggu growing they\u2019ll get even busier.",

Feels expensive, unfortunately the inside disappoints\n\nRoom 207:\n-shower smells of sewage once the water is on \n-aircon started leaking water onto the floor and kept switching off at night despite there not being any switch off timer setting in place\n-many Mosquitos In toilet and in the room, despite the balcony door being closed\n-got stuck in lift due to a power failure\n-ocean view from 207 isn't really a direct view. You have to exit to the balcony and look 90 degrees left to see the lovely ocean. This privilege will be extinguished soon as a new hotel coming up will likely obstruct your view \n-breakfast is decent, but they should make fresh juices instead of serving concentrated bitter packed ones. Afterall, everyone else in canggu is competiting with their own fresh juice concoctions \n-wifi is dreadfully slow. It's surely not due to the location, as old mans bar and grocer& grind on the echo beach side have fast wifi\n\nThis place is an ok choice if you grab it on a good discount. Full price would not be justifiable.",

Unfortunately this time the bathroom was much more aged and unclean (what a shame we were too scared to use the bath cause there were stains).\n\nWhen we were leaving in a \"grab taxi\" as the price was 1/5th of the price offered by local cab drivers. the staff at the Kirana alerted the local group of taxi drivers who threatened two of the cab drivers we ordered until they cancelled our bookings. The local cab drivers then threatened us with violence unless we took their cabs meanwhile the staff at the Kirana sat idle. I'm shocked to be treated this way. I respect the need to support local economies but when you charge people extortionate rates simply for being a tourist and then threaten them with violence it goes a bit far.\n\nThe Kirana were completely complicet in this racket, even putting us in harms way by alerting the local cab drivers in the first place.",

              "text": "It is a terrible review, but the truth needs to be told. \n\nWhile the hotel has a special offers page. On checking out you find that the special offer does not apply in \"high season\" Despite being told at reception when booking (and paying the non refundable deposit) it does apply. \n\nhttp://www.thekiranabali.com/special-offers.php?#hotel-in-bali-special-offers\n\nIssue 1. - We book the penthouse for 2 nights, Love it and request it for 5 more based on the websites pay 3 stay 4. At reception I am shown a calculator with the price per night based on the stay 4 pay 3. I accept this, hand over my credit card and they take payment and issue me a credit card receipt only. Just before checking out I find out this rate has not been applied, But a \"special rate\" which was a normal rate with a 2 course dinner thrown in.\n\nOn reporting this I am told I should have calculated the payment myself on the bill before paying, I inform the manager I was not given a bill, only shown the rate on a calculator after showing his staff the price listed on the website and I am told I should have asked for the itemised bill. \n\nFYI, As I type this the internet still says stay 7 pay 6 - FYI we are on day 11. I have attached a photo so if the website gets changed you will know. \n\nIssue 2. Still thinking we have a great rate we decide to stay, this time in a suite as the penthouse is booked. Going for breakfast I ask reception if the suite is free and am told it is for another week, I ask them to reserve it and am told they will. I go to breakfast, come back, go to reception and am told \"sorry sir it is booked\"\n\nIssue 3. I accept 2 nights in a suite and 1 night in a standard room, I am told the standard room is $100. I tell them I have seen it is cheaper on the internet (which is not working at that time in the hotel) and ask for the internet rate. Reception makes a call and says \"yes sir $90\" I accept make payment then head to a cafe to use the internet. I find the advertised rate is $63.\n\nIssue 4, I tell them I am moving out because the internet doesn't work and the room we are moving to in 2 days is not suitable. We get told the penthouse has been cancelled and is available. We are given another \"special rate\" including massages and the difference in price. On the phone I confirm the rate twice \"so it is roughly US$100 on what we have paid\" \"Yes Sir\", and I confirm once. \"is the massage for 2 people\" \"Yes Sir\". We agree and move rooms.\n\nIssue 5, We get an invoice for US$260 as the difference in room rates. \n\nI report this difference immediately and the manager tells me she was standing next to the girl on the phone and the price was quoted and the massage was for one person  I explain that I clearly asked the question on the difference in price and also confirm the massage, She does not respond. - So why didn't the manager deal with the issue herself? If she had she would have heard my very specific and clear questions.  \n\nIssue 6. I did not receive a bill until I asked for an itemised account. This is when I discovered the stay 1 night free did not apply. \n\nThe resident Manager Komang Sri Dewi was useless. She would only communicate through her manager (who for most of this would only communicate through his manager, who by the way WAS STANDING NEXT TO THE RECEPTIONIST when she was confirming the US$100 difference and then emailed me the higher bill.\n\nThe resident manager according to the (middle) manager apparently takes the managers wages if they don't collect the full amount of money - So apparently its ok for them to steal my money or the staffs. \n\nThe staff were friendly unfortunately because of the issues I can only rate the place as terrible. \n\nTheir response to my complaint when I found out (on the second last day) what we were being charged (ripped off). Pay or get out. So we are leaving.",

My wife asked for towels for pool at bar next to pool and was told by 3 staff standing around that she has to get from reception 50m walk to reception then back to pool... That's not good service .. Actually had 2 star accommodate on this .. Very poor training \nI push bikes were old and rusty and bathroom told stained. Shuttle was full each day and asked for a taxi which would cost $5 though told us that only hotel car was available at $10 though we had taxi pick us up before from same area in Canggu. Also was told I had to pay driver cash which is dodgy as I thought it would go onto the bill as paying via MasterCard at end of stay!",

The place was essentially new, with groovy modern architecture.\n\nPros\n- easy walking distance from the beach\n- beach at the end of the road is amazing for learners/long boarders, and intermediate/advanced surfers can find good waves a short walk over the point\n- Cool grubby boho pubs at the beach are fun and popular\n- Canggu has more of a laid back hippy vibe than busier places to the south\n- slick clean comfortable new rooms. \n- front desk staff are super helpful and capable\n- bikes free to use\n- coffee was excellent\n- free wifi worked ok most of the time\n- some cool eateries within walking distance\n\nCons\n- we found the surf obscenely crowded\n- as previous reviewers noted, common areas lack a little atmosphere\n- single albums seemed to go on repeat for most of the day, drove us a bit mad as our room was in earshot\n- tight hotel footprint meant not much room around the pool. Getting to our room with luggage meant virtually bumping our way through sun bathers. \n- no shade over any part of the pool prevented me spending as much time in there as I would have liked. \n- food and menu was pretty standard stuff but well priced\n- the day spa was also a pretty standard offering",

Service with a smile, well serviced room every day, organised dinners and transport promptly.\n\nBreakfast was average but lucky for us 'Monsuir Spoon' and 'Grocer and Grind' are a short walk and provide a fantastic breaky and beat coffee in Bali.\n\nOnly lost 2 stars, one for not cleaning the pool side sun beds (stained, dirty and quite sandy) you should consider dry cleaning or replacing and giving them a wipe down twice a day.\n\nThe other star was lost for not having any sparkling wine and refusing to get any when it's on your menu. We stayed for 8 days and I was asking for sparkling wine on our first day. if sparkling wine is to difficult to stock you should remove it from your menu so as not to disappoint future guests. \n\nThey make a good cocktail but a slow one. Loved the idea of the courtesy bike but they only had 3 and they were always out... 6-8 would be a better number to have.\n\nNice place to stay if you hate the hustle and bustle of Bali with more than enough cafes, restaurants, bar and shops to amuse yourself.",

The hotels pool is lovely, they could perhaps a few more loungers but space around the pool is limited. \n\nBreakfast at they hotel was excellent and prepared to order, in the evening  there was a good range of choices on the menu at a reasonable price and  we had eat here about 4 times over our two week stay and all meals were very good. \n\nAll the staff in the hotel were wonderful, attentive, friendly, efficient they really did help to make this hotel special.\n\nMy wife and I are well past the age of surfing but found much to enjoy in this low key resort. The hotel is a short distance from the beaches. There are several good restaurants within walking distance of the hotel and prices are often very cheap compared with the UK and all the meals we had were very good, we like eating local foods but there were also plenty of western style choices. There are also some nice small upmarket clothing shops opening up in the area.\n\nWe did some day trips out using the hotel driver and car - ten - eleven hour day touring  for  75 Dollars. Could probably get it cheaper but driver was excellent and cars  new and comfortable.\nIf you want  low key tourism this is an ideal location, the hotel looks out over rice fields.\nDue to its location this hotel will obviously appeal to surfers but  those who are not surfers will find much to enjoy\n\nWe had a lovely two weeks here and  would very much hope to return. A really relaxing location.",

Our room was located on the 3rd floor and had a great view towards the sea. You could see clearly it\u2019s a relatively new hotel. We had a nice comfortable bed and large television with a lot channels. The pool is not so big, but I guess most people who visit this area will go to the beach anyway. The beach is not far from the hotel. It\u2019s more quite compared to Seminyak or Kuta and has good surfing possibilities. Another thing we really like was the gym. It\u2019s not that big but has all necessary equipment for the sportive amongst us. We didn\u2019t try the spa, but we assume it\u2019s as good as the rest of the hotel. The restaurant is good, but the menu is not so big. This not a real problem because there are so many good restaurants in the area. The hotel can arrange scooters for rent, which is the best way to go around in this area. Canggu is a rather large area and the distance is a bit far to cover all on foot. It\u2019s perfect for people who want to avoid the chaos around Kuta and Seminyak. Compared to other hotels from the same range in the area the price is really good. If we come back to Canggu, we\u2019ll stay here again for sure.",

When we arrived the welcome from the staff was very warm with a welcome drink. In the hotel is a spa with really fair prices. The hotel restaurant offers delicious menus for good prices. The hotel is located 5 min from the beach (surf beach, not really for swimming due to high waves). There are other restaurants in walking distance. The hotel offers free bicycles for rent also. I really loved the location cause it's away from the stress, crowds and noise in Denpasar. \n\nWe really recommend the hotel to anyone who wants a relaxed holiday, you have everything you need in the hotel. \n\nWe will be back definitely cause it was really relaxing. \n\nPro:\nquiet location\nvery good condition (built in Nov 2013)\nvery clean\nlovely and warm staff\neverything you need is onsite \nnice pool \nnice spa\n\nCons:\nnone :)",

              "text": "It\u00b4s experiences like this that makes me happy, that I usually only pre book one night at a hotel, in order to see if its a place I want to spend more nights. In this case it wasn\u00b4t, actually I couldn\u00b4t get away from there quick enough! The hotel is new and generally nicely built but with a few architechtural flaws in my opinion. In example the gym built on 1st floor blocking the seaview from the balconies. If it wasn\u00b4t for the staff, the hotel would have good potential. I was traveling with an Indonesian friend and was horrified to see how the staff addressed her, especially the waiter in the restaurant who was extremely condescending and patrionizing towards her unless westerners were with her. It is shameful having staff acting like this and made our stay very uncomfortable. So my advise is to not go here if you want to have a holiday where you want to be treated nice and  equally. Furthermore we were told when checking in that breakfast was served until 11 a.m. but when we arrived at 10.42, we were told that breakfast was over. When complaining about this they acknowledged they might have given us wrong information, but not even a simple apology was given, which would have been the least they could do. So the conclusion of our stay is that we didn\u00b4t get what we paid for - only bad service from an incompetent and rude staff that are clearly not trained to work in the hotel business.",

Superb views of the ocean and beautiful rice fields in one of the best central locations in Bali.Peaceful and only 20 mins from Seminyak by complimentary shuttle that runs twice a day. Airports transfers provides for stays 4 days and longer . Perfectly clean and hotel build and fittings in general are of a much higher quality than normally found in Bali . Unobtrusive professional 24 hr security ensured peace of mind .Relaxing infinity type pool surrounded by decking and lounges that gets sun all day long was my personal favourite. Only a 5 min walk to Bali's famous west coast surf beaches that stretch for miles and are far cleaner than Kuta and Legian. Complimentary breakfast was included and restaurant serve up tasty meals all day anytime until 10pm . Also Canngu in general has many great relaxed cafes, restaurants and bars . Have to say that what really made my stay was the staff, a refreshingly happy fun bunch of people that provided service with a smile , yet were relaxed , low key and great to have a laugh and a chat with . Thanks Guys and Girls ! . Shaun.",

In het hotel zelf hebben we geen last gehad van geluidsoverlast van de straat. Het was erg rustig op de kamer. \n\nOnze douche had een grote regendouche kop en een sproeier. Alleen de kleine sproeier werkte. Erg slecht.\n\nNaar mijn mening is de prijs te hoog voor de kwaliteit die je krijgt.\n\nPluspunt was het bed, deze was 200cm bij 200cm en sliep heerlijk. ",

Die Lage ist nicht direkt am Strand, jedoch ist man in ein paar Minuten zu Fuss am Strand. Wir haben an diesem Strand unsere 1. Surfestunden absolviert. Der Strand ist perfekt daf\u00fcr. Das Hotel liegt direkt an einer Strasse, in welcher es sehr viele gute Restaurants gibt. Auch f\u00fcr Vegetarier und Veganer hat es eine riesige Auswahl. Wir k\u00f6nnen das Hotel empfehlen.",

L\u2019h\u00f4tel n\u2019a pas tenu les promesses affich\u00e9es par les diverses commentaires et photos mises en avant. A commencer par cette piscine qui pourrait \u00eatre magnifique mais qui, de par sa vue sur un immeuble en construction (avec bruits de travaux en sus), ses lames en bois us\u00e9s par le soleil et l\u2019eau chlor\u00e9e, en fait une piscine sympathique tout au plus. La fa\u00e7ade de l\u2019h\u00f4tel montre des signes de fatigue et un ravalement aussi bien \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur ne ferait pas de mal. La chambre est plut\u00f4t sympa avec mini bar et coffre fort. La literie est correcte et la climatisation fonctionne parfaitement. Seul point \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer la salle de bain qui , a l\u2019image de la fa\u00e7ade de l\u2019h\u00f4tel, est fatigu\u00e9e.  Enfin le petit d\u00e9jeuner est plut\u00f4t bon, l\u00e0 dessus pas de mauvaise surprise. Donc pour conclure un \u00e9tablissement qui a tout pour \u00eatre top mais se g\u00e2che par une somme de d\u00e9tails. A vous de voir maintenant...",

Le reste presque froide.\n-Le plafond de la salle de bain est tomb\u00e9, fuite d\u2019eau et ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la premi\u00e8re car pourriture dans l\u2019assemblage plafond/plancher.\nOn dirait que l\u2019h\u00f4tel fait de la survie, patch et repatch, avec du cheap. Triste s\u00e9jour.\n",

Une mini rizi\u00e8re est entretenue entre la r\u00e9ception et le b\u00e2timent principal.\nLa piscine bien que pas tr\u00e8s grande est pratiquement d\u00e9serte. En 5 jours nous l'avons eu pour nous tout seuls \u00e0 presque tous les apr\u00e8s-midi.\nNous avions la suite 105 et c'\u00e9tait tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s grand.\n\nLes moins bons c\u00f4t\u00e9s:\nL'internet ne fonctionne pas bien et est tr\u00e8s al\u00e9atoire.\nL'h\u00f4tel est en r\u00e9novation majeure dans certaines chambres. \u00c7a fait de la poussi\u00e8re de travaux qui s'infiltre partout. Une attention particuli\u00e8re aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre port\u00e9e au m\u00e9nage mais ce ne fut pas le cas.\nIl y avait des fourmis dans la chambre.\nUn matin, le plafond s'est mis \u00e0 couler dans la salle de bain. Je suis partie un heure et quand je suis revenue il \u00e9tait tomb\u00e9.\u00a0 Heureusement ils ont pris \u00e7a en main rapidement et au retour de ma journ\u00e9e le plafond \u00e9tait r\u00e9par\u00e9.\u00a0\nL'eau chaude de la douche est comme l'internet c'est \u00e0 dire al\u00e9atoire\n\nL'h\u00f4tel en tant que tel est bien mais on dirait qu'il manque un peu d'amour. Et d'entretien. Exemple, deux renvois d'air climatis\u00e9 d\u00e9gouttent.... \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des chaises longues \u00e0 la piscine...\u00a0\n\nPour le prix (90$ CAD la nuit) je crois que c'est une coche en dessous.\n",

Bei dem Preis und der nahen Lage zum Strand in der Mainroad hatten wir eigentlich nicht so viel erwartet, wurden dann aber sehr positiv \u00fcberrascht. Der Pool ist auch super und die Massagen im hoteleigenen Spa-Bereich ein Traum. Einziges Manko: unser Zimmer war recht hellh\u00f6rig (1.Stock) und wir haben das Restaurant geh\u00f6rt, nachts war es aber ruhig und uns hatte das auch kein bisschen  gest\u00f6rt. Wir k\u00f6nnen das Hotel nur w\u00e4rmstens weiterempfehlen und werden bei unserem n\u00e4chsten Besuch in Canggu auf jeden Fall wieder dort unterkommen.",

Hotellfrukosten var trist, inte alls s\u00e4rskilt god. Gymmet \u00e4r pyttelitet och har v\u00e4ldigt lite utrustning. Wi-fi funkar ok p\u00e5 rummen, men ibland funderade det inte alls. Jag skulle kunna bo h\u00e4r igen, men det \u00e4r inget lyxhotell. ",

Die Bewertung bezieht sich darauf.\n\nZimmer ausreichend gro\u00df, gro\u00dfes Doppelbett und Bad mit Dusche und Badewanne.\nSauberkeit im Zimmer absolut in Ordnung.\n\nLeider hatten wir keine M\u00f6glichkeit, unsere nassen Sachen aufzuh\u00e4ngen (die oberen Zimmer konnten alles auf dem zugeh\u00f6rigen Balkon spannen). \n\nUnsere Klimaanlage tropfte teilweise, die Hotelmitarbeiter haben 3 Mal danach geschaut und jedes Mal gesagt, es w\u00e4re repariert - war es aber nie. Funktioniert hat sie dennoch. War nur etwas nervig, wenn man gerade darunter durch ins Bad lief und man dann einen kalten Tropfen abbekommen hat...\n\nDie Matratzen f\u00fcr die Liegen am Pool waren sehr fleckig. Ohne Handtuch wollte ich mich nicht darauf legen. Handt\u00fccher gab es f\u00fcr den Pool immer an der Rezeption - da hatten wir ab und an aber auch ein fleckiges dabei.\n\nK\u00fchlschrank ausreichend gro\u00df sodass wir auch unsere eigenen Getr\u00e4nke darin untergebracht haben.\n\nFr\u00fchst\u00fcck super - gibt zwar nur 3 Men\u00fcs, aber darunter kann man alles variieren. Verschiedene Sorten French Toast, Pancakes, Eier etc. Hat alles gut geschmeckt. Leider war der Saft aus dem Karton und es gab keine hei\u00dfe Schokolade - damit konnten wir uns aber abfinden.\n\nLeider haben viele Angestellte nicht gut Englisch gesprochen. Als wir Hilfe gebraucht hatten bei der SIM-Karte sind wir nicht weiter gekommen, weil niemand so gut Englisch gesprochen hat. M\u00fcssten dann zur\u00fcck ins Gesch\u00e4ft, damit der Verk\u00e4ufer uns hilft.\n\nLocation gut. Wir hatten einen Motorroller, was absolut notwendig war, um mehr als nur Canggu zu sehen.\nCanggu hat super Restaurants (Betelnut, Deus Ex Machina, Old Mans) in unmittelbarer N\u00e4he zum Hotel. Strand innerhalb weniger Minuten zu erreichen.\n\nMassagen in Ordnung. (Nicht zu vergleichen mit der Weltbesten Massage in Ubud!)\n\n",

Shuttle service naar Seminyak Square, alleen brengen, niet halen. Kamers zijn heerlijk, weinig privacy alleen bij het toilet vanwege het doorkijkraam. Faciliteiten in de kamer super: gratis water, koelkast, doucheschuim etc. (geen tandenborstel). Zwembad en de ligbedden zijn fantastisch: luxe. Het ontbijt is zeker de moeite waard: vooral de ciabatta met kip maar bovenal de muffins! Wauw. Wauw. Echt to-die-for. Haha! Wij zijn na 3 dagen verblijf nog een dag teruggegaan (stiekem voor de muffins). Nadeel? De Wifi is ontiegelijk traag, echt een misser! Daarnaast moet je voor alles eerst naar de receptie: handdoeken halen, sleutels van de fiets brengen en halen.... Op zich geen straf want super lieve mensen maar niet heel praktisch. De kamer met zeezicht is niet veel anders dan de andere kamers.De zee zie je in de verte maar niet veel bijzonders.rouwens erg dicht bij het strand, 5 min. lopen.  ALs ik terugkom in Bali, verblijf ik zeker weer bij The Kirana. Mits de muffins hetzelfde blijven ;).",

Bei Langzeitaufenthalten wie unserem wird das eigentlich ausgezeichnete Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck trotz auswahl zwischen drei Men\u00fcs mit der Zeit ein wenig fad (Drei Wochen lang immer wieder das gleiche...).\nDas Personal des Hotels ist sehr bem\u00fcht dem Gast jeden Wunsch recht zu machen. Ganz besonders PIAN, einer der Kellner, scheut keine M\u00fche und scheint jeden Gast pers\u00f6nlich zu kennen.\nDie Betten sind f\u00fcr Hotelma\u00dfst\u00e4be ein Traum! Gro\u00df, nicht zu weich nicht zu hart.\nIn n\u00e4herer Umgebung gibt es viele kleine Restaurants und Lokale die zu Fu\u00df gut zu erreichen sind. Besonders vorzuheben ist hier das Old Mans am Canggubeach, das le Pirate einen Strand weiter am Echobeach und eine kleine Franz\u00f6siche B\u00e4ckerei, Monsieur Spoon (F\u00fcr Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck au\u00dfer Haus). Etwas weiter Weg l\u00e4sst sich - einfach immer die Stra\u00dfe lang ins Landesinnere das Dandelion empfehlen.\nDer Pool des Hotels ist sehr klein und es gibt zu wenig Liegem\u00f6glichkeiten, das ist das einzige was negativ aufgefallen ist. Das Problem w\u00fcrde sich leicht l\u00f6sen lassen in dem man den gro\u00dfen Pool f\u00fcr die Familienzimmer f\u00fcr alle zug\u00e4nglich machen w\u00fcrde.",

Nos recibieron con un zumo de bienvenida delicioso y un masaje de pies de 15 minutos, adem\u00e1s nos ayudaron con el equipaje hasta nuestros aposentos. \nLa habitaci\u00f3n dispon\u00eda de todas las comodidades, y adem\u00e1s la cama era muy grande y c\u00f3moda. Ten\u00eda acceso directo a la piscina, que no era muy grande pero era muy bonita a pesar de no tener muy buenas vistas. \nLa comida exquisita, especialmente los platos t\u00edpicos.\nDispon\u00edan de alquiler de motos a muy buen precio, fuimos a la playa m\u00e1s cercana (2min en moto) que no nos gust\u00f3 mucho ya que parec\u00eda ser especial para surfistas, por lo que nos fuimos a la playa de Seminyak en motocicleta que era mucho mejor. \n\nA pesar de que el hotel y el servicio fue excelente la ubicaci\u00f3n no es para nada \u00f3ptima.",

La piscine est tr\u00e8s belle, quoique petite (c'est une piscine \u00e0 d\u00e9bordement). Le personnel est d'une incroyable gentillesse, ils sont vraiment l\u00e0 pour rendre votre s\u00e9jour agr\u00e9able ! Leur niveau d'anglais est largement suffisant, contrairement \u00e0 ce que je lisais dans un autre avis.\nB\u00e9mol sur le petit d\u00e9jeuner : il pourrait y avoir plus de choix et il manque vraiment un petit d\u00e9jeuner continental sucr\u00e9. Et de vrai caf\u00e9 !\nB\u00e9mol sur la zone g\u00e9ographique : le Kirana est VRAIMENT loin de tout. Voiture taxi ou scooter indispensable pour se d\u00e9placer en ville ou voir des monuments ou lieux culturels. \u00c0 noter que l'h\u00f4tel met en place une navette pour aller au centre de Seminyak, mais c'est aller simple : retour en taxi. Pr\u00e9voir son permis international est donc malin (et s'armer de courage pour affronter la conduite balinaise :P)\nLa plage est quant \u00e0 elle accessible \u00e0 pied en 5-6 minutes, MAIS c'est une plage de surfeurs (tr\u00e8s grosses vagues, difficile voire impossible de s'y baigner simplement). Et le sable y est volcanique : sable noir, colle encore plus \u00e0 la peau que le sable \"normal\", s'infiltre partout dans les maillots de bains. \u00c0 d'autres endroits de l'\u00eeles vous aurez des vraies plages paradisiaques.\nAu final, un tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s bel h\u00f4tel, tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able, tr\u00e8s bien entretenu, dans un endroit calme et d\u00e9paysant. Je recommande vraiment pour les s\u00e9jours de quelques jours (moins d'une semaine) ! Au del\u00e0 les b\u00e9mols deviennent un peu p\u00e9nibles.",
