Dapur dengan perlengkapan simpel. 2 lantai ( 1 kamar di atas 1 kamar dibawah) toilet luas dikedua kamar. Dilengkapi dengan bethub. Pelayanan sangat oke. Kami dapat free breakfast floating.\nYang perlu ditingkatkan (HARUS DIPERBAIKI) sarapan membosankana. 4x sarapan menu sama. Jadi yang hari terahir kami hanya request nasi putih (untung villa ini ada dapur dan lengkap dengan peralatan memasak)\n\nSangat rekomended utk kalian yg berlibur butuh ketenangan dan akses mudah. Apalagi kalian rombongan.",

Ternyata cuma dpt fruit basket, kasur tidak dihias bunga (saya rasa itu penting utk honeymoon). Romantic dinner cm didalam ruangan (meski memang ruangannya disamping kolam renang sih)",

Kalau lokasinya di depan jalan raya persis mungkin akan lbh baik lagi.. privacy antar villa terjaga. Saya penasaran dengan 2 bedroom nya.. semoga saya bisa membawa keluarga untuk berlibur dan stay disini kembali..",

Kami mendapat kolam pribadi, kamar mandi ganda, bak mandi cantik yang memanjakan Anda sepanjang malam, ruang tamu bagus untuk menikmati sarapan atau makan malam pribadi. Setiap kamar didesain untuk memuaskan tamu. Sangat nyaman. Jika Anda cukup malas untuk menarik tubuh Anda keluar vila, percayalah, Anda tidak akan bosan. Meski tidak ada pemandangan khusus dari kamar saya (Room I), tetapi kolam dan pohon kemboja sudah cukup untuk menghibur hari Anda. Menurut pendapat saya, vila ini cocok untuk Anda baik yang berpergian seorang diri, bersama keluarga, teman atau bahkan perjalanan bulan madu.\n\nStaf sangat peduli terhadap kebutuhan tamu. Meski sarapan mulai pukul 7 pagi, tetapi mereka menyanggupi untuk memberikan sarapan lebih awal karena kami harus meninggalkan vila segera menuju pelabuhan Gili Trawangan.\n\nTerima kasih banyak untuk mbak Nisa dari Bali Premier Management yang membawa kami ke vila ini dan membuat liburan kami lebih mudah dan nyaman, pengalaman yang sangat baik menginap di sini. Saya akan senang untuk kembali lagi dan merekomendasikannya pada teman-teman saya! Dan Bli Catur yang membantu kami dari The Jineng ke pantai Kuta untuk melihat parade kembang api.\n\nSecara keseluruhan, The Jineng adalah vila yang sangat baik. Terletak di Seminyak, cukup dekat untuk menemukan keramaian. Butuh waktu sekitar 15 menit untuk berjalan ke pantai Double Six atau 10 menit dengan mobil atau motor ke Kuta. Serius, saya akan senang untuk kembali lagi! :)",

Sebuah tumpangan menuju pantai menjadikan pagi yang luar biasa dan kemudian kembali ke vila untuk menyejukkan diri di kolam. Bantuan selalu tersedia. Sarapan luar biasa.

              "text": "Sayang menginap tanggal 23-25 Oktober di Villa E. Secara keseluruhan lumayan. \n\nPertama, desain villanya bagus dan modern tetapi kurang dan beberapa lampu tak bisa digunakan. mungkin, lampu-lampu itu hanya untuk dipajang. \n\nYang kedua, kedua toilet sangat bau. Ini adalah pengalaman terburuk yang pernah saya alami. Bahkan lebih buruk dari hotel murahan. Tempat ini sangat parah. \n\nKetiga, masalah nyamuk dan lipan sangat serius. Saya mulai membunuh nyamuk-nyamuknya ketika saya masuk villa hingga saya tak bisa menghitung berapa banyak yang sudah saya bunuh. Lipan-lupannya ada di sekeliling lantai di sebelah kolam renang. Saya merasa berenang dengan lipan di luar dan dalam kolam renang.\n\nKeempat, karyawan hotel betul-betul harus mempersiapkan krim penolak nyamuk di villa untuk memastikan masalah mengenai nyamuk dikurangi. Staf hotel juga harus menyediakan alat makan dan gelas minum yang bersih setelah mereka mengambil gelas-gelas dan peralatan makan kotor dari villa kami. \n\nKelima, persoalan sampah. Saya menemukan bahwa sampah-sampah masih di tempat semula pada saat kami melakukan check out tanggal 25. Sampah-sampah itu dibuang pada tanggal 23 malam, sedangkan kamar didatangai petugas pembersih kamar pada tanggal 24 sore. Saya jadi bertanya-tanya, apa yang dilakukan oleh petugas pembersih kamar, jika begitu? \n\nKeenam, sarapannya lumayan tapi tidak ada susu untuk teh dan kopi. Satu-satunya kotak tissue ada dii meja makan. Tidak di tempat tidur, dan yang terutama...tidak ada juga di kamar mandi.\n\nPintu kamar tidurnya TIDAK BISA DIKUNCI. Apakah menurutmu kami bisa tidur di malam hari? untuk 2 malam? Terima kasih untuk \"keramahtamahan luar biasa\" tetapi jangan lupa... SAYA MEMBAYAR UNTUK KERAMAH TAMAHAN YANG BAIK bukan untuk sesuatu seperti ini...",

              "text": "Saya mengharapkan saya membaca komentar terhadap Jineng sebelum memutuskan memilih villa ini dimana ini sudah saat terakhir saat pemesanan jadi kami tidak punya banyak waktu untuk memilih-milih dan kita diberikan penawaran yang sangat bagus-walaupun itu tidak berakhir dengan bagus. Kita tiba dan ditempatkan dalam Villa M saat malam tanggal 30 Sept 2012. Disana terdapat aroma yang sangat menusuk dari kamar mandi/toillet kamar master suite, jadi kami meminta untuk pindah ke villa lain yang sebelumnya kami diberitahukan boleh pindah pada hari berikutnya. Saat kami tiba dari Ubud saat siang hari kita menghitung uang yang kita letakan dibrankas dikamar. Sesuai janji kami pindah ke Villa B pada hari siangnya dan saat petang saat kami pergi mengambil uang kami dan kami menyadari uangnya hilang setengah-lebih dari 3 juta rupiah.\n\nSaya segera menginformasikan staff resepsionis yang kelihatannya tidak cukup peduli, bahkan tidak meminta maaf mewakili pihak villa. Saya berkeras agar mereka melaporkan hal ini pada polisi dan mereka melakukannya dengan enggan tapi karena sudah lewat pukul 5 sore, saya harus menunggu untuk menyelesaikannya di hari berikutnya. Manajer dan asistennya mengantar saya ke kantor polisi di kuta keesokan paginya di mana saya diberikan sebuah surat laporan untuk perusahaan asuransi perjanalan saya oleh polisi, tapi tetap saja saya tidak menerima permintaan maaf dari pihak Jineng dan sejak saat itu, peristiwa ini sama sekali tidak disebut-sebut lagi. Kami mencoba agar hal ini tidak merusak saat liburan kami tapi hal ini benar-benar sangat mengesalkan saya.\n\nVilla yang kami tempati sangat luas dan modern tapi wastafel kamar mandi di kamar tidur utamanya tidak berfungsi, tidak ada air dan toilet di lantai bawah berbau apak. Tidak ada teko di kamar dan lampu-lampu di lounge tidak dapat dinyalakan karena tidak ada soket untuk memasang mereka. Situsnya memasang bahwa ada kue-kue untuk malam hari dan penggantian seprai kamar -tidak demikian halnya yang terjadi. Mereka bahkan tidak menyediakan obat nyamuk seperti resort/hotel lainnya di pulau itu. Ada obat nyamuk elektrik yang tidak pernah diisi lagi, jadi saya harus pergi ke supermarket Bintang untuk membeli isi ulang dan semprotan serangga.\n\nSarapan paginya rata-rata, teh dingin dan kopi tanpa susu, roti paling murah dan jus dan pilihan yang sangat terbatas kecuali Anda siap untuk membayar ekstra. Staff di depan tidak terlatih dengan baik dalam hal pelayanan dan kemampuan mereka berbahasa Inggris tidak cukup baik bagi mereka untuk bekerja sebagai resepsionis hotel dan menangani permintaan-permintaan yang kadang-kadang cukup kompleks. Beberapa waktu ada 5-10 pemuda Indonesia bercengkerama di luar resort- tidak satupun dari mereka mengenakan seragam jadi mereka bukanlah staff. Saya merasa hal ini sangat mengganggu karena mereka selalu mengawasi setiap kali saya tiba atau meninggalkan kompleks sendirian.\n\nKemudian, tidak adanya petugas keamanan dan juga pintu samping yang melalui meja resepsionis selalu terbuka menandakan siapapun dapat keluar masuk tanpa diketahui. Kami diantar oleh staff hotel ke Seminyak 2 kali. Pada kali pertama kami dikenakan tarif 50.000 yang harus kami bayarkan secara tunai kepada supir (staff resepsionis), bayaran ini tidak dapat dimasukkan ke tagiham. Pada kali kedua supir kami memberi tahu kami bahwa layanan ini sebenarnya gratis! Pada hari terakhir kami, saya bertanya apakah kami boleh check out sedikit terlambat karena bayi kami masih tidur dan kami akan naik penerbangan malam pulang ke rumah. Saya diberi tahu bahwa hal ini tidak memungkinkan karena sudah ada keluarga lainnya yang akan check in pada pukul 2 siang dan mereka perlu membereskan villa.\n\nSaya juga bertanya apakah mereka dapat mengantar kami ke kota setelah kami check out tapi mereka mengatakan bahwa tidak ada mobil tersedia. Saya segera membangunkan bayi kami dan pergi, sangat kecewa dengan seluruh pengalaman kami di sana. Mereka bahkan tidak menawarkan untuk membawakan tas-tas kami dari villa dan hanya menyaksikan kami bersusah payah mengangkut semuanya (dan bayi kami) sebelum akhirnya tiba 5 menit terlambat untuk bertanya apakah kami butuh bantuan. Pada saat itu saya dan suami saya memperhatikan bahwa ada sebuah mobil Jineng tidak terpakai, bertolak belakang dengan apa yang telah mereka beritahukan pada kami! Saya sangat senang meninggalkan tempat itu!\n\nBeberapa jam kemudian kami tersadar kami telah meninggalkan selimut bayi kamar di lemari di kamar di lantau bawah. Jadi kami singgah di tengah jalan menuju bandara, dan terkejut mendapati bahwa bukan saja villa kami kosong melompong tapi para staffnya sedang menonton TV di kamar lantau bawah dan selimutnya sudah menghilang!!! Ini, untuk saya, membuat pengalaman kami menjadi benar-benar buruk! Satu-satunya hal yang bagus dari tempat ini adalah seorang gadis muda yang kadang-kadang bekerja di meja resepsionis saat para laki-laki itu tidak berada di sana, dia benar-benar udara segar. Seluruh suasana di tempat itu berubah selama ia ada di sana. Untuk siapa saja yang sedang membaca ulasan ini, saya akan benar-benar berpikir serius dua kali sebelum memutuskan untuk menginap di sini.\n\nAnda akan mendapatkan villa lain dengan perlengkapan, lokasi, dan staff yang lebih baik dengan harga yang sama atau bahkan kurang. Orang-orang ini tidak dapat dipercaya!!! Sungguh menyakitkan untuk saya harus menuliskan ulasan yang sangat menusuk ini, tapi untuk hal ini ada banyak sekali hal-hal yang perlu dipaparkan kepada para pembaca tripadvisor.",

They patiently waited to pick us up which ended up around 1am given the plane was delayed and the hour it took to get through immigration! \nThe villa itself was just lovely and the girls loved the breakfast choices and had the High Tea everyday. Jineng is well located and just 400 metres off the busy shopping area. It is also just a 20 minute walk to Double Six beach where we ran several mornings.  It also has a Circle K shop just across the road for snacks and the fun Orchard Bar just 100 metres down the road. \nThis is my second time to Jineng and I would recommend it",

I'm very particular about cleanliness, so I did notice areas where attention to details could be improved e.g finding hair in the dressing table chair, breakfast dishes not collected from villa to noon.\n\n The Villas are in a quiet street approximately 7 minute drive to the high street. If going to the high street, the staff will call a taxi for you (paid for by Jineng Villa) or they'll drop you off. \nA driver can take you on personalised tours of Bali, for a reasonable price.\n",

The staff are very helpful. They have a daily high tea which I enjoyed every single day I was there. Another great thing is they have shuttle into most arears of Seminyak, it's really helpful.

              "text": "Resident in Canberra Australia, over the years we have travelled fairly extensively.\nDuring recent times North America, UK/Europe and SE Asia have been the main focus.\nDue to their proximity to Australia, Thailand, Bali and Vietnam have become more regular destinations, each offering holidays more interesting and economical than staying within Australia.\n\nFor us 2019 is a busy year with three trips planned and this is the first.\nBali has been a fairly regular haunt (Trans Resort) but this time we went for a smaller private villa in the heart of Seminyak and stayed in January rather than later in the year. \n\nFlights were with QANTAS each way from Canberra via Sydney. One blackmark to QANTAS - I asked if we could leave Canberra on an earlier flight to make the stopover in Sydney more relaxing - 4 hours rather than less than 2.  The response was an additional charge of approx. $1000 would be applied!  No further conversation was had and instead we arrived early for our flight out of Canberra and we were offered the earlier flight with no discussions and no charges.  Being Platinum FF we had hoped for better recognition of loyalty and status than that initially proffered.  \n\nAnyway it all turned out well and a fantastic long lunch in the First Class lounge followed....it is truly a first class facility and an experience for those that can indulge.\n\nAt Bali, our bags were amongst the first off the carousel so immigration was a breeze and soon we were in the hands of a cheery and efficient driver from the Jineng Villas.\n\nTwo things were notable on the short  drive to the Villa - how much cleaner the sidewalks and roads sides were (very little rubbish and many strategically located and well-used refuse bins in evidence) .and also how much quieter the roads and sidewalks were at this time of year = a great start.\n\nAll Jineng Staff were all helpful, organised and prepared for our evening arrival.\n\nMinimal administration at check-in and we were quickly shown to our villa via a quite delightful enclosed walkway - enclosed with a bamboo archway.\n\nFirst (and lasting) impressions were all positive - the cleanliness, plumbing, electrics and wi-fi all performed to expectation.  The rooms had been sprayed for mossies and we quickly settled in.\n\nFor two of us it is a great set up; a separate dining area with lounge and dining table facilities, with TV, refrigerator, sink and (should it be needed) a food preparation area.  Cold drinks were already provided free of charge in the refrigerator along with welcome drinks and cold towels.  The bottled water is replaced daily -   6 bottles.\n\nAdjacent to this room is another large room which provides a huge bed with crisp linen, TV, cupboard, desk and usual amenities, plus wardrobe and a large bathroom with spa bath, sink, mirrors shower and toilet.  \n\nSeparating the two large rooms is an outside enclosed toilet and shower which are really useful when swimming in the pool.\n\nNow to the pool.  For us it was a great facility - clean, lovely temperature and long enough to do some useful swimming laps.  The depth is even throughout at about 1.6m however there are no steps or ladder provided for more elegant entry and exit!\nIf there is a criticism this is it - it is potentially dangerous for the less able to manage pool entry and exit and great care (and a little strength) may be required.\n\nOtherwise we found everything to be beyond reasonable criticism.\n\nFunctionally everything was provided and everything worked as desired.\nAll the paintwork and building structure had been refreshed and there was a nice feeling of someone caring and attending to the detail too often missing in such arrangements.\n\nThe breakfasts (and lunches and dinners) were served in the rooms from a quite comprehensive menu and all were enjoyed.\n\nThe transport arrangements were fantastic - anywhere in the Seminyak area free transport was provided - either the Villa private minibus or a cab was called and paid for by reception.\n\nAnd so we rate this small complex very highly and would certainly be most happy to return.  \n\nThe original bookings were made via Luxury Escapes and judged to be excellent value for money and were exactly as advertised.  Well done and thank you Jineng.",

We were blessed by the company of birds daily. \nThe villas do need some maintenance though. They are way overdue for a freshen up with some paint and plaster for the cracks. While we were there our air con, toilet and towel rack all failed. A night without air con in Bali is not something I recommend.They provided an air cooler but it wasn't strong enough. The staff were straight onto the issues when we told them. \nThe food was generally nice but we got sick from one of the prawn meals. We shared some dishes and those who ate a little got a little sick, I had the majority of the dish and was down with Bali belly for 24 hours - very sick. We chose to eat nearly all our meals elsewhere after that even though meals were part of our deal. The Karma Cafe is across the road and The Orchard Bar and Restaurant is a few doors down.\nThere are so many villas in Seminyak if that's the way you want to go, Jineng is nice but there are probably better",

It was close enough to all the shops n food but far enough away that it was nice and quiet. The villa itself was clean n inviting. Open and light but full blackout curtains if u need. The pool was absolutely gorgeous. Couple of sun loungers, dont really get much sun but u can on the side of the pool. The service was always friendly and on time. Cant thank the staff enough for going above and beyond to make us have the best time. It was our first trip to bali and staying here has made us want to come back. Really soon actually! Room service menu good, breakfast in villa good. Shuttle service good. In villa bbq amazing. Best time ever. Thanks guys ",

But you needn't walk as they will gladly drop you off ... you just stroll back when you feel like it.\n\nThe villas are nestled in a small lane, away from the busy streets with each villa having a feel of seclusion and quietness.  Yet cafes and restaurants are in easy reach.\n\nThe only negative was the bed ... a little too firm for our liking.\n\nOtherwise it is well located, friendly, and very relaxing.",

We travelled with a 19month old so enjoyed having a full fridge for milk and cartons of Bintang for husband n friend . Very quiet villas ! Big sized bedrooms !

              "text": "Stayed September 2017 in Villa E. This is the 4th villa we have stayed at in Bali.\n\nPros: Great room, large lounge/kitchenette, large fridge.A/C works well. Large bathroom and bedroom. 2nd bathroom consists of a toilet/shower/basin beside the pool.Great size pool. Staff very friendly, smiling, keen to help and assist. Villa has drivers able to take you to the Seminyak area. Villa was of a professional clean standard, and was debugged each evening, and mosquito coils left burning. Very few mosquitoes/bugs spotted in Sept.\n\nCons: Very little direct sunlight in September. Can lie in the sun in one area beside the pool for about 90-120 minutes in the morning. For the rest of the day, there is no sunlight for sunbathing, except in the pool.\nOutdoor chairs do not lie flat, so if there was sun, unable to lie on stomach or side to tan. Would have much preferred a normal sun lounger.\nVilla is a 10-12 minute walk from any real shopping, 20 minute walk to beach.\nVilla is somewhat clinical, enclosed. Whilst it is well decorated with Balinese pieces, it lacks a Bali 'feel'.\nFloors are VERY slippery when wet.",

              "text": "The place has a very relaxing ambience. The villa is spacious. The bed is so cozy. The breakfast is really good and plenty. They could setup a  birthday or anniversary surprise for free when you request one (inclusive of a rose, scattered petals and cake) There are some parts of the villa that are stained or looks weary. \nThe pool is big enough for two, it is a bit cold and a little deep. They don't have stairs so you have to pull yourself up on the edge. The staff are very welcoming, kind and humble. This villa is cheaper and bigger than other villas in Bali. The location is a bit far from the main road, which I think makes it more serene. They offer free airport transfers. In our case, we came from another hotel, so instead of airport pick up, they changed it to hotel pick up which is still for free. They have free drop off to town like Seminyak. If their shuttle is not available, they will book you a cab and pay for it. \n\nOverall, our trip to Bali was wonderful and The Jineng Villas made it more enjoyable and relaxing at the same time. This place is recommended! ",

We booked a 10 night stay from a Scoopon deal which included airport transfer as well as free breakfast every day, and a choice of free lunch or dinner every day. \n\nWe stayed in villa J - the villa was excellent - very clean and tidy, spacious and was comfortable. Bathrooms and he pool was clean and well maintained. The food provided wasn't breathtaking, but was delightful and delicious enough for us to use every day. Each room was air conditioned and the bedroom was comfortable.\n\nIt is located in Seminyak and is close to marts for quick shopping when required. \nOur villa had a common room which was spacious and great for guests, and included a full size kitchen. The only downside is there is very little cooking utensils so we weren't able to cook our own meals if we wanted to.\n\nThe level of service provided by all staff was outstanding - all friendly and welcoming, and handled all of our needs (there weren't many!).

Clean and tidy. The private pool is an added luxury. Ultimately we really enjoyed our stay here, it was tranquil and relaxing! ",

The air-conditioning was great. we had so much food included in the package which was handy, the juices were lovely. and the shuttle that took us around town whenever we needed was perfect and when they were busy they would order and fund a taxi. they would also log all taxi numbers incase you left something with them they could follow up. could fault the service. would use again.",

All villas have their own private pool.\nWe found the staff to be very professional and friendly. Special mentions go to Afry in Reception and Pande in housekeeping who consistently went out of their way to help. Housekeeping do a very thorough job.\nThe Manager, Lina, has done a great job of training the staff.\nThe villas themselves are very good and are quiet. You certainly have your privacy.\nThe pool was really good although they aren't the easiest to get into or out of.\nIt is only a 10 minute drive to the main restaurant and shopping areas of Seminyak and the villas will either drive you there at any time or pay for a taxi fare there.\nIt is a 5 minute walk to Bintang Supermarket or to Grain restaurant.\nJineng Villas is conveniently located.\nWe had a Scoopon and found it to be great value. The massages were great and the food was really good, especially the pasta dishes. \nWe loved our time at Jineng Villas.",

Extremely spacious, spotlessly clean, huge bathrooms, with separate living area, kitchen, pool and 3 TV areas  Everything is thought about right down to slippers, robes, nightly mosquito spray and even mosquito repellent plug-in device. We had breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner served in our villa each day. Food was always excellent. Staff are extremely happy and helpful.  In room massage experience varied, we had 2 good and 2 average massages.  Only downside was their wi-fi as it dropped in and out frequently and we had a couple of nights with very noisy neighbours (very loud music and shouting etc until after midnight) but other than that we would highly recommend. We stayed 5 nights.",

Location was great as well about 10 minutes walk from beach and drop off service is available. It is perfect place if you want to get away from hussle and bussle of bali and enjoy quite luxury time with your loved ones. As we are vegetarian only negative I think of is limited options for vegetarian food in manu. And there are quite few mosquitos around but staff does great job spraying repellent. Overall I would recommend jineng villa to everyone.",

The Staff are wonderful, well-trained and have service mind. The villa is very spacious with bedroom, bathroom , living room, pool, shower Room and restroom outside where you can shower after swimming. The pool is bigger than others comparing to a pool in villa which you can really swim. Location is not so far from business district of Seminyak, still walking distance. The villas also provides free transfer service to Seminyak area which very nice as walking out there is very hot , also it's high chance to be ripped off by taxi there..... even Blue Bird Taxi which they have meter ( we had really bad experience about this as taxi driver refused to use the meter and tried to charge us 350,000 for a short distance) \ud83d\ude21 They served us breakfast in villa everyday and i would say it's quite variety choices for you to chose. Besides from the bad experiences in Bali from local vendors, taxi and some people there, our decision to stay at The Jineng villas is the best one for this trip.",

The staff are so happy and accommodating nothing is ever a problem. Their English is great and conversational. I'm writing this while listening to them sweeping the front path quietly singing local tunes. The food at Jineng is beautiful. Between us have tried most selections on their lunch menu and they are great. The steak is possibly the best we have had in Asia ! We travel once a month throughout Asia for work so I think we have good grounds for comparison ! The pool is cleaned daily and at night they provide a turn down service and spray for mosquitoes which is optional however as we are out this is ok for us. There are local warungs nearby plus spas. The complimentary shuttle car is available to Seminyak and if it is in use they simply organize a taxi and pay the fare for you. Something which we don't expect. The beds are very comfortable and linen is so crisp and air conditioning in both areas is fantastic. I would definitely stay again. This place is great value for money. Fantastic accommodation - we are in Villa J ! ",

              "text": "We were really looking forward to staying at Jineng Villa's by Karaniya having just previously stayed at Seminyak Icon which is another Karaniya experience hotel a couple of weeks before. However, the difference between the two couldn't have been starker! Our one bedroom pool villa was nowhere near the standards of the equivalent one at Seminyak Icon and it cost us more for the same duration. We were naturally quite shocked by this as the vast majority of reviews for this place are pretty decent, but our stay was disappointing to say the least...maybe we got the short room straw as other guests have mentioned!\n\nOur private pool had leaves and plants floating around in it on arrival and never looked inviting during our stay. The breakfast was poor, so much so that we left most it and never ordered another. There were no mosquito coils and the whole villa just looked tired! \n\nBut the worst part was the constant flies, they were all over the shower/toilet area and made us feel dirty, like nothing was ever clean. Consequently we spent most of our time out of the villa apart from sleeping, as I was killing around 15 large flies on the tile walls every time I went in the bathroom area! As a result we cut our stay down from three days to two as we couldn't be out of there fast enough.\n\nPersonally, for us this place is overvalued and overrated in comparison to other villa's in Seminyak/Bali!

              "text": "My husband and I stayed here using a Scoopon voucher and enjoyed it a lot. Rooms were as they look in the pictures, pool was great and well maintained, as were the gardens, and service was impeccable. \n\nWe had a fair few meals included in our voucher so took advantage of them, but while the food wasn't bad, it certainly wasn't great either, and we tried most of the menu to be sure.\n\nRooms were cleaned daily, with towels changed daily too, and the turn down service at night also included spraying for mozzies and lighting mozzie coils. Great if we were out at the time, not so great if we weren't because of all the chemicals we then inhaled. At least the staff are conscious of the mozzies though.\n\nThe staff were also most accommodating when our flights got changed and instead of the original plan of checking out on time for an afternoon flight, they were able to extend our checkout time by 2 hours then let us come back for a shower at 10pm before taking us to the airport for a 1am flight. I've never known a hotel to do this before and we were ever so grateful.\n\nOne major downside which is why I couldn't give it 5 stars: the bed. We stayed in villa K and the bed was hard as rock, as well as wonky with a big dip in the middle. Pillows seemed old and flat too and I just feel when you pay for accommodation, you're mostly paying to sleep somewhere so hopefully staff take note and put some new beds in because I don't think I'm the first one to make this comment. I can also usually sleep anywhere so it's a big deal for me to say this!\n\nOther than that, a lovely stay! Very homely, welcoming vibe and we enjoyed our stay very much.",

Some minor improvements to make the villas better, they need some maintenance such as some tiles and patches of paint. The mattresses need to be changed a bit uncomfortable. The pool is nice and big but getting in and out of the pool is a bit tricky. The final thing is the staff is polite and responsive but everyday they get the breakfast order wrong and we had to send it back. \n\nOverall its a great stay but needs some minor improvements ",

Our room cleaned daily and all towels were replaced daily also.\n\nThe staff are honestly amazing. They can't do enough for you. They are polite and friendly and helpful. We booked our trip to gili Islands through them and they did everything for us. Nothing was too much trouble.\n\nThe free car trip to anywhere within Seminyak is so ideal and saved us worrying about taxi's etc. If we wanted to venture outside Seminyak the staff organized a taxi for us. \n\nWe had meals included in our deal and the food was average - that is honestly the only negative point and it wasn't even bad just not amazing.\n\nWould 100% stay at this villa again and loved our time there.

Both were very spacious and well set out and the pool was in between both. It was lovely sitting by the pool with everything at your fingertips. There was even an outside shower/toilet so you didn't have to go inside all wet.\nAll meals were provided and delivered/served in our dining room - they would let you know when it was ready - it was great being spoilt.\nThe staff greeted you by name every time - it really made it feel like we were part of a large family. \nThe butler service was great - they take you to anywhere in Seminyak and the taxi drive home was always really cheap (only a couple of dollars).\nThey have security staff out the front of reception 24 hours a day. They always greeted us and checked our car to make sure we got all our belongings. They even helped us with a dodgy taxi driver who was trying to rip us off - we cannot praise these guys enough!!\nReception is also open 24 hours - this was very handy so you could leave your keys there, you don't have to worry about losing them.\nThis place is amazing, I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to stay in Seminyak close to most things but not on your doorstep.\nWe could not hear the neighbours or any of the nightlife, it was lovely and peaceful.\nPerfect!!!",

The attention to detail and desire to ensure that our stay was as comfortable as possible was excellent. The villa was clean and well appointed and suited our needs very well. We travelled with a 5 yr old and near 2 year old, so the second bedroom was a godsend.\nThe staff were friendly and went out of their way to help - the daily high teas were fantastic, the daily fresh clean towels, drop offs in Seminyak and spraying of rooms with repellent before bed were all much appreciated. The breakfasts were great!\nThe only downside for me was that I couldn't watch the AFL (I know, but I am a tragic!) as the reception on the satellite TV was not that great - a short 10 minute walk to a local venue sorted that out.\nI would highly recommend Jineng Villas and would definitely stay there again.",

Also have a spa bath which had water in it when we arrived and air conditioner in the rooms when we arrived. But with using the pool we didn't get around to using the spa.  We had a special which included  breakfast, dinners and high tea which was all lovely and all bought to the villa. Massage girls where good but don't talk much English, we put a order in one day and they bought the massage tables earlier on and they didn't arrive then when we rang to ask they had to change the time as they weren't available then the boys took the massage table away and when they finally came they massaged us both on the bed, The next time was different girls and they had the table and where much better than the first two. \nThe only thing wrong which will stop us going back there is the pool is hard to get into for the elderly.  The first step is very low down and then you have to fall the rest of the way into the pool.  I'm, 5ft 8 and I had to get on my hands and knees to enter the pool and had to push up on the ledge and rolled on the ground to get out.  We asked  2 different people for a ladder or something but they either didn't understand and said no.  The pool is lovely when you get in and good depth.  Great private and quite place to stay,  you only go down a alley way to get to the  bigger grocery shop, or other restaurant's and they have a little deli opposite for a few items.  Restaurant next door wasn't very good as the people don't talk English, hard to get items and when we asked for a cool drink either coke or maxi  they said they didn't have it then we saw someone else get it. after us so hubby wouldn't go back there again. Over all its lovely place if you are nimble enough to get in and out of the pool.",

This was a scoopon deal and we were given breakfast plus lunch or dinner for the 7 nights as well as an afternoon tea. We only had one dinner but the breakfasts were terrific with fresh juices and eggs and muesli really heaps of stuff to choose from!... Pick up and drop off at the airport was also included as was a coutesy bus to seminyak when we wanted it!! \nThe villa itself was huge with a massive bed and great bathroom and a separate lounge with TV where we could all eat compfortably. The pool was magic ! I would recommend the Jineng Villas to anyone and although the room/pool itself was sensational it was the friendliness of all the staff that was the real highlight. They just could not do enough for us. Keep up the good work !",

The villa itself was stunning, modern, and even bigger than it looks in the pictures. The pool was amazing, big and so great to have a private pool, it was very clean too. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and were always available to help you out. The free shuttle offered was great for being taken anywhere in Seminyak so we didn't have to worry about taxis. The villa is located on a quiet street so it isn't noisy at all when you are in your villa and the big supermarket is only about an 8 minute walk away. The aircon was great in the bedroom and the living area. A delicious breakfast was included every day and you can pick from a large list of choices the day before. We also ordered cocktails and some small plates of food throughout the day on the room service and it was all very reasonably priced and was delivered quickly. Free wifi was great too! I couldn't recommend Jineng Villas more if you are staying in Seminyak! We actually spent 2 full days just chilling in the villa at our pool we enjoyed it that much. We will be back!",

The quality was great.\n\nThe villa is located in a quiet street so the villa is nice and peaceful, however it is only a 6 minute walk to Bintang supermarket and all of the shops and restaurants on Jalan Legian.\n\nIt was our wedding anniversary and the villa brought us a delicious cake and decorated the room with beautiful flowers and roses. This was a lovely touch.\n\nWe would 100% recommend others to stay here, we will definitely return.\n\nThank you for a lovely stay :)",

We had cockroaches in the pool, dirty towels in the bathroom and amazingly slow internet connection. On top of that, they couldn't provide us a proper guide to take us around and charged 600K IDR for a 6h trip, with the driver asking US where to go and doing his best not to show us too much, making sure we had to book also the day after. When we complained about the 400K IDR (the cost of a half day tour) for a round trip to Uluwuatu (50' to go, 50' to come back) they rudely suggested us to get a cab. Definitely not recommended.",

However, the experience was just disappointing. While the pool was amazing, really clean, other parts of the villa like the bathrooms, and living area are in serious need of an upgrade. The tiles in the bathrooms were mouldy, there was a bad sewage smell that came through whenever we took a shower or turned on the tap, the towels looked really old and used, and part of the ceiling in the living room actually came down while we were sitting on the sofa. Although the staff at the villa were very friendly, and location of the villa is great, I wouldn't go back again. ",

The pool is way bigger than the regular plunge pools that a lot of private villas have, you can actually swim here.\n\nRooms were clean and well stocked, including mosquito repellent and travel adapters. You can rent DVDs if you like to either watch in bed or the living room ( we dind't get time for this). Breakfast has to be picked a day earlier and is then brought to your room at a time of your choice which is very convenient. Excellent breakfast too.\n\nThe staff here don't seem to know how to say no. Nothing we asked them was too much. They offer complimentary drop offs anywhere in Seminyak by friendly drivers 24 hours a day. They've even got a separate menu for after hours room service that includes food from neighbouring restaurants since their kitchens close by 22:00.\n\nWe had to be at the airport by 6am on our final day, and since we didn't have time for breakfast, they packed us a little snack box each with sandwiches and fruits which was very nice.\n\nAll in all we loved the villa and would recommend it to anyone. Thank you Teja and all the other staff (can't remember the names sorry!). You guys were awesome.",

We were greeted and offered refreshing welcome drinks before being shown to our Villa. The 2 rooms were spacious with king size beds and the on suite had already had a bath prepared to refresh after our flight. Our daily breakfast of choice was served in our kitchen / lounge room. The privacy and serenity offered in the villa made it seem as if we were the only ones there. They offer a shuttle service from the Hotel to any where in Seminyak for free at any time and all we did was arrange a taxi to return. When the taxi arrived the security staff checked it to make sure nothing had been left behind and recorded the taxi details just in case it would be required later. All of our requests to staff were handled with efficiency and friendly smiles and nothing was too much trouble. Enough bottled water was always on hand to satisfy our needs. They also arranged a dinner booking for us at a restaurant at short notice which is usually hard to get into. The rooms were always prepared perfectly. The location means that you are away from the busy area of Kuta but only a $5 aus taxi fare to get back. There is a nice Pub and shops within walking distance.",

Check in was super easy and quick. They had also emailed me a few days before to confirm I was coming. They had written out and explained all the benefits that we received. \nThe villa was amazing, huge king bed, separate lounge room, big private pool and full kitchen. Perfect place to stay if you want your own space. \nWe received two massages and we booked these with reception. The ladies arrived to our villa with the equipment and we had an hour massage in the comfort of our own room. What more can you ask for?\nBreakfast was brought to us every morning and we could choose what we wanted and what time it should arrive. Always hot and fresh.\nWe also received a daily meal that we could choose - available between 10am-10pm. Great food and always hot when it arrived. Hi tea was also offered every afternoon from 2-5pm and they brought that to your room. Always setting it up on the dining table and laying out cutlery etc.\nRooms were very clean and comfortable. The staff also provided a free shuttle to basically anywhere in the Seminyak area, which was great. \nGreat little spa place right next door that you can have some massages, good prices too. The orchard is a restaurant/pub that is very close by. Does happy hour mango daiquiris :) yes!\nAbout a 10-15 minute walk to the beach which was fine. Beaches were pretty dirty due to the weather and rubbish being washed up. \nThe staff were always friendly and respectful, always calling or knocking before they entered or brought food etc.\nHad a fantastic time here and loved it. Would definitely return. Thank you!",

When we arrived they gave all 4 of us a fresh drink. They showed us to our beautiful villa and explained everything to us that was part of our Scoopon package and where to find everything. The staff where brilliant and so helpful. They serviced our room everyday  and when I mean clean they even washed the windows daily and they supplied plenty of bottled water daily. There shuttle service was flawless they took us anywhere local and if there was no one available they got us a taxi and paid for it. We had 2 kids  with us a 2 and 4 year old so I asked for a pool fence which was supplied at an extra cost but it was perfect. The staff even sent us photos before we arrived showing us of the pool fence being up. There food was great and service was flawless. The staff came in every night to spray the room and place new coils in to stop mosquitoes. The staff arrange for us to get to the zoo and confirmed all booking with us the night before as well.  When it was time to leave they let us stay past check out time in the Villa until it was time to go back to the airport. Jineng Villas is a short 5 min walk to the main Street and across the road from the villa is 24 hour mini mart. I would highly recommend Jineng Villas to anyone. ",

We arrived tired after an 8 hour delay courtesy of Jetstar and were met promptly and given water and refreshing towels immediately. On arrival we were given a glass of juice and from there on we were looked after so very well. The staff were friendly, professional and helpful at all times. The shuttle service to anywhere in Seminyak was great. The villas are lovely, clean and spacious and the standard of cleaning was excellent. I had heard that mosquitoes might be a problem but not at all - they spray the rooms and light a coil each evening and I was not bitten once! And believe me mozzies love me! \nMy daughter and I had the most wonderful relaxing holiday and will definitely return. If I can find one tiny criticism it is that our scoopon voucher said you could include lunch or dinner each day but if you wanted lunch it had to be from the dinner menu not the lunch one and we never felt like a main meal in the middle of the day. We do feel that if lunch is included it should be from the lunch menu. \nThe food though was nicely presented, delivered promptly and was always tasty. Well done Jineng Villas! ",

The Villas are in a quiet street 5 minutes or so from the shopping streets, and about 20 minutes walk from the beach. Their staff are always smiling and courteous, and always ready to help. And they are happy to drive you to the beach, or other local places in the local area. They will assist in finding places you want to go, or arranging a driver for a personal tour. We found the beautiful pool within our villa was the place we loved to be much of the time. The bedroom and living/dining room are spacious, and there are simple kitchen/cooking facilities. The grand bathroom includes a spa bath. We used a Scoopon deal which involved daily breakfast (very generous), a pleasant high tea and a main course for lunch or dinner. The food, brought to the villa, was enjoyable and nicely presented, if not Masterchef standard. We enjoyed the included massages. We recommend Jineng Villas for people who don't need to be right at the beach, and want a pleasant and refreshing place to stay in Bali.",

Free WiFi kept the kids happy. The private pool was delightful for a swim after a long day out in the warm Bali weather. Meals were a treat. Great selection for breakfast every morning & then dinner in the evening - all laid on by the wonderful staff. All we had to do was choose. To top it off we were also offered High Tea which we only managed to have a few times but that was great too. There is a 24 hour Mini Mart (Circle K) across the road for any snacks & drinks and an Irish Pub down the road called The Orchard. Daily drop-offs to Seminyak were great. Just let the staff know & they will organise it for you. In general, this was our first visit to Bali & the staff were always too happy to please. This made our stay even more enjoyable. Definitely plan to go back again & hopefully soon.",

              "text": "Stayed a few nights in a one bedroom villa. One bedroom, but it came with a large adjoining glassed-in bathroom with spa bath and shower, and a dining, kitchen and lounge room next to the private swimming pool. A second shower and toilet was located between the main rooms, accessed from the pool deck. A high wall and tall vegetation ensured privacy and quiet within.\n\nEverything was laid on - breakfast, another meal of choice per day, a daily high tea and several complimentary one hour massages - all at a time of your choice. A butler ensured every housekeeping need was met and a driver was always on hand to take you anywhere local in air-conditioned comfort, including airport transfers.\n\nThere is a free and relatively fast WiFi connection, cable TV in the lounge and bedroom and adequate kitchen facilities although there's almost no reason to use the them apart from the toaster and kettle. The refrigerator is always kept well stocked with complimentary bottled water. Both the main rooms of the villa were air-conditioned using split A/C units.\n\nWhile Jineng Villas is a bit hidden away in a narrow back street, running parallel a main Seminyak shopping street, some even narrower laneways do offer 5 minute walk shortcuts between the shops and the Villas. This means the large Bintang Supermarket is little over a 5 minute walk away. Also a very quirky Irish Pub, called The Orchard, is only 100m down the road from the Villas. It has good meals, a selection of cold drinks and cocktails and live music at least once a week. It also has a resident chicken called Orchie who wanders about clucking away to herself.\n\nEvery one of Jineng Villas' staff were very courteous and friendly - butlers, maids, drivers, porters, front desk, gardeners and cleaning staff. Nothing was too much to ask for - although finding something to ask for would be difficult unless maybe you forgot your bedroom safe password, ahem.\n\nKeeping everything clean and tidy in a tropical environment isn't easy, but bathrooms were mould-free and the pool clean. If I was forced to find a fault it'd be no handrail to hold to get into or out of the pool.\n\nWe will certainly be organising a return visit with friends since the 2 bedroom villas appear equally attractive.",

The staff there were really friendly and helpful, providing awesome service, including airport pickup/return trip and free shuttle service to Seminyak at any time. \n\nThe free daily breakfast delivered to our villa daily exceeded our expectations and we really looked forward to breakfast which we get to choose from a list of choices. The breakfast we had was good and filling. We weren't able to try their bbq as it requires 1 day booking in advance though I believe it would have been great as well.\n\nThere is a pub The Orchard less than 5min walk away offering great food and a mini mart opened 24hrs just opposite if you would like to grab some snacks. \n\n Overall a great stay exceeding expectations. Highly recommended.",

Service was faultless with staff responding speedily to our needs on a 24hr basis - nothing was too much trouble for them and everything was provided with a smile on their faces. Despite being in convenient walking distance to Seminyak Road and Double Six beach, the villa offers free transport to any destination in Seminyak. This is excellent value accommodation and the only negative thing I can think of is that the poolside loungers and seating were a little uncomfortable.",

Stayed in a 2 bedroom villa and anything we needed was a call away and no effort to get additional drinks, ice or anything else. Villas kept in perfect condition and a shuttle service to drop us anywhere in town. Order your own choice if breakfasts and juices and toasts daily delivered to your kitchen and setup for you. I cannot say enough here to compliment the team at Jineng Villas - we are definitely coming back !!!!",

The staff were all fantastic and could not do enough to make us comfortable. They serve you an amazing breakfast right to your Villa every Morning. I could get used to that! The food was great. Only a 10 minute walk to the heart of town . A good spa next door and a fun Pub called Orchard very close . We has an in Villa massage all included in the price. We were only a 5 minute drive to Double 6 Beach that is a very fun area. They would shuttle us anywhere in Seminyak for no charge. We were very happy with everything at Jineng except the lounge chair at the Villa. Not comfortable at all. Very minor in the big picture. We would go back in a heart beat. Thanks Jineng! You guys were great.",

There is a good massage place right next door. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The villas are lovely and spacious. However there is no area to sunbath as it is all under cover and the sun loungers don't lie flat. The villas are great if you are out and about a lot but not really relaxing enough with such limited sun bathing space. ",

              "text": "The Jineng Villas and the service was FANTASTIC!!!\n\nBreakfast (served in your villa) was abundant and yummy, with plenty of options. The area where the villas are locates is not too far away from Seminyak Rd, the beach and Seminyak Square but... the area around the villas is not so nice, but then again the majority of Seminyak is like this, where villa accommodation reigns supreme, with only a hand full of resort type of accommodation options available. \n\nThe villa (for 4 people) was clean, comfortable and \"modern\"  with plenty of room. The villa itself is divided into an upstairs and downstairs rooms each with en-suite. Both rooms overlook the pool area which once again is well appointed. \n\nNext to the pool area is an open plan living/dining area. Roomy and comfortable. \n\nThe staff were excellent. Extremely friendly (like most Balinese) and very accommodating. \n\nAs mentioned the area surrounding the villas is OK, with a 24hr convenience store across the road, a taxi rank within 50mins and an Pub with good food and live music a few nights a week. \n\nIf you have a young family walking into town might be a little too far but, the friendly staff will drop you off anywhere in the Seminyak area free of charge. You will have to get a taxi back. Make sure you get a taxi driver that is willing to turn on the meter otherwise, don't pay more than $20,000 (AUD $2 approx) for the ride. \n\nI'm sure you will enjoy your stay as much as we did.",

On our arrival our room was decorated with petals and towel swans as well as a full bathtub full of flowers. The villa was spacious, modern and clean and the staff were very nice and easy to communicate with in terms of questions about tours and places to go to. We didn't see many other guests so our stay felt quite intimate. There was a lot of construction in the area but the drop off service was great and it really wasn't far to get to shops and restaurants and the beach. The food and massage service were great.We would definitely come and stay here again!",

The staff are almost the best feature here - just excellent in every way, nothing was any trouble and our mornings punctuated by \"Buggy!\" and big smiles was a wonderful way to start the day. \n\nThe bamboo canopied walkway is so pretty and makes the place feel extra special.  Rooms are spacious and well set up and we loved the separate spaces and so much living area.  Only downsides: bed a bit too firm and they need adjustable sunbeds with cushioning, the wicker is hard and the angle is a bit much for neck comfort.\n\nWill definitely be back.",

Fragrant rose-petals and frangipani flowers, together with a special heart shaped cake, made us feel very welcome. The reception staff were most helpful with accurate directions, distances and approximate expenditures. All staff spoke very good English and were friendly, and happy. Although the villas are not new they are very well maintained. The meals were plentiful and delicious delivered to your villa, if you did want to venture out there are several places in close proximity that served cold drinks and good food. The Italian corner and the Orchard hotel both Good! The road in front of the premises is under construction however there was no construction noises that disturbed us. Very private and peaceful !

It was a joy to come home to their smiling faces after a day out.\nThe free shuttle bus to the centre of Seminyak was extremely convenient. \n\nThe villa itself was clean and comfortable. The breakfast and room service was also to a high quality. \n\nDaniel and I greatly appreciated in particular the help we got from the staff when we lost our passports in another part of Bali. The team truly went above and beyond for us and we could not thank them more.",

I read the reviews for this villa and decided to purchase a scoopon voucher,  I was a little nervous but the photos and other reviews are all 100% accurate.  The villa is beautiful and the private pool and separate lounge are perfect for those wanting to relax and indulge in quality 'me' time.  The staff are all very helpful and speak good english.  One morning we were going to go on an all day tour and were unable to have our included breakfast but they offered to pack us a breakfast sandwich to take with us!! The in-room massage were amazing and it was perfect being able to indulge in the relaxing massage while our daughter slept in the room next door without needing to worry about her. Each day the staff deliver your food to your room and they also spray for mosquitoes to ensure a pleasant stay.  We had very little annoyance from the mosquitoes.\n\nThe food provided by the hotel was exceptional! It was all high quality, presented nicely and we didn't get sick at all. No Bali Belly for us :) \n\nI can't recommend this place any higher - it was a perfect get away for us",

After saw the reviews of several villas we finally decided to stay at The Jineng since it seem worth the price with free BBQ or Massage and we saw many good comments about it.\nAnd it was like what we expect. The place are so clean, swimming pool is big enough for 2, living room and kitchen with Air cond, and staff also friendly. I like the atmosphere.\nWhen I get my free BBQ there was a plenty of food that we can't finish it. super worth it.\n\nBut why I didn't put 5 star for the review? \nThey did not serve welcome drink upon check in as they mention on my booking that we will get welcome drink.\nUnfortunately in my Villa where I stay, the bed was too old. I can't sleep well. Very lack quality of sleep. Woke up in the morning with my back ache.\nThe breakfast quite good even its boring for 4nights. The only bad thing about the breakfast was only nasi goreng. Taste was awful. Mie goreng was much much better.\n\nBut it was a nice stay overall.",

I would happily return here in the future and highly recommend it for the price and packages..\nThanks again..\n\n",

The villas are very private and quiet, about a 40-50K taxi ride from the central seminyak area with the popular restaurants etc. The free car from the villas to any location within the local area was very handy. Food was great and there was also a Circle K across the road where you could get more snacks and drinks if needed - very handy. However, despite being well cleaned daily, the villas could do with a renovation to shine them up a bit. A few of the fixtures and drapery need replacing as they are stained. ",

Overall our stay was lovely and the staff are so friendly and helpful!\n\nPros:\nThe staff - they are all brilliant!\nThe villa - lots of space, excellent air con, 2 toilets and 2 showers. \nThe free shuttle into Seminyak wherever you want\nClose to Bintang Supermarket\nThe pool (in the sun from 10.30-2 each day)\n\nCons:\nBreakfast- was always lukewarm on arrival. The menu looks good but unfortunately the food and drink was average. The juices were thick and flavourless. The best options were the banana pancakes and nasi goreng (although it was lukewarm and the satays cold)\nThe location - need to get shuttle/taxi to all the main restaurants and shops. Walking takes about 45 mins to Seminyak square but because of the heat it's hard to do.\nMosquitos in the villa. They spray the villa every night but unfortunately there were still mosquitos\nThe massages - very average however I think we didn't have their usual stuff\n\n",

Got to our villa which was close to the end, quite tranquil to walk down the beautiful arches of trees. Villa was nice, mostly clean. Out bath tap was leaking (however not a big issue) and the room was serviced daily. Very quiet, however think I would prefer to be closer to the shops/restaurants as walking was a bit far, especially at night. In saying that, the shuttle was freely available, and a taxi supplied if the shuttle was busy. Not sure if security was 24/7 as often it seemed no one was out the front. Staff were lovely and accommodating to all requests. Pool was lovely and air con worked very well. Thanks for the stay!",

The fruit juices were a little strange. We were also offered free soft drinks and water in the fridge and these were replenished daily.\nThe villa itself was quite large with a nice sized pool. However as mentioned in some of the earlier posts by others, the housekeeping could be better. The villas could also be better maintained. My bathroom had some foul smell arising from the sink. There are also a fair amount of mozzies so repellent is necessary.\nHowever based on the price we paid, I feel that it was good value for the 2 rooms.",

I have mixed reviews about the hotel to be honest. \n\nOn the outside, the hotel is beautiful, the path to the villas are really amazing as well.  However, the welcome was not the best and a few other things that I will describe below\n\n-\tHotel is located in the smaller streets along sunset road, about 10-15 minutes from Seminyak by car. \n-\tThe welcome from the porter was not very nice. He just looks angry and disgruntled to receive guests. \n-\tThe welcome drink was generous and refreshing. Check in area is pretty small. It can only host a couple at one time comfortably. \n-\tThere was also a buggy ride after we checked in to our suites. We initially thought it will take a while to reach our suites, but it was just a 10 second drive, which surprised us. haha..\n-\tUpon entering the villa, we took off our slippers and entered the area just outside the room, where the tanning beds were. The floor was oily to my dismay. \n-\tWhen we entered the bedroom area, the floor was also oily, and yes, this was the same for the bathing area. \n-\tThere was a nicely stocked minibar with soft drinks, and drinking water. Soft drinks only complimentary for the first round while bottled mineral water is replenished daily. \n-\tThe curtains were slightly dirty, especially at the end, where it was touching the floor. \n-\tThere was also a musky smell in the wardrobe. There was a weird taste in the bathing water, which we did not experience when we were in another resort in Ubud. \n-\tThe kettle in the room was also dirty. The new kettle we requested was also dirty. \n-\tThere was oil smell (left from massages) on the bedsheets. \nCLEANLINESS IS NOT THEIR FORTE in my opinion and their housekeeping needs to buck up. \n\nPROS\n-\tThey provide complimentary 2 way transfers to and from the airport\n-\tThey provide one way transfer to any destination within kuta, seminyak and legian if I am not wrong of your choice. That really helped us in saving money on travel. \n-\tThe pool in the villa is clean \n-\tThe bathtub has Jacuzzi facilities\n-\tThe villas are private and it\u2019s like your home away from home\n-\tThe breakfast is selected the day before and sent to your room. The spread is decent. \n-\tThere is a convenient shop just across the road that you can buy snacks from. \n-\tThe room was available before our check in time",

They allowed us an early check-in which was very convenient for us. Their room service was excellent, which we never noticed but felt, as every time we came back all the towels were changed and everthing in tip-top shape. They provided us shuttle to places we wanted to visit. All in all, simply super!!  If opportunity knocks again we will definitely revisit the villa.",

We chose the BBQ dinner, they really put an extra effort despite the odd timing since we finished with our daytour a little bit late. And the setting was quite romantic too, we loved it to the max!\n\n",

But not too far as you can make use of the shuttle service to be dropped off to anywhere in Seminyak and just take a cab back to the villa. The private pool is just awesome. \n\nComplementaries:\nWe had a complimentary Balinese massage which was incredible. Our little girl celebrated her first birthday while we were there and the staff made it so memorable with amazing poolside decorations and a lil cake for the lil bub.\nFood:\nWe ordered breakfast previous night and it was ready the time we asked for next morning. As we were vegetarians, our request was accommodated when we asked something off the menu. \n\nMedical.\nOur baby had a high temperature the first night we arrived but we were provided immediate medical attention the moment we asked. A doctor and a nurse came by for a consultation and prescribed antibiotics. We were asked to do a dengue test but refused as she soon got better. \n\nStaff:\n\nThe staff are awesome, we even made some friends along the way. Each one of them is very helpful and cheerful. We have made some great memories with all of you.\n\nAdvice to management:\nYour staff are awesome, please retain them. :)\nSometimes the wifi was slow but I guess that needs to be looked at by management.\n\nWe will definitely come back if we visit Bali again. :)",

The villa was very clean with a great layout. Facilities were well maintained and the pool was a great size. The staff are really great;they make you feel very well taken care of and our needs were very well met. Their shuttle service also made it very easy to go anywhere that is further away from the villa but it's location also made it easy to walk to nearby main streets. We highly recommend anyone to stay at the Jineng and we hope to be back.  ",

At the onset had read some wonderful reviews abt this property which helped me make my mind to book this property. \nReached Bali and the free shuttle service was prompt and there to pick me and my 3 friends at the airport. Great start to our Holiday. Friendly driver. The staff is also very cheerful and helpful. Had booked a 2 bedroom villa with a private pool and the property is true to the pics one sees on the website. It's very neat and since it's a relatively new property or newly painted, it's very soothing to the eyes. Fairly Big sized rooms and a nice toilet bath which is kept very clean by the housekeeping staff. The pool too is nice and apt. Not to huge and not the size of a jacuzzi also. \nThe breakfast every morning needs to be selected from a choice of options and is delivered to the Villa and the service is prompt. For local transport there is a free shuttle service to nearby beach and market or one can hire a motorbike for approximately 60000 Indonesian ruppiah.\nThe beach is a 5 minute bike ride. The nearest beach is Double six beach and the Seminyak market is halfway to the beach. Even the happening Legian Street n Kuta are abt 15/20 mins away on the bike. \nAll in all the stay was very relaxed and the property is a very cosy one. Would recommend it for couples and people looking at a relaxed holiday. \nWe stayed in Villa no 2 or Villa B and since it's close to the reception and yet away it was very convenient. \nWould love to be back. Though the weather in Bali is very hot and humid and I say this even though I come from India. So pack mostly the short stuff to wear. Happy holidays :)\nCheers. Singha the local beer is yummy. Try the Lime n Raspberry flavours too. ",

That is an honest statement. The villa itself is lovely and spacious, its very CLEAN and the pool was perfect. The staff were the BEST we've had and considering our next stop was a 5 star resort Jinengs service was much Much better than the actual 5 star resort!\nTheir staff truly are the biggest asset here and nothing was ever to much trouble. They came in and set up breakfast every morning. The food was fault less even the pool side snacks delivered to us pool side were the bomb!! I honestly don't have a single bad thing to say. If you're looking at reviews to find decent accommodation look no further, book now!! we will be back :-)",

And I have to say that the choice was right as we had a great experience.\n\nAfter the initial booking, I had to postpone the travel by 2 weeks as i came down with chicken pox and the Villa was very responsive and understanding in moving my booking at no extra cost.\n\nThe villa entry itself is very welcoming abd well maintained. When we arrived, we found the Villa to be exactly as advertised. The pool was well maintained and so was the bedroom and restrooms. The service was brilliant and the Villa staff were very friendly and smiling. Breakfast was good and the portions were heavy. The Villa staff even arranged a surprise b'day cake for my wife and wished her by singing a b'day song. \n\nHardly anything to complain about, but a couple of suggestions. We found the bedroom air-conditioning to be a bit slow to our liking and maybe this could be something of a personal preference, but a faster cooling system would be great in Bali's humid conditions. Another suggestion would be to add handhelds to the jacuzzis.\n\nWould recommend Jineng to whoever looking for luxury stay at reasonable cost.\n\nRegards,\nSai Sankar and Uttara",

Even thought the location is a little further out, the free shuttle bus more than makes up for this - was always available at a moments notice. We loved how quiet it was away from the hustle and noise of the Bali streets but still close enough to all the action when you wanted it. Airport transfers were also fab.Thanks for a great stay!",

Bali was crowded due to the new year festivities as well as its peak tourism period, but the atmosphere was excellent. we reached the hotel in about 30-40 min, given the traffic outside the hotel. Hotel entrance/front might seem abit small and may raise a couple of doubts about your booking, but that's all a facade, reception is small but moving to your private villa really is something, there are numerous villas down a bamboo sort of canopy walk way leading to your villa entrance. Opening the two doors to your villa is nothing but impressive large pool, private sectioned lounge/kitchen and private section massive bedroom with dressing station, desk. Th bathroom was large, amazing tub and rain showers. Plenty complimentary cool drinks (6 Cans for our stay) as well as 6 bottles of water each day was provided. Pool also has 2 loungers and its pretty relaxing on a hot day by the pool. Breakfast is done through ordering from a menu the night before with it being served at a time chosen in your villa. reception will give you a call in the morning at the time breakfast is requested to open your villa door.for delivery. Breakfast was great. The hotel also offers complimentary shuttle to semiyak main road so you can easily get around from there. Excellent service was also received from the cleaning staff. A couple of cleaners some to tidy your villa including a pool boy, garden boy. Great service as well as provided mosquito coils. There are a lot of mosquito in Bali so if you would be wise to bring some sort of body applied mosquito repellent for use in the day or even at your villa. Your also way better of renting a scooter as the cabs are a huge rip off. Scooter/bike rental via the hotel is recommended. Given the peak seam we stayed between Dec 30th and Jan 3rd, villa prices are on the very high side.",

Spacious, comfortable and with a warm pool always crystal clear .\nThe rooms (bathroom included) were daily and carefully cleaned.\n\nThe breakfast service was punctual and good even if I'd have appreciated a more different choice (cause I dont like not at all the eggs, except in minimum dose). About the rest, tasty food....only I'd suggest to improve the juices.\n\nThe extern area was extremely relaxing between the accurate cleaning, all comforts offered by the hotel (sunbeds, extra towels for the pool, double toilet...), the joyful sounds of the birds and the pleasent smell of good fumigator against the mosquitos.\n\nStaff eccellent. All were so friendly, attentive and helpful, always ready to hear my exigences and find the best solution (all my complimets to the management). \n\nI found very celere and useful the drop-off free service-transport from the hotel to Seminyak area.\nMassage service very good.\n\nI highly recommend the Jining Villa because it's a perfect place where I'll want surely come back\n\nThe only issue was that the wifi wasn't so stable and sometimes the connection was difficult even for long time (independently by the use's reasons it's a service needed today day). \n\nI was very happy to choose The Jineng Villas for my stay in Bali where I really spent a an ecellent week.\n\nValentina - Italy & Spain",

The rooms are maintained and cleaned to a very high standard. The management are doing a good job with their training as the staff were so consistent. The breakfast every day was very good and probably the best that we have had in Bali.  Before leaving we booked for another visit in April, that is the best type of recommendation. My wife and I visit Bali from the Uk and have stayed in Seminyak approx 40 times it is important to have a very good villa so that we can be comfortable to enable us to do our business from the villa and this is perfect.  If you are travelling for business or wanting a romantic retreat the Jining villa is perfect.",

The best part is waking up every morning and jumping straight into the pool !! Yes wifi did occasionally drop in and out but that didn't bother us - you're on holidays, you shouldn't be glued to your phone ! \nBreakfast was delivered to us every morning and set up on the dining table - we were provided with more than enough food !\nOur villa also had a bath tub but we never used it as we were always in the pool.\nIf you're looking for a place to relax and getaway from the hustle and bustle, I highly recommend this place - will definitely be coming back !",

              "text": "My husband and I stayed here for a week in October. We were greeted at the airport and transported back to our villa. On check in we received a yummy welcome drink before being escorted to our villa. We stayed in villa F. The villa is awesome. Huge kingsize bed. The bathroom had a huge spa bath and the shower had a rain style shower head. It was extremely quiet which we loved. We heard no noise at all ever! It was very very clean and was cleaned daily. The breakfast was plentiful and always on time. Heaps to choose from and always hot fresh and delicious! They give you free wifi which is great but if you aren't using it it logs you out. So you have to keep logging in all the time. The location is a little out of the way. We like walking so this didn't bother us. We also hired a motorbike for the week to get around. There is a courtesy bus the resort will take you anywhere in Seminyak. We used this a couple of times at night so we could both drink! The staff are all amazing and so friendly. There is only two things I can fault. We put our dirty laundry in the basket provided but never asked for it to be cleaned by the resort. Their prices are astronomical compared to on the street! The basket was emptied twice and cleaned at a cost of over $30 AUD. As we never filled in the provided request and signed this to be done we were a little annoyed. The only other thing was when we booked we advised them we needed a very late check out as we weren't flying out until 11pm at night. Although I was told at the time of booking they may not be able to accommodate us we weren't told until the day before we were leaving that they couldn't give us a late checkout. So we had 11 hrs without a room. If they had emailed me before we were arriving I would have booked another night. They did lock our luggage up and let us use another villa to shower before we left for the airport. Besides that only have very positive things to say and we would definitely stay there again!",

A short stroll through a couple of lanes brings you out onto Seminyak road just across from the Bintang supermarket so it is well located.",

From the moment of arrival with their driver waiting at the airport to the moment we were taken back to the airport everything was fantastic. The villas are exactly as depicted in the pictures, modern, clean in perfect state of maintenance. The swimming pool is quite large , I think around 8x3m good enough for a few laps. The staff is wonderful, meeting every request when needed. There's free one way transport within the Seminyak area. Just across the villa there's a small 24h mini market with most of the small stuff, snacks and drinks you may need. Breakfast is served in the villa every morning and there's a choice of western or indonesian dishes.\nIf there's anything that could be improved it would be the number of items in the room service menu. The menu is good but not very extensive. Since the villas are so comfy and good, I just wish the menu was much more extensive so there will be no need to go out anywhere else to eat. ",

They introduced \"the living stone\" which was the only cafe opened as early as 8am. The idea was fantastic and they were flexible to allow us to check in as soon as they finish cleaning up the room. The free shuttle service was a fabulous idea as it could easily save up alot money as they drive us to the tourist attractions.\n\nThe room were comfortable, neat, clean and NO MOSQUITOES, in fact they have mosquitoes coils placed. They offered to clean up the room despite we did place a \"privacy\"tag place outside the villa doors. They punctually pushed in our breakfast every morning and the breakfast was well-cooked, served both westernized and traditional breakfast.. The swimming pool were so clean, that we swam everyday, we have nothing to fault about the rooms.\n\nThe hotel crews were friendly and is always smiley regardless which time of the day. The hotel has 2-3 mini van to shuttle their own guest, there were times they were fully taken up but that doesnt stop us from travelling. In fact, the Jineng hired a taxi & prepaid the taxi  for us, we thought that was an extra mile towards us because hotel shuttle service is  not an obligation/not compulsory for all hotel guest. \n\nThey even offered a birthday cake for my partner's birthday & the crews waited as late as 10:30pm for us to came back from our shopping & did a surprised turned up at my place.\n\nWe couldnt ask for more, and we were very pleased with our experience with Jineng Villas.",

              "text": "We stayed in a one bedroom villa. I had booked anticipating a true tropical paradise type of escape and I wasn't disappointed. The city outside the gates of the villas may be dirty, noisy and sometimes grim, but once you step inside it's so serene and relaxing. In the morning you wake to the sounds of the birds in the bamboo-covered walkway to the villas. \nThe pool was awesome, crystal clear and always the perfect temperature. The dining/living room area was a separate wing to the main bedroom part of the villa. There was a shower & toilet area dedicated to the pool area, and another bathroom at the other end of the bedroom section, with a bath. \nWe were given a menu to order breakfast for the next day each day. The breakfast was more than enough, and there were a lot of options to choose from. Staff deliver the meal and set it up on the dining table at the time you've specified. \nAll staff were very friendly and helpful. The air conditioning was perfect, the room service was cheap, delicious and good quality, and the cleaning of the room was without fault. \nThe only issue we found was that the wifi wasn't great - it was patchy, kept dropping out, and was really slow. It was free, though, and we ended up buying data SIM from a phone kiosk near Kuta, which was about $10 for 4GB and really fast.\nThere's a Circle-K (like a 7-Eleven) across the road from the reception entrance. They sell alcohol, other drinks, snacks etc. \nThe hotel has a free transport service for the Seminyak area, and if you're looking for something in particular, chances are good that whomever is at the front desk will know where to find it. Ayu was particularly helpful :)",

Good pay TV channels (though not great quality like most of Asia- TV has hdmi DVD and usb though). Breakfasts really amazing.  Staff brilliant.  Couldn't fault the place. Would not visit anywhere else.  they were also happy to shuttle us into Seminyak every day.  Very professional - chased our airline every day for our missing luggage without even being asked.  Highly recommend.",

The shuttle (drop off to Seminyak) was great and we used this quite a bit (remember to tip, fellow travellers!). We paid for a one bedroom villa, but upon checking in, we were told we were upgraded to a two bed room villa. We thought great! But they had locked the second bedroom (we didn't need it anyway). We didn't feel comfortable being in villa M. It was the second last villa at the back, so a very long walk especially travelling with a toddler. The bathroom also seemed exposed to outside and we were a bit worried about the mosquitoes. We requested to be changed the next day to a one bedroom villa and we were SO MUCH HAPPIER. Just something about the decor in villa M. Just didn't feel right. We got moved to villa L and understood the kitchen and living area was much bigger than the two bed villa so glad that we asked to be moved. \nBreakfast was not very extensive but tasty (I ate the same breakfast sandwich for 5 days!). \nInternet unfortunately wasn't available everywhere (i.e. the reception area). Only in your villa, and you had to log in each time you wanted to use it. \nWe used the pool but it was a bit cold as others have explained due to not getting much sun. \nLocation was not fantastic unfortunately. After staying at Courtyard by Marriott, we felt a bit isolated staying at this villa. I did walk back on my own a few times to the villa (fine during the day, but was quite dark at night). \nIn summary, this villa would be great if you are after privacy. Although staff were amazing and personal, we preferred staying at a big hotel where there were other kids/families. \nKeep up the good work though Jineng Villas!",

It really was an amazing villa and lived up to our expectations. \nAlthough I cant compare it to other villas, since I have only stayed in large hotels in bali, I still would highly recommend it to anyone. \nThe staff were very friendly and polite, spoke good english and always willing to help. The drop off service in Seminyak was fantastic! I think we easily saved $50 or more on taxis using this service. Every time we wanted to go and get money changed, go out for dinner or even just to the beach they would be available to drop us there. We stayed in Villa B (2nd from the reception) and we found it very peaceful and relaxing. \nThe staff booked restaurants, motorbikes, tours, white water rafting ect for us which was handy. They even got me a personalised chocolate mud cake for my birthday! I cant really fault this villa and if I had to there isn't any major issues.. just that if you are relatively unfit/lazy I would suggest booking a villa down the front of the place because the bamboo path is quite long, also the breakfast is satisfying, fresh and very filling but dont expect a 5 star quality meal, however for something thats included in the price it is well worth it and saved us lots of money. \nAlso if you love tanning like myself, I found the way the villas are facing only half of the place gets sun, this is not the villas fault just how it is, this however kept our villa alot cooler and if you want to tan you can just move your white chair into the sun like I did. These things should not deter you from staying here. I am normally one to try new places/things but I would definitely stay at the Jineng Villas again.  \nThanks for having us Jineng Villas - M & M :) ",

Staff were well dressed and professional and very helpful as we wanted to do a few things at airport before returning to hotel.  \nHotel staff were all very friendly and helpful where needed throughout the stay.  Drop off in seminyak area was great and we were able to get dropped each time we asked.  \nRoom service was nice... Food was ok for in room food..was good for nights that we were exhausted and could not be bothered to go out.  \nDaily breaky was nice.. We stuck with bacon eggs fruit and French toast.  Powdered milk only.. So we bought our own.  \nAll facilities were working and functioning.. We used in room safe and had no issues with security.  \nOnly issue was poor water pressure or maybe blocked shower head on main shower so we just used the second one...wasnt a big issue.  \nSpraying daily for mosquito's was fine... Only for a few minutes and remade bed and took any dishes away while they were there.  \nLocation was fine... Circle k across the road.. Jineng supermarket 5 Min wall.. 2 routes to the seminyak shopping area.  \nStaff were able to chase up some tour guides who were running late and make dinner bookings if we requested.  \nI rate 5 as I believe services and overall experience was really good and I was really happy overall with our stay.

Only a couple of gripes and really they are just admin issues.  If breakfast is included in your package then it would be nice to have an order form delivered when the room is being serviced, instead of requesting one everyday.   If there is going to be a celebration or public holiday where room service will not be available, guests should possibly be advised, especially if planning a \"night in\" with the children.   Also Maybe  the phones in the two bedrooms could be connecting? Like I said, these are very small things and I would not hesitate to recommend these villas to anyone wishing stay in modern, clean and comfortable villa. In a  fantastic location!",

However the attentive staff allowed us to leave our bags and the free shuttle service dropped us into Seminyak so we could do some sightseeing.\nUpon checking in we were greeted with extremely friendly and knowledgeable  staff. The villa itself was beautiful and well maintained.\nWe mentioned to the staff that the air con in the bedroom wasn't very cold, and when we got back from dinner; they had installed a new unit. \nBreakfast was fantastic every morning. On time and very filling. \nThe only negative we encountered was the room service. \nWhile the food was great. It was not regular. The menu advises that room service is available all day till 10pm. However 2 occasions  (once lunch & once dinner) when we tried to order, we were told that room service wasn't available. \nIf that small aspect had of been on point, it would have been 5 stars. \n\nHopefully we come back soon and can stay again.\nWould definitely recommend.

We thoroughly enjoyed this holiday and highly recommend family and friends to come. Let me detail the pros and cons below.\n\nPros:\n- fully airconed rooms and living room.\n- impeccably clean \n- full function kitchen and full sized fridge.\n- relatively large private pool \n- warm and welcoming staff who frequently went out of their way to help us. Our room rate included one way shuttle to anywhere in Seminyak. However, on several occasion, the staff were willing to drive my parents to a local eatery to buy take-away back to the villa. They even recommended some tasty locals to take us. On one night, one of their staff actually went and bought dinner for us!! \n- good bug control. None of us got any mossie bite in the villa.\n- the in room massages were amazing and soooo reasonably priced!!! \n- tasty breakfast with good selection\n\nRoom for improvement:\n- the delivery of the breakfast could be more consistent. One day, we did not get the fruit platter and another day they missed the bakery basket. But they quickly delivered it to our room on request. \n- the water pressure of the shower could be improved.\n- the sliding doors in the villa makes a loud noise when opening or closing no matter how lightly we slide it. This woke my baby up from sleep many times. \n\nagain, the good points outweighs the bad~ and I would very much return if I visit Bali again~",

From the absolutely spotless rooms to the most helpful and pleasant staff we have ever encountered on our travels. The villas are spacious and very well designed with complete privacy and security. Breakfast was included with our stay and was delicious. The villa was completely cleaned and resupplied every day, the garden and pool lights turned on. even the air conditioner was put on for us so that we returned to nice cool rooms every evening. I cannot praise Jineng enough and I would not waste my time or money looking for better accommodation in Bali because it doesn't exist.The Jineng Villas are 5 Star 10/10. Michael & Felicity B",

The check in was super smooth and the villa staff (Ayu) welcomed us with greatest warmth. We were served  welcome drinks at the reception and later  accompanied to the villa for a quick briefing of the facilities inside. We were allocated Villa F and the villa at first sight was paradise. What you see in pictures is what you get.. Just that its much more beautiful. The pool is a beauty and great in size. The pool does create an illusion of being slightly sloped but is actually 5.5 feet end to end. The staff was prompt in getting a nice floating bed for the pool as I did not know how to swim. We were also taken by surprise to see flower decorations in the bedroom and the bathtub for our honeymoon even though we had not taken the honeymoon package. There was also a special honeymoon cake kept on the table nicely decorated with fresh fruits all around. The refrigerator had 6 complimentary soft drinks and the water bottles were replenished every day. The villa is best viewed in the evening with all the lights on. It really did set the tone for a romantic getaway. Cleanliness at The Jineng is top notch.. towels and bed linen are changed every day. The breakfast menu is also quite decent and needs to be finalized on the prior day. Breakfast was always served hot and on time. It tasted great too. We loved the Indonesian specialities like mie goreng and nasi goreng. The egg preparations were simply yummy. Our package also included an hour long balinese couple massage that was very refreshing and done in the villa itself. I was simply wowed over by the hospitality at The Jineng Villas. I had the entire staff in the villa on 16th morning with a beautiful birthday cake singing the birthday song. It was a great birthday surprise planned by my wife and executed well by the staff. The villa also has free shuttle drop service to nearby places of Seminyak. The staff was also quick to arrange for a bike when needed. Overall it was the best experience for me and my wife. Our special thanks to the entire villa staff (Ayu, Andi, Dikka, Angga, Tejaa and others) for the excellent hospitality. They never said NO to anything. We totally recommend The Jineng Villas to anyone and everyone. \nCons - The breakfast menu could have been a little more elaborate and we were running out of options as we stayed for 6 days. ",

              "text": "If anyone is questioning or hesitating about staying at the Jineng Villas or looking for a place in Seminyak - DO NOT WASTE ANOTHER MINUTE! It is absolutely beautiful and exceeded all expectations that I had. The Jineng Villas is the place to stay. \n\nMy partner and I stayed for 4 blissful nights after staying 4 nights in Kuta and were so overwhelmingly happy as our previous accommodation was disappointing to say the least. We are certainly glad staying at Jineng was at the end of our trip as it was a perfect way to end our holiday. My partner had never been to Bali before, and out of my 3 previous experiences, I had never personally stayed in Seminyak but after our stay at Jineng, there is no question about staying anywhere else when we return in the future. \n\nThe Villas are pristine clean! They were in immaculate condition, open and spacious and the pool after a long day of shopping was just perfect. The food was so delicious, breakfast served fresh every morning and the staff are so well presented and friendly; attending to any need that you may have had. \n\nThe free shuttle service around Seminyak was another added bonus, particularly as we were quite unfamiliar with the surroundings and felt comfort in being taken to popular tourist spots by a friendly face. \n\nThank you Jineng Villas for making our stay more amazing than we could have ever asked for!",

Much larger than other villas we have seen! Staff were fabulous, couldn't do enough to help us, they provide free transport wherever you need to go (provided its within the seminyak/legian area) and when there cars were out & about they paid for our taxi. They were happy to help us make dinner reservations & book activities during the day. Breakfast daily was amazing, always on time! Couldn't fault our stay at Jineng villas & look forward to returning!",

Villas very quiet, no planes and easy to get to by taxi off Sunset Road. The villas are very nice. Two toilets, showers (with exhaust fans) and wash basins. Large main bedroom, large kitchen lounge area. Both separate A/C and TV\u2019s. Good area to get dressed with ample cupboards, dressing table, writing desk. Large  bathroom with spa, large shower. Good size pool that was clean and in the sun. Kitchen has a full size fridge, sink, cook top ECT. Table and chairs and a comfy lounge. Glass doors  open to the pool area. Small garden. Very well lit at night time. Reception is small and everyone is happy. Languages still a problem with staff. They remember your name and willing to help. Will drive you if their cars are available. Free WiFi works ok, drops out all the time, but seems to be normal in Bali? There isn\u2019t a restaurant but they deliver your breakfast each morning. Very nice and well presented. You can order room service, but will come in a plastic bag and plastic covered containers. \nMarble floor very slippy. The pool is hard to get out of, although there is a ledge, no steps, no hand rail. Day beds near the pool you can\u2019t really use, not comfy. They are in the shade and too hard to move around. Bed was a bit hard. \nWould go back, depending on cost.",

Always smiling and make you feel so welcome. Villas are beautiful. The pool at night is a real vision. Delicious breakfast every morning is so nice to wake up to my favourite being strawberry pancakes & smoothie \ud83c\udf38 10/10 would highly recommend! ",

We arrived quite late in the night and when we were shown to our villa our jaws dropped. It was beautiful! Exactly the same as the photos on the website. The breakfasts served in your room every morning were filling and tasty. I've stayed at another villa where the lounge/dining area is open with no door or walls to enclose it, letting Mosquitos and bugs of all kinds in. At Jineng every room is closed off but can be opened. The pool is great. Rooms and bathrooms are spacious. Highly recommend Jineng Villas. If I visit Bali again, Jineng Villas will be the first thing I book!! ",

              "text": "Having stayed at Jineng Villas last year it was an easy decision to return.  Jineng is hidden away on Gang Baik Baik, which is not a lane that travellers would typically walk down so it is not necessarily noticed.  But Jineng is a gem - the villas are well designed and offer privacy, space and comfort in an understated way.  The pool is a reasonable size, although if you have mobility issues, it is not that easy to get out of as there are no steps in the pool.  Breakfast is great - cooked on site, it is served hot and fresh with a good range of options.  Staff are fabulous and very helpful - the shuttle service within Seminyak is an added bonus and makes the short trip to Bintang Supermarket or Jl Laksamana easy.  While there is nothing on offer in Gang Baik Baik, Jl Nakula takes you to Double 6 within 15 minutes of walking.  Last year we discovered Hammerhead Gym which is about a ten minute walk along Jl Nakula in the opposite direction.  Unless you want quick access to the beach, the location of Jineng Villas is not a problem - taxi drivers know the area well. At USD135 a night, Jineng is really good value for money. We plan to stay there again on our next trip to Bali.",

The rooms are clean and tidy, the pool lovely (and warm - unusual in the private villas, most of them in the past have been freezing) and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Being able to close up the dining area and cool it was another added bonus not normally found in villas. The only criticism was the upstairs room was still a bit warm - even with the aircon going full bore. The location was great - close to the beach for kids surf lessons, not too far from Waterbom and not too far to Seminyak for all the great restaurants. We will definitely consider staying here again.",

We have stayed in many hotels in our travels but this one is right up there.\nWe had  such an amazing time, we looked at the reviews a few weeks before we arrived hoping the positive reviews that we were reading were true. They sure were!\n \nThe pics on the website are all accurate and it looks even better in real life. We were in Villa K towards the back and could not fault the level of service and genuine warmth of all the staff in which we engaged with. Never was anything too difficult all always done with a big smile. Seeing and engaging with them was a true daily delight, they are a credit to the Hotel.\n\nThe villa was always really clean and the pool was just awesome.\nWe loved the breakfasts in the morning which we always delivered on time although the coffee could be improved a bit, proper machine coffee would be great. The evening touch ups to the villa which included fresh towels for our evening swim and also a comprehensive mosquito spray.This was done whilst we were out for our evening meal. \n\nThe local take away service we used for dinner a few times also really yummy, fairly priced and prompt.The free shuttle service to and from the airport was great as was the free shuttle service within Seminyak which we used daily. We brought our 9 month old son and all the staff were so lovely and warm with him, he was like a celebrity.\n\nThe villas are only a 7-8 min walk up the Seminyak Rd and Bintang Supermarket and its a nice walk as you pass other villas and some private homes and gardens.\nAlso there's a mini mart across the road which was handy to pick up last minute things.\nAlso its  a short walk to a few quality restaurants especially Malo's for one of the best steaks I have ever eaten. We had a few massages next door also.\n\nThank you Jineng Villas we hope to visit you again!.",

My partner and I had never been to Bali before and was a bit nervous but we were soon made at ease once we arrived at Jineng Villas. The staff were amazing, nothing is too much trouble, the breakfast is really decent, the rooms are so big, spacious and clean.. the pool was the best bit!\n\nThe only downside to my experience was that my hair went extremely green from the pool, so blonde travellers be careful of putting your head under completely!\n\n Would recommend this to anyone to stay here :)",

They are very friendly, humble & helping. I would like to name Mr.Dikka & the lady in the reception. \n\n2. Spacious bedroom, dining & living room. \n\n3. Extremely clean. \n\n4. Bathroom has Jacuzzi.\n\n5. Free pick up & drop from the airport. \n\n6. Good swimming pool. \n\n7. Good breakfast. Sandwich was really tasty. \n\n8. Modern & classy interior design. \n\n9. Well maintained garden. \n\nCons \n\n1. Small AC for a big room. It takes lot of time to cool up the room. Seems like its a 1 ton AC. A minimum of 1.5 - 2 ton AC is required in such a big room. \n\n2. Leaves from the garden around the pool falls in the water. \n\nI'll definitely stay here next time when Im in Bali.",

The one bedroom Villa by itself was huge, had a great swimming pool which was cleaned regularly. The staff is just amazing, always smiling and happy to help. The only downside is the location, if you are walking alone in the night, it is quite dark to go through the small lanes. But they have a free drop service anywhere in Seminyak whenever you want it, that was great. All in all I would recommend this hotel for sure and would love to go back and stay here next time I am in Bali.",

We were greeted at the airport as part of the service they offer and from the warm welcome at check-in we felt that Jineng was a tropical home away from home. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and clean. Spent many hours relaxing in and around the private pool during our 5 night stay and the water was the perfect temperature. The Villas offer a massage service in the room that is professional and great value. We stayed during Nyepi and this was not an inconvenience as meals were pre-ordered and brought to us in the Villa. The daily breakfast options are healthy and tasty. The Villas are approx 20 minute walk to Seminyak main streets and the Villas offer a free shuttle service, but there are lots of restaurants, spas and shops within 5 minute walk. We used the hotels driver on our last day for 8 hours to take us to our next hotel in Ubud and also to do sight seeing tour. He was very friendly, helpful and had good suggestions on places to see in the area. We would definitely stay at Jineng Villas again and will be recommending it to my family and friends. The experiences at Jineng Villas makes us want to return to Bali again soon!!!",

              "text": "It's always a bit of a risk choosing a place to stay from the pictures on websites.  Most everything looks pretty good.  The customer reviews paint the truest picture however.  For Jineng those written reviews were highly praiseworthy with the odd whine, but you can't please everyone, even when it's near to perfect.  We arrived, and at first it seemed like an out of the way location from the main strip, but it actually wasn't once we found the maze of laneways to take you to where all the restaurants and shops are.  Check in was charming, staff were delightful, and we were escorted along a walkway arched with bamboo which was beautiful in itself.  Only second villa back from the road but completely quiet, and lovely ambience particularly at night.  The moment of truth is when you walk through the gate and hope to see what you came for (especially when you're going to be there for a week), an oasis of calm and the retreat you need.  It did not disappoint.  Nice big generous private pool, and beautiful bedrooms with really comfortable beds.  The living area was separate from the bedrooms and air conditioned.  Most I have stayed at are open air, which is also nice, but it was good to have a retreat from the heat other than your bedroom when you needed to chill.\nIt was more than walking distance (though do-able) to places like Breeze and other renowned restaurants, but the hotel provided a free service to anywhere you wanted to go daily.  If their private car was otherwise occupied, e.g. with airport pick-ups, they would arrange a taxi, direct them to where you wanted to go and pick up the tab.\nI had trouble getting connected to internet initially and the staff were prompt and amazing at getting it sorted.\nI will certainly go again, and in fact my travelling companion in February booked the same place for April to go again with other friends.",

              "text": "Stayed 5 nights with a friend in a 2 bedroom (villa b)\n\nVillas\nLiked the fact that the living room/kitchen were closed off but separate from the bedrooms. Meant we had a place to cool off and escape the heat and inevitable Mosquitos. Kitchen was well equipt and water was replenished daily. \n\n2 bedrooms were identical, one on ground floor with access to the pool and one directly above with a balcony so no arguments over who gets the better room :-)\n\nPool was clean and large enough to war and paddle around. Only thing that I would say could be improved would be to get sun beds that could fully recline. The beds while funky looking and fairly comfortable to sit in meant you could never lie on your stomach. \n\nBathrooms were large and clean, DVD player and TV in each bedroom with lots of storage and working space. \n\nBreakfast\nGreat choice of breakfast cooked\nTo order. My friend and I ate at different times and breakfast always arrived on time served with a smile. Ordered a few items off\nThe breakfast menu - everything was delicious \n\nService \nFantastic! All staff are very warm and friendly from receptionists to housekeeping staff who came not just to make up rooms but returned every evening to spray the rooms. \nReceptionists took every opportunity to address us by name and to do everything to make our stay enjoyable. When my friend was unable to connect to common wifi for a work call, they installed a separate modem in our villa. \nFree shuttle service or taxi to seminyak was a lovely idea\n\nLocation \nOn a quiet street within walking distance from the main shopping and dining street and 15 minute walk from double 6 beach. \n\nThere are 2 bicycles available for hotel guests which were a great idea but I didn't manage to make use of. \n\nIt was hard to leave and i can't wait to return next month.

We had a 3 year old and a 10 month old and they were very accommodating. We requested a cot and high chair, which were waiting in our villa when we arrived. The breakfast was great and our 3 year old loved the pool. One of the reasons that we booked this villa is that every living area can be closed off from the outside, meaning keeping the mozzies away at night, but they weren't that bad. The staff also lay mozzie coils and give a quick spray every evening. The drop off service was also great and they didn't mind that the 10 month old got cranky waiting in traffic. If the vans were out then they would organise and pay for a taxi if going to the local area. The villas were clean and they even picked up some of the toys we brought that were scattered around and placed neatly.  We had the front 2 bedroom villa near the road but couldn't hear any noise. Its also a short walk to the main road through Seminyak and we did this regularly to change money and visit shops. I will book again if its just the wife and I or the family again. \nRyan",

The staff were some of the greatest people that I have ever come across in any of my travels, you often read in reviews  that staff go above and beyond, in this case, it is definitely  true.  The size and quality of this villa has to be experienced, we stayed for 7 nights and were sad to leave.  Breakfast is served in your villa and is delicious, fresh and plenty of it.  We travelled with another couple and would alternate villas each morning for breakfast, again always on time and yum.   The pool was the perfect temperature and nice and big getting the perfect amount of sun.  It was a 5 - 10 minute \"stroll\" to Bintang Supermarket, a Mini Mart over the road and  Massage next door, everything you need at your finger tips.",

The villas are lovely, give you everything you need and the pool is really well maintained. The breakfast selection was exceptional and they bring it to your room every morning whenever you like from between 7am-11am which was great when you fancied a lazy morning. The staff were so attentive, literally ask them anything and they an do it for you. They booked us tables, brought us water in the middle of the night when my boyfriend was unwell and just in general they have a great attitude! Another great thing is that included in the price is a shuttle service which they will drive to anywhere within the Seminyak area which we used everyday. Overall this place was great and I would recommend it to anyone- young families, couples and girls holiday. If you fancy a well earned break, this is the place to go!",

Probably it is only my villa which has the issues.\n\nThe cons.\nThis being a 3 year old (approximately) property, badly require some serious maintenance. A few items in the room are not working. The water does not drain well after the shower. The bathtub requires at least two rounds of cleaning before brownish water stop coming out from the tap. The hairdryer malfunctioned on the first night we used it. There are many huge cockroaches in our villa. Everyday we would kill two.\n\nThe Pros\nThe rate is affordable for the size and swimming pool in the villa. The staff are very friendly and respond immediately to our requests every time. The breakfast was served cold on the first morning and we requested for hot breakfast subsequently and our requests were met. The one way transport to nearby places were provided. The staff reacted instantly and apologetically to our complaint on the cockroach issues.\n\nOverall I think there are plenty of other accommodation options around, therfore I would think twice before I come back.\n",

We loved how private the villas are, the pool was a great treat any time of the day, and house keeping was exceptional. The breakfast was fantastic and served at your chosen time. The shops and the Bintang supermarket are only about a 10min walk away or you can organise a driver from reception to take you free of charge. All the staff at the Jineng Villas are beautiful, they make you feel so welcome and nothing is too much trouble. They even came to our villa with a birthday cake and sang me happy birthday. We all had a full body massage in our rooms which I do recommend after a long day of shopping. A big thankyou to Ayu and Madie who made our stay extra special. I highly recommend Jineng Villas and we will definitely be back.",

The most wonderful event was when the staff send a cake  and sang birthday song to my husband right at the door!! which coincidentally falls on the same day as their festive celebration- Kuningan!.  The Jineng makes us feel like home with kitchenette, pots, pans etc made available for us to cook! And not forgetting the enormous portion of breakfast for us (which can actually last us up to dinner time).  Free shuttle service (via taxi) around Seminyak!  The private pool is clean. \nA MUST STAY I SAY!!!",

The\u00a0 kitchen and sitting area is closed off which is a big plus considering it gets very hot and there are alot of mosquitoes around. The pool is a great size and depth with a lovely outdoor area to relax.\u00a0 The bedroom and bathroom are very spacious. The staff are absolutely amazing and will do everything in their power to make sure you have a relaxed holiday.\u00a0 Breakfast served daily in the room was a perfect touch.\u00a0 I loved putting my order through each night and looked forward to a private breakfast delivered at the time we chose each morning.\u00a0 The drop off service in seminyak is also fabulous.\u00a0 The staff will arrange thier own service or a paid taxi drop off to anywhere in seminyak you'd like to go.\u00a0 There was never any waiting around to get to places.\u00a0 It's about a 10minute walk into the strip of shops or a short bike ride.\u00a0 We enjoy walking and we loved borrowing the bikes to go around,\u00a0 so no problem for us. The villas are also very private with high walls and lovely trees. Also free drinks in the mini bar and free DVDs =awesome. And we had in-room massages as part of our stay package which was so lovely too. No complaints at all. We will definitely stay here again. ",

My partner and I stayed here for 12 nights and were waited on hand and foot by the fantastic staff (especially Andi & Ayu). They did everything from organise day trips to ensuring that we were able to utilize their shuttle service at every request. It was like having fairies look after us - we would leave our room and by the time we returned fresh towels and linen had been provided and changed. Our only issue were Mosquitos which staff ensured that coils and insect spray were provided twice a day. On several occasions the complimentary shuttle service was in use and the staff apologized repeatedly and insisted they pay our taxi fare to our destinations. A short walk To the supermarket and the beach. Perfect place in   Seminyak! ",

I planned everything down to the tee and had even requested the villas to help make the room a little extra special for our arrival as I had planned to pop the question once we arrived. Let's just say the service was appalling, the staff gave away the proposal before I had a chance to ask my partner. \n\nDuring our stay our expensive toiletries were broken, the manager Ms Line was rude, unapologetic and very unhelpful. The food was below standard. The linen was off white and the bath was dirty with sand in the bottom. The staff seemed stoned or not with it. I would never stay here again or ever recommend for anyone to stay here.",

The staff were so friendly and  helpful with any requests, breakfast was delicious (especially the strawberry pancakes!) and was served exactly at the requested time each morning. The beach is about a 10 minute walk, but that gives you time to look at the shops on the way, or the free shuttle can drop you down there if you want to avoid the hustle-bustle.  Would definitely stay here again.",

My wife and I had compared other villas in Bali within the same price range and we found that The Jineng Villas was the only villa that offered air-conditioned living room in that range. Furthermore, we were afraid of staying in a villa with an open space living room especially in Bali because of mosquitoes. Thus, the air-conditioned living room was definitely a plus point and at least we were able to relax in the living room during the evenings without direct contact with mosquitoes as compared to open space living room. The staff was friendly and helpful as well. They were willing to accommodate to our request for late checkout prior to our departure for the airport to take a quick shower even though the place was fully booked on that day.",

Fabulously close to all the venues we frequently visit, and new ones we discovered! Bintang Supermarket is only a 15 minute stroll down the lane next to the villas, bicycles are available as is the 'taksi' rank just down the road. Staff are so welcoming and seem to enjoy their work and helping visitors wherever possible.  Villas are clean and provide a good base to work from. Hot water readily available and linen/towels always clean and refreshed everyday. Photos give a very true representation of the villas, don't be disappointed! A couple of things a 'westerner' would probably like to see provided, something to hang wet bathers on and more crockery/glassware options to be provided. The pool can be a little difficult for the less agile to get out (please be wary with small children!). Highly recommend staying with Jineng VIllas",

              "text": "My husband and I stayed at Jineng Villas in early October for 4 nights. It was our first trip to Bali and we hit the jackpot with this accomodation. We had an early flight into Denpasar arriving at 7.30am. The driver from the villa was waiting out the front for pick up back to Seminyak. Because it was so early we were expecting to drop our luggage off and go and explore until check in but they checked us in on the spot and showed us to our amazeballs villa. What ever we requested from the front desk, from dinner reservations to spa reservations, they couldn't help us enough. Being always greeted with a smile from each and every staff member we encountered made our stay there so wonderful. \nThe complimentary transport into anywhere in Seminyak was a fantastic feature we used many times. \nOur only slight disappointment was with the room service food. It is prepared by an off site cafe down the road and for a container not even half full of chips, 6 nuggets and some bruschetta it was overpriced and did not come close to meeting our already low expectations. \nOverall we had a fantastic stay at Jineng and will be recommending it to family and friends who will be visiting Seminyak in the future.

We located made our booking via Wotif through convenience and had no idea what a treat we had gotten ourselves in for.\nThe Villa was beautiful, clean and tidy and the staff were friendly and helpful to boot.\nRooms were cleaned daily, with staff taking note of when you left to ensure that it was completed in your absence. Though if you were in your room, and still wanted it clean, the staff were very considerate of you.\nOnly difficulties were communicating by phone with reception as a result of the language barrier, face to face is much easier and also the floors were quite slippery when wet, though we didn't have any accidents there were a few near misses.\n\nFacilities were fantastic, anything that wasn't in your room you could ask for and it was never too much trouble. No extra charges at the end - a problem we've had previously in Bali.\n\nAll transfers within Seminyak were free - this was really handy!",

Drop off to Seminyak when required was great! We are getting married in Bali next year and will be using Jineng Villas as one of our suggested accommodation for our guests.

The staff are so helpful and friendly, they will help you with anything if you need it! Service is exceptional here! The rooms are amazing too- for two people the one bedroom villa has more than enough space. The private pool is fantastic. The beds are super comfy and huge and are always made up for you when you return after a day out. The location is great because it's tucked away from the busy and noisy seminyak area. It's a quick 10minute walk to double six beach- great for dinner/drinks on the beach. Everything else is a short cab ride away. Very convenient! \nI will recommend the Jineng Villa's to everyone I know travelling to Bali. It's a must stay for such a reasonable price!  ",

The bed was so big we had different post codes lol. We could not say a bad thing about this place. The staff were always doing things around the place to keep it maintained at a high level, the cleaning staff were friendly and did a wonderful job every day. It was very nice to have our own private pool and breakfast delivered every morning. The villas are a quick 3 minute walk from the bintang market in seminyak and about 15 minute walk to the beach, although having been to Bali many times, the beach has no attraction for us anymore so it wasn't a problem. We couldn't speak highly enough of this establishment, we didn't want for anything and everything we asked for or they thought we needed was done with a smile",

As this is a smaller lot of villas, the staff easily paid attention to our every need, providing us with the most relevant information and happily giving directions where necessary. The villa its self was very spacious and clean, decorated in true bali style. Daily breakfast was served in your room (a true luxury!) The Jineng Villas are located a bit further out than originally expected, but the staff provide a free taxi service making it easy to get around and into the middle of Seminyak. Perfect spot for couples, larger villas available for families or groups.",

Although the hotel doesn't have any common facilities (e.g. restaurants, large shared swimming pool, gym, bars; as far as we know), this doesn't affect any of our feeling of staying there, because our room including pool, kitchen, TV room, etc is just so nice enough. Breakfasts and drinks are good. More importantly, the hotel staffs are very friendly and helpful. Our stay is very comfortable. \n\nThey offer free car transfer, so you can easily go to the night markets, grocery stores or other shops nearby (they're indeed just very near ~10mins walk, but note that the walk to there, especially at night, is not that easy because of poor pavement, busy traffic and darkness; Anyway, the local people said that the area is safe - which is true at least in our experience).\n\nTwo, perhaps negative, comments:\n- Insects are around in the room, but I guess you can't find a insect-free (esp, with pool) hotel in Bali.\n- Not at beach area but you can use their free drive to the nearby beach I guess (not tried).\n- No good view, but you can't expect more with such a good price for a pool-villa.\n\nIn general, we enjoy our stay there very much.",

The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the villa was clean, bright and fresh.  On return to the villa each day we would find he bed turned down and a mosquito candle lit.  Was a fantastic romantic week. Would definitely come back again. 2 very small criticisms - the pool furniture looked great but was not the most comfortable, and breakfast was a little cold by the time it as delivered.  Will highly recommend jining villas",

It was quiet & peaceful, away from the traffic noise, smells, pollution. Staff were very friendly & helpful.",

The place itself is close to the main street, about 10 mins walk or $2-$3 cab ride to the center of main road, and about $5 to hot spots like Potato head. The villa offers complimentary transportation either with their own van or pay the cab for us if its reasonable distance, they organise it all so you can simply step out to the reception and tell them where you would like to go and you are off in a minute or two, no hassle with communication with taxi drivers at all. The villa itself was very clean all the time, breakfasts were nice and generous in size from a good range menu and didn't get us sick at all! The villa was nice and quiet and great to have the private pool to ourselves. I can't imagine a better experience here for visiting the first time. Big thank you to the lovely staffs there, highly recommended and will definitely go back!",

I had been sick the day we got to the Villa with Bali Belly and they were all very concerned and were glad to hear that I felt better the next day.\nThe complimentary mini bar with water was fantastic! The bed, the bathroom, the pool; everything was luxury. The complimentray Taxi service was a huge help too.\n ALthough there was a slight mishap with the drainage in the bathtroom but after a  call to reception, an engineer promptly arrived to inspect.\nI only wish could have stayed longer than one night. We will definatley be back :)\n\nTerima Kasih Jineng Villas!",

The rooms were spacious and comfortable and the staff is extremely hospitable and attend to a guest's every need. The location is slightly far from the city centre but nothing that one can't walk. In addition, the resort gives a complimentary cab service anywhere in Seminyak. The management is gracious and never gave us a reason to complain. Overall, we had an extremely comfortable and happy stay at very affordable prices. I highly recommend Jineng villas to anyone.",

Air conditioning was great and welcoming,villa was always cleaned.pancakes a must for breakfast,and also omlette.\nThe staff were excellent, they went out of their way to accommandate any request,and the free shuttle into Seminyak was a bonus(to far to walk if you are not young) in saying this a taxi was cheap and plentiful to get to and from the villa.\nIt was our wedding anniversary and the staff had recommended a resturant for dinner(La Lucciola) fantastic sunset and meal on the beach 15min away) on our return we were surprised with swan towels and rose stems, heart made of flower petals on the floor,then to find the spa filled with water and floating petal with I luv U spelt in them,then found a beautiful choc heart cake with happy anniversary in the fridge. this was heart felt and made us feel very special,again thank you to all the staff.\nAll in all we enjoyed our stay and would recommend this villa if you are looking for a villa close to Seminyak with private pool.",

The couple of little maintenance issues that arose were promptly dealt with.\nThe service was very good and the free breakfasts were also very good.\nI recommend The Orchard restaurant 2 minute walk away.\nThe Spa next door is cheap but would rather spend a couple of dollars more and get   much better treatments.\nThere is a little shop out the front. Although the Bintang \nSupermarket is literally a 5 minute walk away. \nThere is a brand new Kentucky Fried Chicken on the corner...6 minute walk.\nThere is also a little Italian restaurant which does amazing Pizzas just a two minute walk .\nWe would stay here again.",

Ample hanging and cupboard space with a large bathroom and quality floor tiling everywhere. \nThe location here is central to both Legion and Seminyak with the Bintang Market only a 5 minute walk.\nOnly drawback is poor internet during the day but good early morning and at night.\nThe Villas need some maintenance and a little more effort to brighten the place up. \nIn general more than happy to stay here again and as usual all staff are friendly and attentive to their duties. \nWell done all.",

Jineng Villas are rated I believe using the \u201cBali scale\u201d because they are definitely not 4+ star rated accommodation. \nThe rooms are spotlessly clean but the building itself hasn\u2019t seen much maintenance. The pool is unusable for us because the only step in is 600mm from the top! I actually fell in and had trouble getting out! So for the older person or children this is an extreme hazard. Bathroom shower area mouldy tiles everywhere and a lack of ammenities including toilet paper!\nThe food is passable but the servings are small (and we\u2019re not big eaters either). Be sure to ask for milk for your fridge too.\nOverall the Jineng I\u2019d consider to be a 3 star saved by polite and welcoming staff and a comfortable bed.",

Fridge stocked on arrival with a couple of complimentary beers and sodas. There is a separate shower out by the pool and a fabulous bathroom next to the bedroom. We had breakfast provided and was tasty and varied but be careful of the mushrooms on toast...loaded with garlic! We also had afternoon tea provided meaning we didn\u2019t eat dinner on several occasions. All the staff helpful. We had friends visit so we booked a BBQ, food fantastic and we had to tell them to stop cooking after we\u2019ed all had a dozen satay, plus fish, chicken, and salads. The negative....the bed is like a plank of wood and rock hard pillows. Plus we understood late checkout was possible as our flight was at midnight but were told this was not possible, but late in our stay they told us we could stay late but we had to move to a different villa, which seemed identical and we had to pay $100. Left us less than impressed.",

The private pool was big enough to have a good swim each day/night and was cleaned twice daily.\n\nFree shuttle transfer to and from the airport was part of the stay and this takes about 20 mins to get there which is great.\n\nThe staff at Jineng were so attentive, friendly and professional.  Special mention to Tari who was such a lovely person and so kind and helpful to me and made sure that everything was perfect during my stay.  \n\nAlso within walking distance to plenty of shops, spas, restaurants and bars.\n\nI will certainly be back to stay here again and my wife will be coming along too.  Great work Jineng and looking forward to staying with you again soon.\n\nMartin :) ",

If the shuttle isn't available they will pay for a taxi.  There were several times were the taxi took too long to come so we ended up walking, we were there over Xmas so traffic was very bad.\nThe staff were great & very helpful.\nAs others have mentioned getting in & out of the pool could be challenging if you are short or have knee issues.  I fall into both these categories, so it was very challenging as there is only 1 ledge which is quite high.  I spoke to the manager & they put a little weatherproof outdoor table in the water which helped a lot.  The pool was a great size & ours got lots of sun (villa J).",

              "text": "Very relaxing stay at Jineng Villas. We stayed for 13 nights in September 2018 in Villa J, and would thoroughly recommend staying here.\n\nThe villas are in a quiet laneway away from the busy streets, though these are only a five minute walk away. Across the road is a small 24hr Circle K which sells a range or drinks, snacks, and toiletries. Next door is a spa, and a couple of nice restaurants including a pizza place, and the Orchard pub are within a two minute walk. \n\nOur villa was located around a private pool, with a dining/lounge/kitchen room located off to one side via a sliding door. At the end of the pool another sliding door leads to your bedroom/bathroom. These two rooms are not connected internally, but instead a small deck and pathway connect these two rooms. In between is a second small bathroom which contains a shower, basin and toilet. The small deck contains a small table and two lounging chairs with a small drying rack, and a basket with two umbrellas.\n\nThe bedroom contains the usual accompaniments including a wardrobe, safe, TV, desk, phone, etc. It also came with a DVD player, a plug convertor, and an electronic mosquito repellent plug. The bathroom contains a bath, separated shower, toilet, and basin. A hair dryer and toiletries are supplied.\n\nThe kitchen contains a full size fridge, toaster, jug, cutlery, cups, glasses, wine/bottle opener, chopping board, and a pan and pot. Their are two gas hobs for cooking. There is also a 4 seat dining table, a couch and a second TV in this room.\n\nYou could get a full service clean each day, or you can just ask for things to be replaced such as towels or water etc.. The room itself was reasonably tidy, though had a little wear and tear. The curtains could have done with a clean, but this was a biggie to us. Some other reviewers have complained about the bed, but we though this was good.\n\nBreakfast is order a la carte style the day before and delivered to your room at the time you have specified the next morning. There is a large variety of choice. Also as we had a scoopon deal for part of our stay we could order lunch or dinner off the menu room service style. All the breakfasts and other meals we had were great. I have attached photos of the menus with this review for those interested.\n\nStaff over all were really friendly and helpful if asked. A great bonus was the free drop off to anywhere in the local area. As other reviewers have mentioned if the villa van is not available they will organise and pay for a taxi to take you instead which was great. A turrn down service was also provided around dusk where each of the rooms were sprayed, curtains pulled, and bed made (if it is unmade).\n\nLastly the pool itself was great. It is reasonably deep, with no shallow end. It has a ledge running down the side which acts as a single step. Those with mobility issues, or if you are a bit olderr might have difficulties getting out of the pool, though we had no issues.",

Our breakfast are always severed on time! \n\nThe free shuttle to airport is just fantastic! Our driver Aguny helped us look for a foreign bank branch and waited for us for a long time.\n\nYou may request anything from front desk, like transportation or even pre-wedding photography! We have to convey a big thank-you to Andi, who helped out our last minute request for pre-wedding photo taking, which makes our holidays in Bali unforgettable. \n\nWe will definitely recommend this villa.",

There is no restaurant on the premises so the lovely thing is your meals are delivered to your villa, we found that wonderful as there was no rush to be up showered ,dressed and at breakfast...made for a really relaxing time.  The pools is 7 metres long and nice and deep so not a small plunge pool, the only comment I will make is it can be a little difficult to get out of , i have a knee injury and managed okay but a handrail attached to the post at the end would be helpful.  There is a huge bathroom with spa bath and seperate toilet/ shower out by the pool, the kitchen comes with a full size fridge and over the road is  Circle K which sells Bintang and vodka cruisers etc. The best place to eat is 2 minutes walk down the lane to The Orchard whic boasts the best fish n chips in Bali and they are correct, great food ans music and open till 12pm. The staff at the villas are young but they are so friendly and professional and nothing is too much trouble. I highly recommend here if you want quiet, relaxed and privacy.. ",

Superb and restful experience........ and Seminyak is just a small distance away and they shuttle you and drop you off....cab back 3 or 4 $'s.",

              "text": "Stayed here during Nyepi, so things we a bit disorganised with a lot of staff on leave. Staff were friendly enough but seemed a bit disinterested. Probably because of Nyepi but still we work many holidays at home so know we still have to do a good job.Confined to villa for the day which was fine. Pool is lovely and aircon is very effective. Food was average. Things that need to change. They need to buy pool ladders! The pool can be quite hard to get out of especially for us older folk. Also instead of supplying single use bottled water, supply refillable water cooler h2o as we have seen in other places in Bali.  The plastic pollution is terrible and getting worse. ",

Bathrooms were nice and everything was very clean. Planning a trip back next spring and will stay here again for part of my trip.",

The pool was beautiful, it's the biggest pool I've had in a villa. It was also so quiet, which made it so easy to just relax\n\nFood was great, if we didn't feel like going out to eat we were always happy with the food that was on offer.\n\nThe free shuttle bus around Seminyak is great, if it wasn't available they would order and pay for a taxi.\n\nI will be staying here again on my next trip!",

              "text": "We cannot say average but neither can we say very good, we are here on a Scoopon Deal for 7 days and to be fair we wouldn't want to have paid full price, contrary to what other people have said in their reviews it definitely is not fantastic,  it's ok, not bad but not fantastic. Our villa I is a 1 bedroom villa with a lounge/kitchen/diner, our deal included daily breakfast which is adequate,  lunch or dinner each day which is limited to the same main menu which again if you like is adequate, I actually intended to cook on an odd occasion but with only a small saucepan and small frypan no microwave no basins then it would prove difficult. The minibar consisted of 2 cokes & 2 lemonades. Complimentary bottled water is provided. The villa has potential but unfortunately needs some maintenance/decorating, the curtains are in very bad need of laundering, the large king bed is hard and creaky and the pool is dangerously deep at 150cm right through with no low end, very difficult to get in and out with no steps or handrail. No pool fench for families with small children. The villa was cleaned everyday with fresh towels and i actually think the bed was chaged each day too. I wouldn't put anyone off from coming here but i certainly wouldn't rely on the fantastic reviews either. In my opinion it always deoends on the expectations of the individual and what we are used to at home, for me personally i expect the same standards as at home or hopefully better than at home but inveriabaly this rarely happens. Today i have just witnessed the housekeeper cleaning our villa, she carries a box with her cleaning cloths, sprays etc and she took out a toilet brush to scrub the inside of our toilet she then just put it back in the box touching the cloths with it, one of those cloths she actually cleaned the kitchen with.  OMG now we know why we get gastric infections and all of this time we've thought it was due to the water or food. Surely to god if they are to use a toilet brush it should be kept in each villa and not shared between every single villa. I don't blame the lovely girl, i blame the manager as he is responsible for the correct training and cleaning procedures. Talk about what the eye doesn't see the heart doesn't grieve about!  ",

              "text": "We stayed in a 1 bedroom villa for 4 nights . This is a peaceful quite place away from the noisy street even though the market is 5 min walk away. There is a 24/7 store just outside the villa where you get almost everything eatables,Liquor , cigarettes etc. Double six beach is at a walk-able distance of 10-15 minutes where you have lots of dining options at the shore. There is a Taxi stand and two wheeler for rent just outside the villa. About the villa- Villa has a parking in front of it and we were parking our two wheeler which we took on rent during our stay there. The place is very clean and tidy. The pool in the villa is just amazing with the pool lights switched on till 12 am. Pool was cleaned daily and the water was so clear. For the sake of saying a negative point (not very serious though)- the water pressure was slightly low especially in the shower.  Villa which we took had one bedroom two bathroom of which one was pretty big with a separate shower area and a Jacuzzi. It had a drawing hall with Kitchen attached to it and of course an amazing pool. The pathway to villa is really good surrounded by bamboo which looks really cool at night with all those lights.\nI would recommend this place for travelers who wish to have some private and amazing experience during their vacation in Bali.",

The staff are absolutely outstanding and the service is fantastic. Villa is gorgeous and the pool is absolute heaven!!! The only downsides for me would be very very minor - the pillows are to high and hard, shower pressure isn't that great and if you want to sunbake take a lilo as you can really only sunbake in the pool. $2 taxi into Legian to our favourite massage place :). Padma is 5 star and Jineng 4 star - which would I choose again? Jineng in a heartbeat. Safe, extremely clean, gorgeous and you can't beat the staff who are an absolute asset!!!",

The room was clean, quiet and beautiful. Wifi was fast and worked most of the time. The resort gave us a complimentary two way airport transfer service, so u don't need a cab. Also they provide one way shuttle service within Seminyak. And the daily breakfast was great, but a bit little for my partner. Overall, we are very pleased for everything and definitely will recommend to all my friends. Thanks again The Jineng Villa.",

One side of the street is full of various Villas and the other side is still being developed. These Villas are  clean and well appointed. The staff are always on hand to help with all your needs. These villas are private. There are only 12 villas in the complex, 21 rooms available from 1, 2 and 3 bedrooms. The staff are on hand to take you anywhere in the Seminyak area. When a car is unavailable a taxi is called and paid for by the Villas. This service was great as some of the best restaurants are in the area. The rooms are sprayed for bugs every evening, the rooms are cleaned and linen is replaced every day. Overall with the great package incentives this place and their staff are great. Would definitely stay again.",

Huge comfory bed. Staff were brilliant and  incrediblynice and helpful at all times. Was easy to get around as it is close to shops, restaurants etc. They can drop you further in Seminyak for more shopping and eating.  Close enough to Legian and Kuta but far away enough to be more exclusive. Pick up at airport was great especially as our plane was one hour late.  No dramas at all and it was a paradise to come home to every day after tours every day.  I highly recommend this place and would go back there in a minute to stay again.  Loved it :-)",

The complimentary airport pick up and drop off was smooth and the villa also offer drop off in seminyak area which we used most days. It's a nominal cab fee to return. Bintang shopping centre is a 10 min walk away so restaurants and retail stores are not far away. The villa location is quiet where you don't hear too much traffic. The villa itself was very clean modern had 2 rooms (2 storey) each having king size beds massive bathrooms in each TV DVDs. It also has a separate lounge dining area kitchen large fridge. Each room has sliding doors and great aircon. Pool is 9m by 3m.  Staff are polite and always willing to help and assist with any issues. Breakfast is served at your villa and it brought a nice start to our day. The villa also had a meal delivery service for lunch or dinner if you prefer to stay in which I used and enjoyed. Looking forward to returning in the near future. ",

Even though there were occupants in the villas next to us, we couldn't hear a thing, so the villa is really nicely intimate and lovely.  \n\nThe bathrooms were just awesome.  We were all squealing \"oooohhhh gorgeous!!\" when the staff were giving us a room tour.  (Check-in is IN your villa, btw.)  \n\nFree refreshments (can drinks etc) for one round.  \n\nBreakfast was good.  They will set up the whole table for you in your villa at a time of your convenience.  But they don't do early breakfast (we checked out at 7am, and they only start serving breakfast at 7.30am... they refuse to do an early breakfast for us.)\n\nThe cons :\n\n*  Jineng Villas will charge you for babycot - USD15 per night.  \n*  The shuttle service is only drop-off.  No pick-up.  You have to take a cab back to the villa, so please ensure you have the address with you coz most taxi-drivers had NO idea where Jineng Villas is located at.\n*  The location is really awful, in some back alley or something.... it was so dark, you basically cannot walk anywhere at all.  \n*  Pool is kinda deep, around 1.5m, so if you are bringing kids who can't swim, make sure you bring some floats.  \n*  Lots of insects, but heard that is inevitable in villas in Bali.  \n\nMost importantly, Jineng Villas please update your contact information!!  We tried sooo hard to contact them to inform them of some changes in our booking, and only upon reaching the villa were we informed that the contact info on their websites were wrong!!",

I am pleased to hear that you very much loved the experience you had while at the same time found THE JINENG VILLAS deliver the best value for what your spend. I am very happy to read that our team members were all very friendly and looked after you very well. We also highly value the constructive feedbacks you shared where we are committed to address and we believe will help us to persistently improve. \r\n\r\nPlease allow me to share some immediate follow up we have implemented including: we will cater early breakfast (advance reservation is appreciated).

We also will hand our \u201cessential information sheet\u201d to all guests so that they can bring it over and show the taxi driver where we are located (as some taxi drivers are also new to Bali).\r\n\r\nWe are delighted to inform all tripadvisor members/readers that as of October 2013 THE JINENG VILLAS is managed by KARANIYA EXPERIENCE, a hospitality management company that present most sought-after boutique villas, spa and restaurants. \r\n\r\nOnce again thank you very much for your review.

I've been a regular traveller to bali for many years however normally staying in hotels rather then villas.\nGreat villa for couples. Very private and the private pools in the villas are amazing. The size of it was great! \nStaff are all very friendly and welcoming. Always going out of there way to help us and provide local transport free of charge to local shops and restaurants. \nIt seemed some of the villas were undergoing some upgrades while we were there so I'm sure the villas will be even better next time we go because we will be back again for sure.",

Overall i would have to say the accommodation and level of service from lower level staff have been superb and super hands on.\nThe complex itself gives a very new vibe and i would say that i would definitely come back with only some minor hold backs.\nThe location itself is decent. It is right next to the main strip though it is advised that if you are into buying cheap and replica items then your at prime location. Having said that it isnt exactly walking distance if you are not use to the heat.\nThe staff are super attentive and do definitely feel like royalty with their above and beyond attitude. That cant be said the same for the higher manager. During my tenure I would call her the smiling wolf. Almost all staff here give you the perception of honesty but I felt her desire to up sell for additional revenue rubbed me the wrong way. i.e. It was clear to me getting from point x to point y may only take 20 mins, but to test waters Id ask once again and though a staff was about to confirm I was correct, a nudge and talk over to say it took double the time. Another incident would be the hiring of the hotel car only needing 5 hours she would try sell me 8 AFTER being told by the actual driver it costs 100k less. That aside i do stand patient if there are misunderstanding with general staff as english is not their mother tongue. \nAs for amenities, personal preference would be body wash over soup. The shower head does lack abit of water pressure and hot water does take a while. In terms of breakfast or other food orders, it is operated by a cafe near by. My stay came from discount vouchers therefore breakfast was free, so i guess you pay for what you get so dont expect too much. Paid component is of value but dont expect it to be Michelin quality.\nCant say enough about how great the staff less manager is...pool is fantastic..taxis can be unsure where you stay so make sure you have net access to guide them...\nwill be hitting up the massages in the next few days..so maybe more to come..but hope for a strong finish!\n\nThats my 2 cents thus far^^",

They just need a fresh coat of paint, and a little bit of love the new management were painting the office & entrance during our stay so im sure that the villas will be given some love as well. \nas for the spa/ jacuzzi in our villa it would have taken 5 days to fill as all bali goers would know the water pressure is not the best. for some this may be an issue but you have the pool for swimming why would you fill up a bath tub? \nThe beds are devine our king size bed swallowed us whole & even the single bed provided as an optional extra for our daughter was above & beyond a normal bed. \nvilla was always clean, linen clean & the bath & pool towels replaced every morning where fluffy & smelt lovely. \nonly one thing i would higly suggest for the new management company is to provide room service to the villas as Breakfast is the only meal they supply. \nI just feel you need to have the option on those days you want to laze around the pool to call room service for a burger or a light snack & a few cocktails..it doesnt have to be a big menu but having that option for me would tick all the boxes. \n\nAs for those whom complained about bugs just get some mozi coils & burn them at dusk if you are swiimming & you can also contact Baby Bali hire theyll also deliver mozi repelant to your villa this is a great option for those with sensative skin as its all natural. \n\nwe will be returning to the Jineng Villas again.",

              "text": "What we loved about it is the villas' style and atmosphere. The design was very modern while the furnishings still give the villa a traditional touch. Once you enter the gate to your private villa, you are welcomed by the pool to your right, which was especially nice at night. The entertainment/living/dining room to the left is very spacious. The bedroom/toilet at the far end was very roomy and comfortable. The toilet, especially the bathtub, was huge and clean. And yes, some of the reviews are correct in saying that the toilet gives a weird smell, especially during the first day. But somehow, you get used to it, so it gets lost after a few hours. Just make sure you bring insect repellents. For some reason, we got lots of insect bites (not sure though if they were from the hotel or from outside). The location is far enough from the busy strip near Kuta beach, but near enough for a nice 15-30min stroll. The long walk from the reception to your villa is refreshing in the morning but rather stressful after a long day. \n\nStaff were friendly, generally. But probably due to the language difference, they couldn't seem to understand what we wanted. Breakfast took almost an hour late. We asked for power adaptors, but for some reason, they gave us writing pens. The massage time, thus the cost, was doubled. Asking for directions was such a hassle, we just had to rely on Google Maps. \n\nBooked this hotel from a dealsite, so we got a discount and a lot of perks. Really really good deal. But seeing the original prices in the website, it's rather expensive than what I would have paid for without the deal.",

The check in was fine took few minutes and we were escorted to the room. On first glance you think this looks good, private pool and all. But as soon you walk round the rooms you think when was the last time this place was properly cleaned?! The toilets were probably the biggest put off they had stains an dirt all around, disgusting! The floors were Really dusty. The breakfast is mediocre to put it nicely. We asked for an iron and they told us they only have one and is currently in another room, we'll try bring you one tomorrow. The staff couldnt care less. We asked reception to change some money to smaller bills for a taxi and they said they don't keep money there. We ordered breakfast at 9 everyday and they kept calling us at 0730am telling us breakfast was there. Towels were not consistent and they were worn out and with huge stains. The lights in pool weren't working. The showers do not get proper hot water and the bathtub was so dirty we did not dare set foot in it. Were do I finish? The location is not excellent though we didn't mind it. We have to give it to one of the staff called AGU hes a real sweetheart. The rest of the staff are indifferent and dont speak proper english. The front of the hotel looks like a dump site. Not worth the money. The place does have potential but is in dire need of new managment and staff. Total Rip off. We have travelled through Asia extensively, we are used to geckos and mosquitos, taking into consideration we travel for work. But this is complete waste of money, do look elsewhere.",

              "text": "Bought a Groupon for a 3D2N stay at Nunia Boutique villa but could not get a room during our stipulated dates and the management was kind enough to let us stay at Jineng Villa (comparable and also at Seminyak area) instead of wasting the groupon. \n\nI really love Jineng Villa. The place is clean and private! All their staffs are very friendly. I requested to drive the buggy car one noon and their staff remembered and allowed me to drive subsequently!  I enjoyed the experience as I don't get to drive that in Singapore! Unless my job requires me to. Hahaha... anyway their breakfast is simple but nice and has quite a variety to choose from. The pool is clean but sun is not shining the whole pool. Good for me who doesn't wish to get too tanned but bad for my friend who wants to get herself burnt. As such, our bikinis and towel can't dry even after a day. \n\nThe connection was really bad at our room (room N). My conclusion is it's too far from the office as its the 2nd last room. Unless you really can't live without internet (facebook, instagram etc), it's not too big of an issue. I mean, you go there to chill and relax with you family, lover or friends, you don't have to stick to your phone that frequently. \n\nLocation of the villa is not very fantastic but they do provide complimentary airport transfer and shuttle service to the beach and some shopping area so I have no complaints. Even if you want to walk out to the main road, it's only about a 10-15 minute walk. You just need to turn right from the villa and walk all the way straight. There is a minimart if you turn right again when you reach the main road, else you can also buy from the locals' minimart which is just 5 minute walk from the villa. Finding food is not that difficult too.\n\ndining area is very stuffy, guess the air conditioning wasnt functioning well but it doesnt really matter to us as we are only there for breakfast. The other times were spent chilling or having meals by our private pool. The fridge there works well. There are stoves but no pots and pans, in case you want to cook something. \n\nMany mosquitoes but there is something called insect repellent so it doesn't matter. You want the trees and plants to add on to the privacy feel, you bear with it. \n\nWill come back again if my budget allows!",

              "text": "My wife and I did a fair bit of research before deciding on The Jineng. Everyone advised us to stay in Seminyak and not stay in Kuta. We are both in our 50s and wanted a private villa with our own pool and also the budgets for such a place do vary quite a bit - we paid approximately $150 a night - you can pay a lot more if you wish.\nWe arrive at the airport and were promptly met by our driver who was holding our names up on a board and driven to the villas. There we were greeted by the staff who immediately offered us some \"orange juice\" which tasted strangely like cordial - I had one sip and reminded myself of Bali Belly and declined to drink the rest.\nWe sorted out the usual formalities of paper work etc and were driven by the Golf Buggy up to our villa - a whole 100 metres away ha ha. We opened the gate and it really was like it appears in the photos on here. It was extremely pleasant. The first room on our right was lovely, clean and quite large - considering we would only really use it for breakfast etc but it also had a toilet and shower. The fridge wasn't a small bar fridge - a full size fridge which was quite pleasing really. There were drinks in the fridge but you had to pay for them. Then they showed us the bedroom/bathroom with a spa. This room again was quite large with plenty of cupboard and wardrobe space. 2 tvs, one in each room but no  DVD player - which I found a little odd. As we were unpacking one of the staff came back with 3 bintangs (hot) - these were our complimentary arrival drinks (I'm sure it said 6 - perhaps I misread this).\nThe location is probably a 5 minute walk to the main street that goes from Kuta to Seminyak and another 10 minute walk to the beach - winding through all the shops etc. I quite enjoy walking so I found it quite pleasing actually. However if you wish to as we found out after about 4 days you can take the shuttle to the beach and the Jineng has its own sunbeds on the beach - no charge - There is a guy there who looks after them and he was very helpful and quite pleasant - if you use this service it will save you about $10 a day. We used to lay there on the chairs - leave our things behind and go off and have lunch at one of the restaurants and nothing was taken while we were away.\nAll in all I would say The Jineng was quite good - the only issue we had was the smell from the toilet but you get around that. Also the mozzies but again - take some coils light them at sunset and you won't be bothered. Breakfast was quite adequate I couldn't understand some of the fuss by the comments on here about breakfast - if what they gave you didn't fill you up - you must be a big eater I guess. Would I go back? - No but then I rarely go back to the same place - I like trying different hotels/countries etc. Overall it was a good holiday and we enjoyed it quite much.",

She helped arranged our complimentary airport pickup, provide plenty of useful information for first-time visitors, etc. Location was quiet and going anywhere will require a cab. The not-so-good-quality of the furnishings are getting obvious and showing their age. Water pressure from certain taps are weak. Some stains are obvious. Biggest bug of them all will be the below-average standard from their housekeeping department, but they are really observant to our drinking needs and provide plenty of bottled water everyday. Thumbs up to that!",

              "text": "We stayed at Jineng Villas in a 1  bedroom for 11 nights. The staff very attentive and professional. We were met at the airport as arranged, and given 3 cold Bintangs. The Villa was certainly up to scratch, with lovely bedroom,with lots of drawers and cupboard space. the separate living dining was well appointed with a full size fridge and kitchenette. No cooking utensils in site but we did not really want any anyway. Maybe some people arrange for a private chef. This large room also had another toilet, shower and basin in a small closed area at the end. If you were entertaining  guests would not have to trapse through your bedroom. the bathroom was modern and looked fabulous with a spa. The pool was about 7 meters long, and was sparkling clean. We had 2 sun lounges. This area was shaded by a porch. The villas had a huge Gate/door leading out to the private paved alley that was shaded with bamboo curving over to form a canopy. This lead up to the main office.\nLoved the stay not much to fault.\n Only downpoints were the smell of the drains were apparent in the bathroom. The staff did seem to leave the exhaust fans on when they serviced the rooms and the smell then dissipated a bit.\nThe breakfast included were brought to our villa  with a choice of 3 time slots decided the day prior. There was a bit of choice mainly eggs whichever way of nasi goreng & fruit, juices. If we ordered eggs also got a small basket with barely toasted  slices of bread and croissants with butters and various jams.\nThey were brought in on a huge tray and the staff set up the table etc which was great. The orange juice tasted like cordial so we bought our own long life version at supermarket.\nwe also took our own T-bags and bought long life milk.\nLoved the Jineng but it is a 15 min walk to the beach.  Mardi was happy to drive us, A shuttle service is available to and from beach and local supermarket daily. We walked a lot and the staff will arrange taxis at night if required. We found the bluebird taxis less dodgey as they all have a metre.\nMozzies are a bit of an issue. We burnt mozzie coils out dusk, and always put on repellant before we went outside in the evening.\nThe free Wi-fi was good lost service twice but staff promptly recified the problem.\nThe rooms were serviced daily, fresh towels daily but not linen.\nWe thought they had forgotten about the free massage, but on about day 3 they mentioned it and the next morning 2 ladies came to our room at the time we booked and we both got a half hour foot massage.\nWe booked our accom on a special through the internet for $150 per night. Was pretty good value however would not have paid the supposed full price that was double.",

              "text": "This is our first trip to Bali for my birthday. The place is nice and pretty. Quiet. You can enjoy the private time there with your love ones. It's clean and the pool is big enough. I don't find mosquitoes or bugs (Lucky us :P) Staffs are polite and attentive. They will clean our room and on the air-con and lights for us. So everyday when we back to villa, it feels like home. Since I saw others comment about the safety box, so we are not leaving any valuable things at the villa. \n\nBut if you really want to stay there, I have a few tips for you.\n\n1. The location is far from main street so it's not convenient for food or shopping. And if you want to ask them to arrange the transport for you, you must mention to them you need Blue Bird taxi else they will call the community taxi for you (you can see them outside the villa) and they will charge you whatever they want (it's scary expensive)\n2. The breakfast is ok but not much variety and the portion is quite small for a guy. They will order the food for you if you want. We tried once and it's not nice.\n3. We have arranged the poolside dinner for my birthday. The dinner is not nice. Not worth for the price. You can get better dinner outside there. \n\nOverall, it was an ok staying but not fantastic as we expected. People are nice there but I think they need to be more organized and improve their food. It's quite wasted because it's really a beautiful and quiet place for relax and leisure trip.",

              "text": "Well,it was my first trip to Bali. We went to Jineng on our honeymoon for 7days, 10th March to 17th March. Flight was evening flight reached villa abt 1900hrs on first day, checkin at Jineng villa, staff was very polite and helpful.Recived welcoming juice also, villa located in a very quiet area not noisy just 5mins walk to main street of seminyak. Our one bedroom villa was awesome, very clean and tidy the swimming pool Too!! Made us smile the moment we stepped onto the villa. Settle down went out to the streets of seminyak, did a little bit of shopping and its always a must to rent a bike be it bali or phuket! So went back villa with a scrambler, the bike was our transport that took us around during our weeks stay riding around the amazing streets and beaches of Bali. \n\nThe boring part was the honeymoon clashes with Bali nyepi day, that we cant actually go out for a day. But we manage to kill the boredom, movie marathon with room service and food and pool fun Haa! \nSo a day of stay home thingy was pretty bored actually coz u cant go out at all, Tv channel was off too! \n(Wont go to bali on nyepi again.) \n\nFor breakfast was good, they sent it to the room every morning just pick the available time they have and u when wanted,  you get to choose different food, juices everyday. The mee goreng and nasi goreng was pretty good! Thumbs up. Ordered room service food too was nice! Always love indonesian food. :) services frm the villa staff is good, very polite.\nAnd also, we were caught in the heavy rain right when we went riding on last minute shopping before our trip to airport cause ours is a midnight flight on Qatar airways back home, came back to villa to get our bags, and the staff offered us a shower room too to dryed up ! Cool,  i think this practice in every hotel anywhere is good service. Keep it up! \n \nThe days spend in Bali was amazing, went to seminyak & kuta streets and beaches, ku de ta restaurant for night dining, uluwatu, jinbaran beach for seafood many more i have forgotten. Haa! \nAnd also our one day tour guide \"hendrix\" that brought us around, on our last day. He was great!! \n\nAnd so a honeymoon well spend! \nThe Jineng villa was like our home for that week, and im beginning to miss the villa already.We thanked all the staff that provided us their good service thruout our stay. \nWe shall definitely come back to Bali and will definitely book The Jineng Villas again. Im looking forward for my next trip to Bali again. Sooon? I guess. :) \nThumbs Up!",

Breakfast was not filling at all and it is suppose to be chief cooking in your villa, however, I have never seen some one come to cook. Always have some people bring your cold meal to your place.\nStaffs were unprofessional. Always has staffs set out side the villa talk with random people on the street. The whole place just looks like doggy!\nWe keep money in the safe and got lost for a quite huge amount. I believe it is not just me, at least happened couple times before according to tripadvistor other travelers review. I wish I had a chance read the review before I booked with this Villa. Unfortunately, I booked with other website which does not have review for the customer.Over all, it is very disappointed stay!",

Our villa was cleaned daily although the sheets were not changed daily since they were clean. This was not an issue for us since there was absolutely no need to chAnge sheets daily when they were clean just because we paid a daily rate for the room. Breakfast tho nothing much to shout about was generally acceptable and in line with expectations. Other services such as the Tv , Ac , Internet,jacuzzi , hot water in shower , operation of the indoor pool were all excellent.my daughter had such a wonderful time connecting to the Internet that she refuses to follow us out anywhere. My wife and I had difficulty connecting to the Internet because we were not IT savy like her . I assume many other travellers like my wife and I could experience the same problem because of their similar lack of IT knowledGe  unlike my daughter. This could lead them to the conclusion that the wifi services are down when they actually do not know how to make full use of the services . We did leave valuables in the room although not in the safe and nothing was removed although they were arranged neatly on our return. FInally  we would like to thank Mr Budi and his team of staff for having made our stay enjoyable and pleasant with their caring attitude and friendly advise whenever consulted. We wish them well and will definitely visit the Jineng again and hope to see them there. With kind regards . Simon and Sarah.",

              "text": "Location: Exit being onto a back lane street evidently leads to 10 minute walk to reach any major road so taxi is only option here. Not to blame villa here, probably personal bad choice in locale.\n\nVilla was clean and modern to say however still evidence of construction residue on most surfaces outside, inside was spotless in living areas. Toilets not so much.\nBeds were comfortable unfortunately linen was not of the clean sort. Various stains and our blanket had what appeared to be a shoe tread marks. Linen not changed in 5 days there.\n\nMosquitoes were addressed it seams this time with the smellifier thing however lack of any adapter point for people visiting from places other then Indonesia was a problem. Trying to charge 3 phones and a laptop via single converter is not convenient in any way\n\nBreakfast, as other have mentioned, was absolutely horrible. I don't know if you can call that a breakfast. Always arrive almost cold or cold. Seeing catering cars out front imagine it was made somewhere far way.\n\nWifi was down every day, having to repeatedly ask for it to be fixed during entire 5 days at least 2-3 times a day. Out of regular reception stuff of probably 4 different people one spoke English rest were just repeating what you said to them - explaining that wifi was down was problematic to the point where they just repeat exactly what you said and tell you to enter your password to fix it.\n\nHere comes the disaster - this was a family holiday where we have arrived with wife from Australia and her parents from China bringing AUD$10,000 as present for wedding in cash. This was counted and locked up in a room safe. We have taken out the cash on the second last day however did not recount it and have consequently left to Australia. Upon arrival and visiting a bank for deposit only $7900 remained. $2100 was lifted from safe during only a few days stay. \nWord of advise is to not store anything of value in safe, jewelry or cash. Have card for your spend if you intend to stay there and having read other review (kicking self for not doing so prior) this is common occurrence.\n\nA decent villa ruined by theft and absence of service. While rooms were kept clean and us tipping generously regularly, the theft is the lowest thing you can expect.",

                     "text": "Dear our Lovely Client \r\n\r\nWarm greeting from The Jineng Villas by Premier Hospitality Asia , \r\n\r\nThank you so much for your kind feedback that is much valuable for our further improvement. After reading your review and investigating it toward our perspective, we are about to give our professional comment to put all the thing in its right place.\r\n\r\nHere below is our Villa Manager report to our department:\r\n\r\nRegarding Linen and Towels , our staff always change the Linen such as : sheets and blankets every 2 days during the guest staying. But they changed right way if the linens are dirty. Towels has been changed every day, yet for towels condition we transparently reveal that it is yes our towels are not as bright as what people see as bright white. We thank you so much to call us regarding this,hence we attempt to purchase new ones\r\n\r\nMosquitoes issue is actually our main problem due to tropical area, but we have regularly scheduled Terminix Pest control twice a months. And every turn down services, our staff always spray the mosquito sprayer in the room.\r\n\r\nThe Jineng sets up the electric converter at every villas, and has some spares at the office. If it does not work, the guest must call our front officer to change and report the case immediately. Our team will be very much glad to assist.\r\n\r\nRegarding the standard of Breakfast, The Jineng has been ordering and purchasing several supporting equipment and valuing the portion of the breakfast itself since we are now hiring a new F&B product manager\r\n\r\nWIFI, Internet connection is sometimes down at the Jineng, but our team never keeps it off , they always restart the modem and it works again ever since.Although it's a big crash on internet, we would be trying to resolve it immediately\r\n\r\nFor safety box, here is i quote what our manager stated regarding :\r\n\"I really surprised for this sensitive issue. If they lost their money at safety box during their staying, why they did not report to us immediately. So we can investigate at that time. your comment says: \u201cWe have taken out the cash on the second last day however DID NOT RECOUNT IT and consequently left to Australia.\r\nWhat I catch from this statement is:  they took the money but never count it and never know how much they took.  And only the guest knows their locked combination. I have the Master key for the Safety box, but I always come to reopen whenever the guest call us if they have problems with the safety box. I never come to their Villa during their staying.\"\r\n\r\nHope the money matter is not our staff fault since ever we have provided the safety box for keeping all the guests' personal belonging inside it and keeping it locked. Nobody knows about the code combination, except the guest. Also such kind of cases should be solved on the site not after a guest arriving at their country, since we never know what has happened after the guest leaving the villa . Thus we could not proceed it into crime claim. \r\n\r\nOverall, we are highly appreciating your kind comment and it could help us to make a better improvement for future service \r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to contact us should you require more assistance. We would be more than glad to assist\r\n\r\nMany thanks and regards\r\n\r\nLismana",

              "text": "After weeks of researching various villas around the deminyak area, i decided to go with the Jineng. It was good value for money and looked to be within a good area. To start off with the villas were clean which was a positive... but I must say up until this hotel I didnt believe in bad customer service. The reception area is a local hangout to be honest, 6 or 7 local boys sitting in there speaking indonesian and talking about you clearly and laughing. This place is not like a fully functional hotel which is up and running. It seemed as if it was partially running, but definitly didnt live up to expectation. The villa itself was nice, although lacked atmosphere. Unless the sun is shining into the pool, which was for max 2 hours per day..it had a really dull feeling to it, and felt like a compound. \nThe breakfast was shocking.. not after being a regular traveller to Bali 13 timest to be exact, you come to appreciate a good breakfast in bali. This was so dissapointing considering they sell the villa saying that the chef will come in and personally cook (which is not true)... 1 rasher or bacon, 1 egg, and around 3 peices of pineapple and a fruit juice which is one gulp. Not nearly enough considering I usually find breakfast is my main meal of the day until dinner in the heat. I believe we were the only people saying in the whole hotel, consisting of 17 villas. As we would walk past other villas we could see locals in lying on the beds watching television which was quite the turn off. I would hate to think that the rooms are just open to anyone if they are not being occupied. To be honest Jineng was a major dissapointment and for the cost you could find something much better in Bali. I believe if you want the tranquility of a private villa pay the extra and get a good one - usually affiliated with the big hotels because then they offer all options like larger swimming pools, and good breakfasts,,\n\nAlso I was put off by someone elses review about missing money from the safe.. I wouldnt put it past them at this place, it just felt very seedy..",

Though they dunt have a park that we can hang up a round but they have a nice broadwalk. Though they dunt have restaurant, but we can order food and it is served infront of your doorstep. \n\nOne thing i need to highlight is that there are plenty of mosquitoes at night, so please bring mosquito repeller, and make sure your doors and windows are close at night to minimize mosquito bite. Overall we are happy staying in the villa and we will recommend it to our friends.",

It cost us IDR 2.500.000,- for a two night stay, one bedroom villa, honeymoon room set up, romantic dinner, jet lag massage, airport transfer. We find overall the hotel was good for value.\n- At first, at the entrance during checking in, we find it disturbing looking at some staffs in a see through glass staff room were playing bridge games. It was very impolite and inappropriate.\n- The room and pool are in a good size, suitable for 2, with living room, spacious bathroom, with extra pool bathroom, kitchen and dining.\n- Reading review regarding the complain on the bugs and mosquitoes, we found some mosquitoes, but not a big deal.\n- They also provide car / motorcycle service. Motorcycle service at very reasonable price, IDR 50.000,- / day, which is cheaper than others.\n- They also provide in room massage service, we got jet lag massage as compliment, it was a very nice 30 mins relaxing massage.\n- The breakfast was good, we had two days of american style breakfast. The check out day was early in the morning, we asked for early breakfast, they're supposed to serve breakfast starting 7. But they serve it to us at 6 anyway, which was great and highly appreciated!",

The staff at The Jineng were very good especially the young girl on the front desk.\n  We were upgraded to a two bedroom apartment which was nice as it had a massive family style pool.\n  The rooms are a good size and the beds are very comfortable\n  As for the mosquitos issue in other reviews there were a few but it was not a major issue.\n   The breakfast was nice we had both the Nasi and Mee Gorang with nice fresh fruit and juice.\n   The location is about a 10 minute walk to the main street and a 4km walk or taxi ride to Kuta.\n   Overall a very nice stay at The Jineng.",

              "text": "I had a great time at the jineng with its accommodation and charming staffs which could fulfil my request. Small private villa which you might need to pay more if you stay at a 5 star boutique resort but here you can have it all. Great accommodation and private swimming pool with a very strategic location in semi yak and easy for us to go out and reach all places that we wants to go. Breakfast was good but might need some variance for long staying guests, great price offered and the reservation staff of premier Nisa is an asset! talentted young lady with her will to help and assist during the reservation. Booking confirmation well recieved with all details and arrangement. She has also try to assist us with every arrangement we need. We such a great time at the jineng and wish to come back again soon..... \n\nQuite and nice place for accommodation especially in seminal area which sometimes are very crowded everywhere. One thing almost forgot is the beach club, very nice and we could have our sun bathing ......\n\nAlso the manager, pak arya if I am not mistaken is very helpful in all they way ..Thanks to all the staff and we will spread out this also to our colleague and friends about jineng..",

              "text": "We were only in Bali for the weekend. \n\nWe arrived Thursday night around midnight and left on the following Sunday. \n\nI had a some of the reveiews below as was a little aprehensive to book here but i always believe some people have too high expectations about Bali accomodation. \n\nThe pool was a great size for a 1 bed villa with a ledge spanning the entire length which is great if you have kids (our daughter was 9 months when we went last weekend). She couldnt stand on her own but could stand when she was in her swim ring. \n\nThe ability to have the lounge room door closed was fantastic for us. Most Bali villas have an open plan lounge room which means it is hot and you have to be extra viligient watching you kids as there is no fence around the pool. We were abke to close the glass doors and let our daughter frawl around the lounge without having to worry about her going near the pool. \n\nThe bedroom was fantastic!! Huge king size bed, massive bathroom with wet area with the shower and toilet, massive spa bath plus here was also a seperate toilet and shower between the bedroom and the lounge area. \n\nThey have a huge fridge but no microwave yet but were happy for us to use the staff microwave to heat up our baby food which we bought up fresh from Perth. \n\nThe breakfast was ok but we only had it 1 day. There are plenty of cafes in Bali to have breakfast and we like to get up in the morning and go out. It wouldnt bother me if they didn't even do breakfast. \n\nI never keep any money in the safe or cupboards anyway. We usually take some cash and spend the st in our credit card/visa debit cards. Everywhere takes credit cards even DvD shops plus you get the benefit of getting a better rate through the bank. \n\nThe location is off Jalan Nakula if you tell your taxi driver the villas are off this street just past villa seminyak estate and spa and just before villa kubu. \n\nYou could walk to the main jalan legian street with the street coming out just north of bintang supermarket. I loved the fact that the villas were so quiet and we never heard any cars or motobikes (not like our last stay near eat street in seminyak!). \n\nThere is also some taxi's that are about 20 metres from the front of the villa so you dont even need to worry about calling a taxi. \n\nI thought the villa was clean, staff friendly and accomodating. \n\nSpecial thanks to the staff as we left my husbands wallet as the villa and got a phone call when we were just getting to the villa. The security man got on his scooter and brought the wallet to us at the airport. \n\nI would recommend anyone to stay at the villa and hope to be back next year.",

              "text": "The Villa itself is beautiful. Large and clean on arrival and the airport pick up was very handy. The staff were initially very welcoming and let us check in early. Although, from there it was all downhill.\n\n-The breakfast was AWFUL!! We had it on the first day, the bread was stale, the eggs and bacon cold and the fruit bitter. The juice was warm and there was no milk for tea/coffee. \n\n-Having had such an awful breakfast we informed the reception we no longer wanted their breakfast (TWICE!) and they still called us at 11.30pm and woke us up to inform us we hadnt yet placed our breakfast order for the next morning so I had to tell them AGAIN we didnt want their breakfast. They then rang our doorbell in the morning and woke us up again to deliver a breakfast we had not ordered. \n\n-On our third day there I went to retrieve our extra cash from the safe only to find nearly half of it had been stolen. I reported this to management who informed me that all staff have access to keys to open the in room safes. They took us to the police station to lodge a police report (this took half the afternoon!) \n\n-After the stolen money incident I told them no housekeeping or any other staff were to enter the room while we were not there and so we had to have housekeeping pottering around while we were trying to relax and on several occassions house keeping failed to leave us clean towels (as they were at maximum capacity and had run out!), failed to replace our water bottles and failed to properly make the bed or empty the bins. Very disappointing. \n\nThe villas arent very close to anything although taxis are very cheap so that wasnt a massive problem but still a nuisance. Overall, although the villas themselves are gorgeous the overall experience was utterly disappointing.",

              "text": "The bottom line: They should call this place the 'Dodgy'-neng!\n\nIn more detail:\nWe stayed there for 6.5 nights in June 2012, before our stay we were very concerned about some negative reviews on Trip Advisor and on Booking.com so we emailed the Villas. They did quickly reply ensuring us that everything in the reviews was not true (but in a follow up email failed to respond when asked what assurances they can provide if they weren\u2019t). We also asked and receive an email confirming our additional half day with late check out (9pm) at half a day\u2019s rate as we had a red eye flight home, all before arriving. \n\nThe positives:\n\nRooms are as they are in the photos but...\nStaff are friendly and mean well but...\n\nSo the negatives:\n\n- Confirming other reviews; the water, shower area, bath, and toilet smell like a sewer. Every so often the smell really seems to intensify making you gag and want to vomit. This makes simple daily tasks like showering or brushing your teeth really unenjoyable and really dampens/ruins your holiday experience.\n\n- Confirming other reviews; the location isn\u2019t too great. Luckily we had arranged daily transport (not with the hotel) but without it I think you and any taxi driver would have found it hard to find. E.g. we ordered MacDonald\u2019s delivery one night, the nearest MacD. Is only 3-5 minutes ride away and the local delivery guy took 1 hour to find the place.\n\n- When we arrived the room safe was not functioning so they asked if we would like to move to another villa, which we agreed to\n\n- Moving to the replacement villa we noticed that there where stains on the pillow sheets, questioning the staff member who escorted us to our room, he looked at it and just said laundry have tried clean it but couldn\u2019t and didn\u2019t bother offering to change it. \n\n- Saying that the villas are new, we had to ask for the keys to the sliding door which controls access to the bedroom (separate from the villa key)\n\n- That night we found a dead bug between the other pillows, called and got new pillow cases \n\n- There were also some stains on the bed sheets\n\n- There is still construction work happening on the first 3 villas at the front of the property which you have to pass by everyday, needless to say there is noise and stairs from the construction workers every time you walk past\n \n- Although the rooms are as they are in the pictures you can tell that an inexperience designer and builder did them. There are lamps that don\u2019t work cause they have no where to plug into which is the same with the kettle (which we had to plug in next to the TV). The place really is form before function.\n\n- The staff although very friendly, mean well and try to help are really not well trained and are inexperienced. E.g. We asked for a bottle opener (as they are not provided) as was told they ran out, next day asked again and was given one. \n\n- Mosquitoes come with the climate in that part of the world but having stayed in other hotels and Villas in SE Asia before I noticed more than usual, perhaps due to the water issue. Luckily we bought a can of spray and sprayed our room daily, otherwise we would have woken up with bites all over.\n\n- The breakfast; you have to select what you want the night before and the breakfast gets delivered to your room at a time of your choosing which I thought was nice. Additionally we get to choose what juice and fruit you want and if you want an Indonesian breakfast (rice or noodles) or an continental breakfast. The Indonesian breakfast is fair but when I ordered the bacon and eggs all I got was 1 strip of bacon (yes just 1) and one egg. \n\n- On our second last day despite the prior confirmation of a 9pm checkout, at noon when dropping off my keys so they can clean the Villa staff using the excuse of traffic asked if we could leave earlier\u2026unbelievable! Especially as they knew that my wife is currently pregnant and our flight was a red eye, I simply said we will see and didn\u2019t think much of it. Then that night when picking up my room key they asked if it was possible and I said that I had internet checked in already so 9pm would work, after telling them this\u2026 they asked again! This was the very last straw and really pissed me off and frankly has triggered me to write this complete review. \n\n- On our last day around 4 hours prior to checkout the cable TV (and thus all channels) stopped working. (not sure if this was related to them wanting to get us out early)\n\nIn summary, although we were having a fair experience the issues noted above really spoilt our holiday. Even after having secured promotional rates (the main reason we chose The Jineng) I (obviously) wouldn\u2019t recommend you to stay here. There is a myriad of choices and villas competing for your business that I\u2019m sure with research you can find a pool villa miles better than this.",

This is to be a beneficial input for our better future\r\n\r\nAs being investigated, we got several wisdom in this matter and would be very happy to view this matter as a wise and relative condition, in a chronological way \r\n\r\nThe condition was right that we had a trouble in safety box in the villa M where the client would be checking in. It is a technical problem that could happen and be fixed. Realizing that we had back to back client, we were happy to accommodate client to Villa H, surely by the agreement of the client themselves. Before moving, the client were asked to inspect the villa unit H, and client agreed. Nothing wrong with it \r\n\r\nAbout the spot, it was a spot that we could only see by using microscope. Normal eye even could not see it as spot. Of course, we would be considering such thing for future act. Thank you so much. And client did no comment at the time being, as we assumed that there was no problem at all. \r\n\r\nA subjective and relative comment toward our room smell was understandable. However, different person has different fragrance sensitivity \r\n\r\nRe the breakfast, we are sure we are not that bad, we provided at the standard portion\r\n\r\nStaff asked for 30 minutes earlier drop-off time , just for the sake of the clients' comfort since they were worry if client got late to the airport.  Saturday is terribly traffic jam \r\n\r\nWe could review that our staff has attempted to do their best \r\nAgain , thank you so much for this kind input , we would be taking them into account for our improvement \r\n\r\nThank you and regards\r\n\r\nLismana",

              "text": "We have just returned from 10 days staying at the Jineng Villas and it was great. It is located between the main roads of Sunset and Seminyak, just 10min walk to the main Seminyak shopping street and with a taxi rank out the front of the hotel - you could get anywhere. The staff could not do enough for us and loved our two young boys. They have a golf cart to deliver baggage, breakfast, etc and they were always taking the kids for a drive and the boys loved it. The breakfasts were good - generous helpings and a good range of food on offer. The also had a book of different delivery options for lunch and dinner from local restaurants if you didn't want to head out.\n\nWe stayed in the two bedroom villa and the rooms were modern and very spacious. The pool was clean and caught enough sun to keep the water lovely and warm but allowed you to also swim in the shade if you wanted. If I am to be critical of the design of the 2-bed villa (and we did have an afternoon in a 1-bed villa while we waited for our flight and it didn't have this issue) was the partial open air design of the bathroom. We were lucky during our stay that there was no rain but I can imagine that during hot wet summers the mosquitos would be a serious issue. My suggestion - get yourself down to the Bintang Supermarket for some flyspray.\n\nOverall we have a great time in Seminyak and the staff made us feel very much at home.",

We do apologize for lateness in replying since we are just alive on tripadvisor., so only by today we could respond on this review \r\n\r\nRegarding all things you've mentioned, we just would like to clarify that we took over this villa from the beginning of April and doing a really huge renovation on them. If you stayed before or amongst the dates of April, when we did our re-construction, it was fair enough to have such comment. \r\n\r\nHowever, by now, we have been well maintained the surrounding as well as the property. The staffs has been renewed and the new ones have been continuously trained. Room directory has been updated and developed. thus, breakfast is now various by its own menu. This is closed to Seminyak and not too far so not too near if you would like to go to Seminyak  Beaches\r\n\r\nAlso, we are now having the exclusive beach club in Seminyak where clients could freely accessing the  beach club. Free shuttle service must be also available based on the  schedule. \r\n\r\nHowever, to become better does need time , along the way there is error found. Thus, when you come back to our property, it must be lovely to serve you best and we are very welcome for your generous comment \r\n\r\nYour kind attention is highly appreciated\r\n\r\nAgain, we do thank you so much for your kind review \r\n\r\nMany thanks and regards\r\nLismana",

              "text": "Wir verbrachten hier die ersten 12 Tage unserer Bali-Reise in einer 2-Schlafzimmer Villa und waren wirklich begeistert. Die Villa war sehr sch\u00f6n eingerichtet und sehr sauber. Handt\u00fccher und Bettw\u00e4sche wurden t\u00e4glich gewechselt. Zum Einzug gab es eine Schale mit exotischen Fr\u00fcchten und im K\u00fchlschrank standen kostenlose Getr\u00e4nke bereit. Selbst in den B\u00e4dern stand jeden Tag eine Flasche Mineralwasser/ pro Person zum Z\u00e4hneputzen bereit. \u00dcberhaupt war an viele nette Details gedacht, die einen Urlaub wirklich angenehm machen. Sogar am Abend kam das Personal noch einmal um M\u00fcckenspray (auf Wunsch) zu verteilen.\nDas Fr\u00fchst\u00fccksangebot war sehr gut und wurde zur gew\u00fcnschten Uhrzeit p\u00fcnktlich in der Villa serviert. Besonders hervorheben m\u00f6chte ich hier die leckeren frischen S\u00e4fte. Aber auch das Abendessen war sehr gut.\nEinziger Nachteil war die Lage. Man musste \u00fcber eine vielbefahrene Stra\u00dfe zum Strand. Das wurde jedoch durch den kostenlosen Shuttleservice, der jederzeit zur Verf\u00fcgung stand, wieder wettgemacht. Die Fahrer brachten uns zu jedem gew\u00fcnschten Ziel in der n\u00e4heren Umgebung. Abschlie\u00dfend muss noch die unglaubliche Freundlichkeit und der excellente Service des Personals erw\u00e4hnt werden, das den Aufenthalt dort zu einem unvergesslichen Erlebnis macht!",
