              "text": "Awal kami tiba di pantai kami kira sangat menyenangkan melihat pantai yg putih bersih pas depan Scallywag, ternyata itu restorannya, villanya harus kami tempuh dengan berjalan kaki sekitar 15 menit masuk ke dalam permukiman rumah penduduk. Karna kami banyak anak kecil sehingga ketika tiba di villa kita tidak mau keluar lagi mengingat jauhnya perjalanan dan hari sudah sore. Mereka memberikan free 4 unit sepeda tapi karna byk anak kecil tdk bisa kami keluar semua. Akhirnya menghabiskan waktu di villa dengan berenang. Malam kesulitan mencari makan, untung tidak jauh kami menemukan penjual pecel ayam, lumayan utk mengisi perut.\nKeesok paginya kami sarapan dengan bersepeda, anak kecil menyewa cidomo krn transportasi hanya sepeda dan cidomo (andong). Pulang pergi dari villa naik cidomo sudah habis 300ribu rupiah. Kalau semua dewasa dan bisa naik sepeda pasti asik, kalau naik cidomo terus bisa tekor hehe..\nBreakfast standart Gili yg sy rasa kurang masuk di lidah orang Indonesia, tapi menu lumayan banyak daripada Scallywag hotel yg di Gili Trawangan. \nVilla dengan harga yg murah tapi cukup luas, hanya saja kebersihan dirasa kurang, terutama utk handuknya kurang bersih, agak berbau. Utk kebersihan ranjang masih oke.\nOverall oke hanya lokasi yg jauh masuk ke permukiman penduduk bikin sy berpikir ulang utk kembali tinggal disana, mungkin kalau dewasa semua bisa mengendarai sepeda sy rasa bukan masalah utk lokasi yg jauh di dlm.\nUtk service jgn ditanya, Scallywag tidak perlu diragukan lagi, semua staff sangat bersahabat dan komunikatif. Kepuasan tamu adalah diatas segalanya, mereka terlihat sangat memperhatikan hal itu. Thanks Scallywag!",

The room however was beautiful, minibar was very well stocked and bathroom was fantastic.  However, it was at least a five minute cycle to breakfast and the pool was quite shaded.  The hotel was lovely but we would have liked to have been somewhere where we could sit on our patio and people or view watch!  It was extremely luxurious though.",

Back then I knew that this is the best hotel on Gili Air. No doubt. Electricity is always working because Scallywags has its own generator, it's clean and superbly furnished with a private patio, and the breakfast buffet is to die for. Just amazing. I came back in November and December 2018 and stayed 4 nights and now I am more convinced that the staff makes this place so excellent. They are the most helpful, professional and amazing people working at Scallywags on Gili Air. They deserve all the praise and admiration more than the rooms and the facilities. ",

We stayed in one of the Scallywag\u2019s Rumah Dua bungalows and our friends in the other. It was perfect as the two rooms have a small private courtyard that can be locked - this was great for quiet afternoon gatherings and storing the bikes. The bikes are highly recommended for easily getting around the island.\nThe accommodation is located about a 5 minute bike ride from the Beach Club, where meals, drinks, sun beds, snorkelling, diving etc. are situated. We found this to be ideal as we could return to our rooms for complete solitude. The swimming pool was great too as it is well shaded, making it a refreshing alternative to the beach.\nThe food was excellent! Breakfast was included in our package and there was enough selection to satisfy everyone. \nThere were no real issues with mosquitoes (we did take repellent of course) or the mosque. \nMake sure you go snorkeling or diving to see the turtles, quite amazing.\nWe look forward to a return visit!\n\n",

The two rooms at Rumah Dua were cool, clean and well presented and the perfect solution for two families travelling together. We enjoyed the setting in the village as it gave us contact with locals and their shops, warungs(restaurants) and laundry services. The pool at Smugglers was spotless and a great escape from the warm sun.The bicycles, through Scallywags, were well maintained and reliable, allowing us a explore the island and whilst they didn't have a bike with a baby seat, quickly organised one from a another provider for us. The bike was essential as the walk to breakfast was a little further/warmer than we had expected. A very enjoyable stay in comfortable surroundings.",

              "text": "Our family of 6 stayed in Joglo 2 for 5 nights.\nThe villa was very private, set in its own garden behind a lockable gate and not overlooked.\nWe were very pleasantly surprised at how spacious the villa is; 2 decent sized double bedrooms and a twin, each with lovely open air shower rooms. There was a big terrace with sofas and a coffee table, plus a big dining table and decent well appointed kitchen. \nThe pool was much more than just a plunge pool as we'd imagined from the photos and there were 6 comfortable sun loungers around it.\nThe villa is a good 15-20 minute walk from breakfast at the beach club, but they will deliver breakfast to the villa if you order it the night before, or you can take the free bikes and cycle down in 5-10 minutes.\nThe staff was excellent. They were there at the jetty to meet us when we arrived, which was lucky as we were being hassled by the many horse and cart men to take us to the villa for a rather large fee....They carried all our cases on their bike handlebars to reception then on to the villa, and were superb during our stay.\nBreakfast at the beach club was good, a decent buffet plus fresh eggs however you want them.\nWe had a seafood BBQ on the beach one night and although a bit expensive for Gili it was the best meal we had. The butterfish was probably the best fish I've ever eaten.\nI would also highly recommend Scallywags divers. They are a very friendly and competent bunch and there are loads of dive sites close by, most teeming with the biggest green turtles I've ever seen.\nThere are lots of cheap warungs close by, good massage places, shops and decent restaurants all over the island. \nOverall everything was pretty much perfect and I would thoroughly recommend this place for a family holiday.",

Lovely beaches and good range of eateries and bars.  The villa was great and well equipped but most of all the Scallywags team went out of their way to help, from the moment we got off the transfer boat to getting their speedboat back over to Lombok. We stayed a week but longer would have been better. Thank you, Rosie and family.",

Small pool ( that our daughter loved) but clean and refreshing. Nice and clean room with good a/c and comfy bed. Wonderful staff! \nA 10 minutes walk to the beach ehere breakfast is served. Good beachclub with comfy beachbeds free of charge. \nWill definately recommend Scallywags to friends. Good value for money! ",

Rooms were lovely with an outdoor open air bathroom with a rain shower which was a great feature. The rooms were clean and amenities replenished daily. The bed was a bit hard but that is common throughout Asia. They had a small plunge pool with loungers if you decided against the ocean or needed some time out of the direct sunlight. Our room had a small terrace that was enclosed behind a gate for privacy. It was very nice to be able to sit out there and enjoy it. \n\nThe hotel included breakfast at their beach club which is another awesome feature. You had to walk or bike less than a kilometer to get the breakfast but It is on the best beach on the island for swimming. You get two sun beds and an umbrella for shade included. I love the sun but this was a nice feature as it was hot and shade was necessary part way through the day. \n\nYou could rent bicycles from the hotel as well which was great. We rode around the island in less than an hour and it made the trip back and forth to the beach more enjoyable. The staff were very friendly and knew our names within a day of arrival. I definitely recommend this hotel. We were sad to leave. ",

There is air conditioning in the rooms. \n\nIt is about a 10-12 min walk to the beach club for breakfast. You did get a sun chair at their beach club. The front row is reserved for scallywag customers. The breakfast is buffet and pretty good. The lunch/dinner menu is good but a bit pricey. \n\nYou can hear the noise from the mosque but it didn't really disrupt me once I was in my room. \n\nI also highly recommend checking out their dive Center, scallywag divers located right next to the beach club.

The menu was surprisingly creative and offered lots of different high quality variations. \nI went for the tuna sashimi as a starter, followed by the grilled butter fish and banana tempura for dessert. Everything was really tasty. \nFor Indonesien standards the service was quite good as well. \nAll in all a fantastic dinner at the beach...!! ",

The room and outside bathroom was beautifully designed and equipped with everything that you want (even a fridge!). While there were power outs on the whole island, our aircon, tv and good wifi worked still. The location is hard to find at first but only a 5 minute walk to the pier and 15 minutes to the beach club where you get a beach bed and towel for free. Also a plus was the breakfast buffet and the beach club that allowed us to grab something before our dives at 8AM and was delicious with everything from eggs to real bread to pancakes and muesli. \n\nThe only small downside we found was that all the guests would reserve a sun chair at 10 AM and not turn up till much later, so when we wanted one at 12 we had to wait an hour where as only 2/3 of the chairs were actually being used. If we can suggest a way to improve this, we'd say that you shouldn't be able to reserve a chair for the whole day at all but just get one as long as you're actually there. \n\nApart from this minor detail we enjoyed our time at Scallywags Hideaway and Gili Air completely and can only recommend staying there if you're looking for a small, homely boutique accommodation!",

The room is small but cute with the comfiest bed I've had so far in Indonesia (including expensive resorts). There are 5 rooms and 2 toilets and 2 showers to share. They were clean albeit one of the showers had a horrible smell. I never had to wait to use anything and the other girls staying at the same time were very clean. \n\nScallywags is easy to reach from the harbour and they had someone waiting for me when I left the boat to take my bag (I booked my transfer from Bali through them).\n\nThe restaurant/beach club is just a 10 minute slow stroll along the beach and does a wonderful western breakfast buffet included in your room price. You can also reserve a beach bed for free. Reserve one at breakfast to save your favourite spot. The dinner bbq was wonderful too albeit service is extremely slow for drinks etc.\n\nThe staff is wonderful. I like the fact that tips are equally shared between them.\n\nTotally recommended and a great first time shared experience. I could've easily stayed longer than my 2 booked nights. ",

              "text": "Me and my boyfriend stayed in Scallywags Hideaway Resort at Gili Air for 7 nights. The arrival was very pleasant, you get a cold towel and a welcome drink. The staff is very kind, interested in their guests and always willing to help you or have a conversation with you. You really feel 'special'.\n\nThe room was very modern, cosy and clean (cleaned every day), and when we arrived, the room was made even more cosy with lights, it was perfect. The bed was perfect, we slept very well. Also there is a good working AC, TV, DVD player with loads of DVD's at the reception, a huge filled fridge and other standard room equipment. The (outdoor) rainshower is very big and comfortable. It is providing hot and cold water. When we walked out of the room, we entered our own private cute terrace. When you open the doors you will enter the 'hall' with a beautiful pool and another bathroom which is also very clean and for everyone to use.\n\nThe breakfast was 15 mins walking from the hotel, but it is worth it. You can get everything you wish for. Different kind of (fresh) juices, smoothies, milkshakes, coffee, tea, cappuccino, soft drinks, etc. The food includes: different types of eggs, different types of pancakes, fresh fruit, Indonesian food, cereals and granola with yoghurt, toasted bread and other warm dishes.\n\nThe sunbeds at the beach in front of ScallyWags restaurant are included in the price and they are reserved for you until 10. Also bikes were included in the price because we have booked through the Scallywags' website. The Scallywags divecenter which is located next to the Scallywags restaurant is the best we've ever dived with. Everything is done for you and you only have to focus on your actual dive. Very relaxed, good planning, nice staff and perfect equipment included. Only one girl (the one with curly hair) wasn't very motivated in our opinion... as well as with paying as with telling us about the dive planning... \n\nA few improvement points for Scallywags could be: the WI-FI login which you have to go throught everytime you have locked your phone, it is very annoying. And also there could be served some more platter for the toast at breakfast (like ham/cheese/salami/etc.)\n\nAll in all, Koen and Gwen would really like to thank all the ScallyWags staff for providing us the best service! Thanks.",

But trust me, the breakfast is well worth the wait!",

For 750k I got a huge clean room with a private terrace, a beautiful bathroom, a mini bar and included two free bottles of water. \n\nIt was really hidden in the middle of Gili A, and was nice and quiet. The pool was amazing, but nor really an alternative to sunbath. \n\nThe staff were amazing and helped you in any way they could, and offered bike rent that I got for free. Just all around a really nice experience, definitely recommended if it fits your budget!\n",

The rooms are very clean, nice size, very thoughtful arrangements for convenience and the best staff.\n\nThe breakfast and the food in the restaurant are not to be missed. Love the Green Juice, Tuna Tataki, Rib eye steak, etc etc... everything in the resto. is nothing short of perfect. We spent 5 nights and definitely coming back soon. The service from the staff is always prompt and proper. They even go a long way to help to accomodate our super early check out. I forgot to take note his name, but one of the staff, ride the bicycle while carrying our 45kg luggage on the bicycle..we would really like to thank him..\n\nKeep up the great team, Scallywags!! We are coming back!",

Loved the island and the Scallywags beach club and restaurant was particularly good. Could easily have had more time on the island. Loved the use of the bikes and our ride around the island was great. Only downside- this resort is right near the mosque which meant during Ramadan that the calls to prayer and reading of the Koran over loud speaker started at 4.30am and went until 10pm. Not sure if it would be different at other times of the year.",

              "text": "We walked from the pier to the hotel and it wasn't far, however wheeling our suitcases was preferable to using the horse and cart for us. We were upgraded at check in which was nice of the smugglers. Spacious room with small private garden and compact outside bathroom. The bathroom is a bit dark at night, but after one of our lights wasn't working they changed this for us. Towels and sheets clean, however one day I had a hole in mine and they show signs of stains - hopefully they get some new ones soon, plus you do have to ask for things to be changed. Polite and friendly staff and free welcome drink. They do have bikes which are free but they are limited and go by 7am. Breakfast is at the smugglers beach, just a short walk and you can use the beach towels and sun beds there afterwards. Buffet breakfast with eggs and pancakes to order. Considering the budget for this room, it's fine and pretty central and has a pool. Only other thing to note is the mosque, they have speakers and so it can be heard from your room. Not a major problem other than it waking us up about 3am one night. ",

The rooms are designed so well, with an 'outdoor' bathroom. The staff were amazing and felt like friends straight away. Scallywags offer sun loungers right on the beach front with their own restaurant a short walk away from the accommodation. We loved Gili's and Scallywags so much we scrapped our plans and went over to Trawangan and also stayed at the Scallywags there.",

Fully stocked mini bar which is reasonably priced, compared to the bars on gili air. Beach club was awsome, nice and quiet, loads of sun loungers for people who were staying there and The staff were fantastic also, couldn't do enough for you. If I come back I would definitely stay here again. Nice little pool area which we never we used. All in all a 5 *****",

The outside bathroom was so pretty and organised. The prints hanging in the room a lovely touch and the furniture quintessentially Balinese.\nThe mini bar was well stocked and to my surprise no government tax on any items so everything was reasonably priced. The pool area was a good size and definitely accommodates those who stay, and it has a rock water feature which is tranquil and very much in the Bali style.  I really could not have asked for more.\nI was so enchanted with this hideaway and I can't wait to visit again.",

Pool wasn't massive but a nice feature, although it was never busy and semi-sheltered, which was a nice change from the big, open beach. Beds were very comfy, rooms were very clean and the dining was all accommodated a short stroll away at their beachfront restaurant. A nice place to spend breakfast where the staff will gladly help you with suggestions on things to do and will also book day and boat tours for you. We did our own private boat which was definitely worth it. Perks include free pushbikes and sunloungers out by the restaurant. The evening BBQ is a must!",

If you need anything, all you have to do is ask.\n\nAs you can see by my pictures, this is really well set up, for comfort and for value. You have to walk down, 5 minutes, to Scallywags Beach to have you breakfast, thats lovely in its self as to see the island in early morning motion.\n\nAll in all a great place and highly recommended and I must mention Hendrawan, for his great chats and his very positive outlook, we looked forward to seeing him in the morning.\n\nThanks everyone, brilliant!",

They even went out of their way to get our bags from the hotel and take them to the marina, in a downpour.  We are a family of 4 and added an extra bed, which worked fine.  Very helpful with the kids as well, including while my wife and I went diving.  The Beach club is a bit of walk for breakfast, but worth it and a great place to kill some time relaxing, snorkeling, etc.  Highly recommended.",

For breakfast you do have to take a short bike ride down to the scallywags restaurant on the water, but we didn't mind. It got us out and about from the moment we woke up.

Would recommend Scallywags Smugglers if you're looking for a value-for-money hotel with a great experience!\n\nThanks to Ripai and everyone at Scallywags Smugglers, and also to Anam and staff at Scallywags Beach Club! \n\nP.S: If you're looking to do some diving while at Gili Air, Scallywag Divers (right next to the Beach Club) is a great dive shop to check out. New, safe, and they go out in small groups, which really makes a world of difference.",

              "text": "Some friends and I decided to get a Villa while we were in Gili Air and boy was it the best decision we made!! Ever thing was top notch and pretty much a steal for the deal we got! Only downside is I wish we were here for a week!\n\nSo here are he pro's and cons to help you decide if this place is for you.\n\nPROS:\n-Great decor and nice open layout for the living area and kitchen!\n- Bathrooms (FYI: partially outdoors) was gorgeous! I didn't mind that it was partially outdoors. I know some aren't too keen on it so this may be a con for you but trust me it's so nice showering there! All very modern rain shower head. \n-The Villa does come with some mosquito repellers that you light up - definitely helpful for the outdoor bathroom situation but honestly mosquito situation wasn't that bad however they did just do a bug spray down that same day.\n-Villa provides bikes for free - much needed to get around the island. The Villa is kind of off the main road but wasn't a problem since we had bikes.\n-Comes with a 5-gallon Filtered Water jug plus 2 bottles of water in each room! \n\nCONS:\n-The mosque singing that happens almost every hour until night starting at the crack of dawn! Some may say this is a deal breaker - I didn't wake up from it but I usually leave a TV on as white noise at night spit probably drowned out the singing for me in the morning. Friends of mine in the other room did wake up early from it. The singing didn't bother me during the day either as we pretty much played our own music when we were hanging outdoors.\n\n@Scallywags - highly suggest you warn your guests about this ahead of time and provide some ear plugs for the guests in those villas - I think this is very much needed.\n\n-The location of the Villa is a bit inconvenient but I think all the amenities the Villa has to offer makes up for it.\n\nIf you want a taste of luxury and relaxation this Villa is a great start!\n\nFYI - The Scallywags restaurant is delish! Wasn't disappointed by any meal I had while I was there and I ate there 3 times!",

They have a chill pool and chairs area, but we didn't use it. \nThey are part of Scallywags beach club, which is about a 6 minute walk to the beach for breakfast. They have a BBQ dinner that is also really really good and a decent value too. \nOn our arrival the staff picked us up at the pier - helpful when their hotel is a bit confusing to get to when you first arrive. It's a good location though. \n\n1 star deduction due to the showers being outdoors. My girlfriend was a bit more than shocked by this at first, as they pictures and description doesn't show or say anything about this. There are mosquitos so outdoor shower in the evening can lead to surprise welts later on if you're not careful. \nOverall we had a great time.",

              "text": "This felt like a little restful paradise tucked away in the middle of busy Gili Air. The rooms and bathrooms were kept very clean throughout our stay. The beach club had a great selection or food and drinks. My favorite thing about this place is that the mini bar had the same prices as buying food and drinks at the restaurant! That made having a beer while changing clothes guilt free. \n\nWe went during New years and the island was packed. If you would like to use the lounge chairs by the beach (they are nice!) get there early in the morning (before 10 am) otherwise you will be out of luck. \n\nThe staff was kind but inconsistent. We waited a long time for service sometimes. We also originally booked Mangos, but when once we went there, lugging our luggage from the boat drop off, it turned out it was full. We ended up having to carry our luggage to Smugglers Hideaway which wasn't too fun but not a huge deal. \n\nThe location is in the middle of a labyrinth of little alley, tightly packed in with other hotels and hostels. It was about a 10 minute walk to the beach club.",

Do not miss out... I am staying with my wife and two kids after escaping from a place with bed bugs. We are all amazed by the place and the staff working here.

When I passingly mentioned I had a craving for pineapple at 10pm they delivered some to my door.

I scheduled my trip back to Lombok with them and they got me a better rate than the hotel was offering. \n\nThe only negative is that they hotel is a bit far from the beach and the hotels restaurant. You can rent a bike next door at Aladdin's homestay and ride over to the Scallywags Smugglers Restaurant and beach. It is about a 5 minute bike ride. You can take alley ways all the way there to speed up your trip without going on the mainroads. \n\nBreakfast is good, tons of options and the highlight is you get a front row chair complimentary at the beach for staying at Scallywags!",

Staff always greeted me with a smile and went above and beyond to make me feel at home. I'd definitely recommend for solo travelers like myself.",

The bikes seem to be in use by other guests, and when they checked out they where broken or something. They said we could rent them for 50 somewhere else! Thats my main reason for giving 4points instead of 5. (I would give 4,5 if i could haha)\n\nTedy and the girl at the reception where also of great help.

Tastefully decorated and peaceful, away from the noisy bars on the beach. Bathrooms are pretty. Kitchen is well equipped if you prefer staying in a cook. Having a bicycle (lent by Scallywags) was very helpful, since the walk to the beach and breakfast is about 15 minutes (to note : if you have young children, Scallywags can help you rent bicycle from shop next door ; child can sit at the back of the bike). The staff responded immediately to my various emails and was very helpful to arrange the travel details (airport pick up with a safe driver, boat which takes you directly to the Scallywags beach club). The food at the Beach Club is very, very good : my husband says the best place to eat in Gili Air. \n\nOur biggest regret was that we stayed only for 2 nights : so we need to go back and stay longer this time. Will probably book PADI diving course with Scallywags Diving Centre.\n\nI took a cooking class near the jetty : I really recommend it.",

We had no ants, bugs, mosquito or other insects in our room during our whole stay of 4 nights which was perfect and not the case in any other accommodation we had during our trip. Staff is nice and helpful. For breakfast you will have to walk approx. 10 min or 5 min by bike to the Scallywags Beach Club. There, you have a big breakfast buffet with a good selection. Furthermore, you can get a sunbed with towels for free and enjoy the day on the beach. We can highly recommend this place!!",

              "text": "We moved to scallywags smugglers from a beachside hut airbnb after two days when we found we needed more amenities, such as better AC and a covered toilet facilities (rainy season!). Smugglers turned out to be so much more. We were delighted.\n\nHuge, comfortable bed and bedding, lovely powerful AC, fridge and stocked minibar with same as outside prices, and despite being inland, it is well placed for restaurants (Ruby's, Sharkbites, Bread, etc nearby) and reaching the main beach area.\n\nThey also offer FREE bike rentals (reserve night before) which made the whole island easily accessible. Also an affordable laundry next-day service is located right across the alley. \n\nBreakfast is included and while it's not on site (it's at the beach bar/restaurant) it's only 5min away by bike and VERY good. Huge hot and cold options to suit euro, local, and American tastes, with delicious made to order banana or pineapple pancakes.\n\nThe entire staff could not have been more helpful or polite, they even hand-carries our luggage down to the pier for us when we checked out. Absolutely recommend Scallywags!! ",

Next day we went back asked about rooms explained what happen within 10min they had us a room for our last two nights on gili air! \nStaff were absolutely outstanding! Everything! We are so very grateful, I have to say there was one staff memeber ( Hendrawan ) who was full of laughs, information seriously deserves a gold medal so much love for him! Cant wait to visit again. Thank you Scallywags for making our stay on gili air.",

A great location to enjoy the island. I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The mini bar selection was brilliant with a fab breakfast selection at the beach club. We also loved the scallywags bikes to explore. Would highly recommend to anyone. ",

Comfy, cosy bed. Absolutely immaculate with plenty of storage, good lighting, excellent AC and a TV.\n\nThe shared bathroom and toilet facilities were also immaculately and I saw them being cleaned multiple times during my stay. Hot water was a nice bonus in the shower!\n\nBreakfast was brilliant - pancakes are so light and fluffy! Staff in the restaurant are very friendly and such a bonus to have access to the beach loungers too. \n\nWould 100% recommend and return. ",

The food was great. We loved Gili Air. It's a good mix of quiet, romantic nightlife and bustling during the day. We cannot thank Teddy and Sunpardi enough for their above and beyond service. My husband and I needed medical care when we were visiting and they helped us find a doctor and even went with us to the clinic to translate. We will be back and highly recommend this to anyone traveling here.",

              "text": "Overall, this is a nice, clean boutique hotel that offers good value.  Although it is not located on the beach, it is only a 5-10 minute walk to the harbor, and it is really easy to rent a bike to get around.  Rooms are clean and functional, and wi-fi is good and reliable.  Management is friendly and helpful.  There is a shared swimming pool in the courtyard although we did not have time to use it.  Like most hotels on Gili Air, this is a small, intimate property.  It is quiet and laid back.\n\nBreakfast is good - served at Scallywags Restaurant which is a short bike ride or about a 15 minute walk along the harbor.  \n\nThere are several Scallywags properties on Gili Air.  The most well-known are the restaurant, beach club and dive shop that are located in the opposite direction from the harbor than this hotel.  If you know where to go, it is fast and easy to there.  If not, it can be challenging.  If you arrive on a fast boat, trom the harbor, make a left hand turn, go toward the fast boat ticket offices and look for the signs on the signposts.  Beware that if you ask someone how to get to Scallywags, they will probably point you toward the restaurant which is not where you want to check in, and it is a long walk with baggage in tow.\n\nWe definitely recommend this hotel and will go back next time we are in Gili Air.",

It is quite hot in the back lanes of Gili Air so this place was a welcome retreat and even though we had a basic room it was cool and a nice space to chill. Breakfast is served at the Scallywags restaurant on the beach and was excellent fare. Even though you had to walk from your hotel to the beach it worked well. Only stayed one night but could have made this our base for our stay on this favoured island of the Gilis",

So if you want to get to breakfast be aware of that, didn't really bother us that much.\n- Pool doesn't get a huge amount of sun due to the big tree looming over it - but we spent most of the days out and about.\n\nAll in all would definitely visit again, at that price point its luxury for less!",

Room had a window to the terrace, nice outdoor bathroom. Rooms were quite small, but enough room for two big bags. Very clean and outdoor bathroom was very modern. remember to take earplugs since the prayers start in the morning, if you are not willing to listen that \n\nwe rented bikes, and it was very nice to ride to the beach club for breakfast. also took couple of minutes. Also biking around and to see sunsets was nice. Not worth biking aroun the island, since it's very difficult in some places. Maybe easier to go one way one eay and the other way the other day. \n\nBreakfast at the club veru good, also dinner. \nThey make a reservation for sunbed for you, if you go diving in the morning. They had a brand new dive shop as well. All the equipment looked very new. \n\nVery nice place after my conserns in the beginning.\n\n50 minutes from the hotel, very good pizzaplace!\n\nWifi worked occasionally.",

Any requests or issues were always solved promptly. Special mention to Tedy who was always very obliging and patient with our questions! No problem was ever too big for them. Breakfast was good, buffet style with an egg and pancake station. Mini bar prices were also reasonable (a rarity these days). Wifi and aircon worked well. There's a safe in the room too.\n\nNo surprise this place is booked out early so plan ahead!",

The garden is glorious, there is a wonderful plunge pool and the house is fantastic.  It reminded us a bit of Elle Decor.  Very elegant but cool furnishing/decorations.  Great bikes are right at the property and ready to go.  The staff was great.  Some people in other reviews felt that the walk to breakfast was a bit of a bother but we rode our bikes everyday and loved it.  What a cool way to get to breakfast but to ride along the bike alley ways.  The breakfast is moderate but fine.  The beach club is good.  Great drinks, decent food and beautiful beach. The dive shop is wonderful as are the staff!  We HIGHLY recommend this villa and Scallywags.  (Do keep in mind it is not the four seasons when it comes to service but totally fine - you are in Gili Air).",

The whole complex is immaculate and the room extremely clean 10/10!\nMy only complaints are the water is cold in the morning until about 8am. I spoke to reception and they looked surprised but next morning it was the same. The guy on reception said he would speak to the \"engineering\" about it. I suggested that they turn the water heater on earlier!\ud83d\ude00\nAnyway, it wasn't a major problem because I was going swimming or snorkelling every morning!\nThe only other problem was the internet, which continually drops out. I was able to work around it but it was a little annoying! Yes...I know this is Indonesia....but!!!\ud83d\ude00\nOverall, despite these minor negatives I would come back here due to the nice staff.

The smugglers is about 7 mins from the beach resort which can be a bit of a pain when it is hot and you are carrying snorkel gear. We had 2 rooms and really enjoyed the space and outside hot showers which were very good. The areas for improvement. Everyday it became a family game to guess how many towels we would be left with. There was also someone banging on the door at 7.30 am on our last morning wanting to know if we had consumed anything from the mini bar- not the best way to be woken. And finally there were some issues with the booking and the bill that did get resolved but really should have been not been an issue. Anyway would recommend it. We will be back. ",

It isn't... it is a lot further inland and right next to the mosque.  Loud prayers start at 5am.  We paid big money for two nights, but paid extra and shifted the second night to a quiet location (we didn't tell the staff... just moved for the night and checked out as scheduled).  The other thing I found misleading was I assumed that pictures of the kitchen and living areas were located inside the house but they aren't... only the bedrooms are which means there are no living areas that are aircon.  On the positive side... the staff were great, especially the girl in the reception (beautiful nature and very helpful).  This place is not good value for money as it is one of the most expensive on the island.",

Free water in the rooms and fully stocked mini bar. \nBathrooms are outdoor with hot water for a great shower. \nBreakfast is served at scallyways beach bar about a 10 minute walk in the morning past the harbour. \nStaff are al very welcoming and will do anything to help you have a good stay. Checkin is easy and quick and they will hold your bags for the day while you go relax. \nWe took a horse and cart to get here from the pier because of heavy bags and not being entirely such which scallywags we had booked but it's really not far and when we checked out we walked instead to the pier, 5 minutes. \nTickets for the boat transfers can be bought directly at the pier. To meno is cost 35,000 each. \n\nOnly gripe is that the wifi isn't strong enough to download or have a good Skype but I don't think it was good anywhere we visited on the Gili's. ",

              "text": "This accommodation was very nice. The room was large, clean and modern. Gorgeous private patio with pretty palms and beautiful outdoor shower with deluxe rain shower head. Comfortable bed. The in room mini bar was fully stocked with drinks and yummy nibbles, catering to the westerner. Satellite tv channels with dvd player and reliable wi-fi too. Most importantly, the air con was icy cold. It is very hot on Gili Air. The rooms and accommodation are very secure so it feels very safe and private. There is a lovely shared pool which is gorgeous for an evening swim. We had to walk a few minutes each morning to another scallywags Joglo villa which they had set up for buffet breakfast, but this was no problem as it was close and the earlier you get up, the cooler the weather is! Their beach club restaurant called Scallywags is currently closed to the public which is why we had to eat breakfast in another location. The buffet breakfast options weren't huge but it was sufficient. The accommodation is located about a 10-15 minute walk from the beach, but we weren't fussed about this as we found the beach and ocean on Gili Air to be dirty and full of rubbish anyway. It is currently the month of Ramadan, which we didn't know about before our arrival and the accommodation is located close to a large mosque on the island and you will hear prayers 5x daily, starting at 4am. The Reception staff are lovely and Lalu in house keeping, is a very kind and funny person. Overall, a pleasant stay.",

We arrived and were very hot, and a bit disappointed to see a large group sitting in the very small office checking in before us; which meant we had to wait outside in the hot sun. After waiting outside for a few warm minutes, a young gentleman named Lalu saved us from the heat and pulled some strings to get us into our room early, and later brought the check in documents to our room let us check in inside with the AC. \nAfter that, We asked Lalu where we could get a large gallon of water. Without hesitation he offered and went to the store and grabbed one for us. It was such a sweet gesture as we were truly boiling and had no idea where anything was. \nI later found out Lalu isn't even management, he worked for the house cleaning crew! He went out of his way to help us all week. I think this man needs a raise!\nI was disappointed by the management and regular crew from the hotel as they were always hard to find and we had to wait to get our breakfast vouchers every morning. \n\nAll in all the hotel is clean, with beautiful rooms and FANTASTIC air-con. I would stay again. Thanks to Lalu for a great stay and exceptional service. ",

We tried to book a standard double room for 3 nights, but since they didn't have vacancy all 3 nights they upgraded us to Scallywags Joglo, a gorgeous private villa with a private pool, outdoor kitchen & living room, for the same price! We are in awe of how beautiful it is. Everything is incredibly clean & the staff is very helpful. A big perk of staying at Scallywags is getting a free beach bed & towel at their beach spot everyday. The free breakfast buffet is also great. Can't recommend enough.",

              "text": "After we had got over the shock that we had a ten minute walk for breakfast we settled down to really enjoy smugglers in gilli air.  The room was excellent with a half outdoor bathroom and had very good sound proofing which led to us having peaceful sleep.\nIt was all very private.  Sadly they forgot to service our room on our last day but that was partially rectified.  The breakfast and restaurant were excellent - some tables on the sandy beach with sunbeds in front and a dive shop to the right.  Brilliant for a lazy day of sun and swimming.  We went on two snorkel trips and found the staff very helpful.",

Having a shower in the morning with the sun glistening over the water is a first class experience. \nThe Smugglers is tucked away out of sight from the main street and therefore a quiet, peaceful place to stay. However it is within walking distance to the harbour which is a big advantage when you arrive on Gili Air. \nThe beach club is joined with the Smugglers and provides breakfast. This is a 10-15 minute walk away so the location aspect discourages you from going to breakfast which is ashamed however for lying by the beach it is a good location and towels are provided. \nOverall friendly staff, good location, clean and would highly recommend staying here.",

Tucked away in the main village of Gili Air, reception is an office right on the street and the 10 rooms are accessed via large door on the street into a very private hotel space. Our room had a private walled garden that was immaculately kept. The room was clean, tidy and plenty big enough with a outdoor shower in the ensuite. There is a nice pool under shade that is relatively small but great to come back to after a hot day at the beach. There are no eating facilites here - these are at a sister property Scallywags Beach Club right on the beach in the main roam up from the ferry jetty. It is a really nice 10 min walk to the beach club for breakfast etc. Breakfast was superb - fantastic eggs station, buffet and you then get complimentary use of a daybed right out front on the beach. There is an excellent local warung and a pizza place within 2 mins walk for dinner each night as well as plenty of other eating choices. We loved 4 days there and have already booked the next visit later in the year.",

              "text": "We booked Scallywags Smugglers Hideaway because we wanted to get away from the hustle and bustle - Gili Air for that reason was a great choice itself already. \n\nThe property is only a short walk away from the harbour - if you don't carry too much luggage you can walk there - it's not even 5 minutes up the road. \nThe staff, especially Fai, the manager, was very polite and helpful during our entire stay. \n\nOne small hiccup: I got an email a few days in advance asking if I needed assistance upon arrival since i was traveling with an infant I I had requested to be picked up upon booking confirmation. Fai contacted me and re-confirmed the new pick up time of 11:30 am (when the Gili Cat Fastboat arrives), but unfortunately nobody was there to pick us up. I had to call them and then one staff turned up on a bike. Not very helpful when you have a suitcase and a baby with you. \nIn the end we got a horse carriage, paid by Scallywags as requested and the whole thing really only took 15 minutes to sort out, no big deal. \n\nThe room was clean, neat and cool, black-out curtains and had all the usual amenities you'd expect. The outdoor seating area is a bit small, but again: you won't spend much time there, however the communal pool area really makes up for it. Great place for an afternoon nap! \n\nBreakfast was included and served at the Beach Club, I recommend to rent bikes to save you the walk every morning. It is a bit of a walk if you're travelling with children. You can even rent a bike with a child seat (from the bike rental place opposite the harbour)! \n\nAll in all, we'd come back to Scallywags for sure, especially because the beach club opens up to one of the most beautiful beaches of the island, clean and protected shallow water, gorgeous view over Lombok, nice staff, free sun beds and towels for all Scallywags guests. Baby really enjoyed running around freely there!",

The staff were very hospitable and were always there to offer a helping hand or answer any questions we had. The only gripe is that the hotel is a 6 minute walk away from the beach. \n\nUpon leaving we accidentally left both our apple ipad mini and an amazon kindle ereader behind in one of the rooms. The staff were quick to respond to our emails and shipped it back to us within two days. Am amazed at the way they handled the situation and extremely grateful to them. I cannot thank you enough for making our stay such a pleasant and enjoyable experience.",

From the outside - it looks deceptively small but the rooms are tastefully designed and spacious. Loved the front porch part of the room and the outdoor bathroom! The swimming pool was a godsend for my daughter at the end of a day on the beach! \nThe beach club was a cool place to hang and chill. The beach was great and snorkelling really easy from here.

Alleyways leading to the hotel were filthy and flooded. Most disappointing part was that the hotel charged my credit card without telling me (I had opted to pay in cash on my booking), and then still allowed us to pay in cash when we were checking out! After multiple phone calls and emails, I finally got them to agree to return the money however they said they could not refund to my credit card!! Eventually, after about 3 weeks, they transferred the money to my bank account and of course I paid the bank charges. I didn't receive any real apology or compensation, they seemed to think it was an acceptable mistake. Not overly impressed with Gili Air - stick to Trawangan!",

If there is a nicer accommodation in the Gili's I don't know about it. Like the Hideaway, this 3 bedroom Joglo is tucked away in the middle of the island about a 12-minute walk to Scallywags Beach Club. For a family of 5 it is ideal. Fully stocked kitchen with beautiful, new stainless steel appliances and granite counter tops. Great lighting - plus a Bose home speaker with a built-in iPhone 5/6 jack. Perfect sized private pool. And the indoor/outdoor bathrooms and showers are as good as it gets in Indonesia. Plus yummy beds, bedding, linens and pillows. And the Joglo comes with its own cellular \"concierge\" phone which has about 5 preloaded numbers in it, any one of which will ring to various Scallywags staff who will then take care of whatever you are needing - from \"room service\" to more towels to arranging a water taxi. \n\nPerhaps a negative for some people is that there is a large mosque about 50 meters away, and the 5x daily call to prayer may be an issue, but it wasn't for us. All part of the cultural immersion. \n\nAll in all, we love Gili Air and we love the new Scallywags Joglo. It was absolutely lovely - and a great value. We will be back!",

We have 2 3 bedroom private pool Joglo villas, they were a fun project & only newly finished, you were one of our very first guests to stay. The idea of having your own private oasis, not too far from the beach is most appealing & already the Joglo's are becoming popular.\n\nThanks very much for your huge rave review & we look forward to seeing you again soon.\n\nScallywags Management \nGili Air Joglo's ",

We switched rooms from the regular to ruma dua (because of the extension) - they took care of our luggage and it was a smooth transition. We actually liked the ruma dua a bit better because it had a bigger and relaxter terrace outside to chill. \nThe beach is indeed a couple of minutes walking from the room, but we did not mind at all. We would take everything we needed in the morning,  have some nutella pancakes and made to order eggs at breakfast and either relax on the reserved beds or explore the island from there.\n\nAbsolutely great and friendly staff!

Just a couple minutes walk from the harbour, this place is a brilliant hideaway. With gorgeous, modern rooms and your own private front garden. We were first a little sceptical about being away from the beach but it actually made no difference and we like that you could escape the beach/sun and lounge by the shaded pool at Scallywags. The staff are so attentive (even saving us from a few large creepy crawlies). Breakfast is served at the beach club (5-10 mins walk) and its the best breakfast we had in Bali. Also, the free sun loungers and comfy chairs throughout the beach club are a massive bonus! Highly recommend staying here :)",

The rooms are clean, beautiful and cleaned every morning. \nFree water at the room, nice pool, great \"outdoor\" bathroom, great towels and most important of all - a great bed. \nWe had some trouble with the water flow at the first room we were checked into, but that sure turned out not to be a problem. They immediately helped us move our stuff into another room. I can't point out enough how KIND and helpfull the staff were. \nAlways asking what you are going to do, where, when ect. and always ask how it was when you get back home. It really felt like being home. If you have any questions at all, just ask the staff - if they don't know the answer, they will find out and then tell you.\nIt was absolutely amazing and also really romantic for a couple like us. \n\nThe hideaway is located a 10 minutes walk from the beach and their beach club (their restaurant where you eat breakfast) but that was in fact really nice. A little walk every morning is nice and because of the distance to the beach, it was always quiet at the hotel. \n\nBreakfast is great - try out their banana pancakes! Yum. \n\nCouldn't have imagined a better place to stay.",

You have your own little bungalow away from the hustle and bustle of the beach. The staff was amazing and the unit was excellent. With your own little veranda and patio area and good size for 2. The A/C which is necessary was excellent and the room very comfortable. \n\nThe pool is a little small but then again you are on an island surrounded by beach. The breakfast is a ways away at Scallywags Restaurant and it was just ok. I am not much of a breakfast person so it didn't bother me but there are better food options on the island.",

I didn't like the breakfast very much nor the Scallywags restaurant - there are better choices on the island. You are right next to Classico Pizza which has the best pizza I have ever eaten (and my husband is Italian) - we actually went back twice! It is run by a lovely Italian couple who have been on Gili Air for 2 years. \n\nThe staff here were lovely and very helpful. If I were to come back to Gili Air though I would stay more towards the north side which is even more remote and quiet, although you have less choice of places to eat.",

Room has a small entrance area, large bedroom & good sized outdoor bathroom. 10/10 cleanliness (especially the outdoor bathroom!). Very modern and well thoughts out. Turn down service nightly with water. Also offered in the room: blow dryer, flash light, converter, umbrella, mini bar, robes, etc. The a/c is excellent in the room & wifi is a bit slow (to be expected on an island). The private pool for the rooms is quiet & clean. Breakfast is located at the Scallywags beach bar (8 min walk, 4 min cycle): buffet style including hot bar, cereals, fresh orange juice, yogurt, Balinese or Nescaf\u00e9 coffee. Also on offer is cooked to order pancake & egg station. Staff are excellent & eager to help always. Can also have access to beach chairs right on the water free of charge. The only possible improvement would be to have bikes available for guests (we rented ours down the street but they were a bit worse for wear).  \n\nGreat stay - highly recommended. ",

The room also comes with a buffet breakfast at the restaurant (a 10 minute walk away) and free access to the beds on the beach - it all ran very smoothly and professionally, and made our stay very relaxing. Would come back again and recommend to others! The only (very minor) qualm I would have is the complimentary small water bottles provided every day - given the waste problem the islands seem to be dealing with, it would be more environmentally friendly to have a water machine in the room or lobby that we could refill bottles with, rather than producing more waste.",

              "text": "We absolutely loved our stay at Smugglers Hideaway. The last time I visited Gili Air, we stayed in a bungalow on the beach, so I was a bit apprehensive about staying off the beach in the village. But I actually enjoyed it even more! \n\nWe had half a dozen restaurants and mini marts within a few hundred metres - a great way to sample a range of local food. There are no restaurant facilities on site at Scallywags, but this was also not a problem for us. We really enjoyed the walk to the Scallywags beach club for the breakfast buffet (huge variety and both egg and pancake station) and the in-room mini bar was good value (although the free mineral water is limited to 1 bottle per person per day). \n\nI loved the pool because it was under shade cloth and therefore always cool - a boon when the Gilis can be so hot!\n\nThe staff were all fantastic - friendly, efficient and professional, leaving the rooms spotlessly clean every day. Check in was a breeze. \n\nYou also get a free sun lounge at the scallywags beach club which you can reserve all day, and put any drinks and food on your hotel bill - super convenient!! And the snorkelling gear we hired from the dive shop was great quality and value at 45,000rp per day! And... we got to swim with sea turtles - bliss. \n\nAll in all, a pretty perfect stay!",

              "text": "Scallywags Smugglers is a little gem. It is situated away from the main port but it is only a short walk from this jetty and the main strip. Highlights is the little courtyard entrance each room has, it also has a nice small and clean pool. Smugglers is a good escape when you want to take a break from the rest of the island! Nice and quiet too. It doesn't have an adjacent restaurant so no room service etc (would be handy when you're not feeling 100%) but we didn't mind - Scallywags restaurant is only a short walk and has the added bonus of snorkelling right in front. You can hire gear next door. Highly recommend Smugglers in terms of Gili Air standards!!",

              "text": "Rooms are clean and handsomely designed. We loved having a private outdoor garden and porch. The A/C worked well, the shower stayed hot and well-pressured, and the mini-bar was stocked to the gills. The room has robes, a blowdryer, and an in-room safe (no, you can't fit your laptop inside it). The indoor pool is small but pretty, but the water doesn't get particularly warm and they turn the \"waterfall\" off early. Boat transfers are easy to arrange, albeit at extortionary prices. The breakfast is generous, tasty, and very Anglo-friendly. Welcome drinks are made with fresh juice. WiFi was surprisingly fast and reliable.\n\nAs mentioned already, this hotel is a 10+ minute walk from the beach club. Its isolation from the main drag makes for a quieter stay, plus it puts you closer to some good restaurants (Shark Bites, Classico). The distance is only irritating when the sun is beating down and you're dragging your suitcase to/from the pier. (Staff only helped us one way; after check-out, we were on our own, wham bam thank you ma'am.)\n\nSpeaking of the staff, we were more than a little irritated by their nonstop snickering in Bahasa during our checkout. Not sure what could possibly be so amusing about paying one's bill, but we were so annoyed at their behavior, we declined to leave a tip. (Not so funny any more, is it boys?)\n\nWe recommend renting snorkeling gear from the dive shop next to the beach club, but DO NOT rent bikes from the recommended vendor near the hotel; these bikes are in terrible condition (broken seats, soft brakes, etc.). More importantly, the tires are too narrow to peddle on the sandy paths of Gili Air. You'll wind up walking your bike halfway around the island instead of riding it. My suggestion instead if you plan to circle the island on two wheels: Rent one of the bikes with the big wheels at a place in town; only the fatter tires can handle the sand.\n\nAll told, Scallywags was a mixed-bag experience. It certainly didn't help that Gili Air was a MAJOR disappointment in terms of beaches and snorkeling\u2014the main reason we came. Most of the coral is bleached and/or broken, and I've seen more fish in tanks at Chinese restaurants than I did in two days underwater here. The beaches are shallow, loaded with sharp, crushed shells, and not particularly beautiful. In general, this island just wasn't our vibe: chill and laid-back, sure, but also filled with lots of hippies and burnouts. If we had it to do over, we wouldn't have bothered staying the night.",

It is lovely and quiet and, although at first it seems like a long walk, the morning stroll to breakfast is a good way to start the day. The staff here are very helpful and accommodating, unlike those at the main hotel who were somewhat abrupt and dismissive. As mentioned by others the mini bar is reasonably priced and well stocked, presumably because there is no bar here and all food services have to be sent up from the other hotel and this can take time. My only problem with the stay was the breakfast and room service food. Breakfast always seemed to have been sitting around forever, even at 7am, with the exception of the egg stop, all other food was rather stale and not very warm. In addition the coffee with breakfast was instant or pay extra - for the price I think fresh coffee is not too much to ask for. Finally I ordered a salad from room service and it was disgusting. \nSo - great hotel - lousy food.",

Our room wasn't big but it was the perfect size for the aircon unit to cool completely in a short period of time.  The room was clean and toilet/shower were in an open air room.\n\nThe staff here were fantastic, very friendly and helpful.  What we loved the most was that the Classico Italiano restaurant was literally situated just around the corner.  Their pizzas are absolutely amazing!  Probably the best I've ever had.  I also liked the small pool area just inside the gates where I relaxed in the sun when my partner wanted to sleep in a little.\n\nThe only negative we had with the hideaway was that we had to walk 10-15mins to have breakfast at the Scallywags Beach Club each morning.",

I can't say anything negative about the actual hotel, the only thing i would say is that it's a little far out from the action.  which is great for getting a good nights sleep but a little far out if you want to keep going to the main strip.  Also there isn't a view at all and I have to say when I saw the other beach side villas I was envious.  Having said that scallywags is immaculate and you can't fault the service.  But for those who want to be in the thick of things this may be too far out.  I've written a review on my website if anyone fancies having a look before booking.  you can find my link in my profile :)",

Our walk took us through small paths flanked by local cottages with a friendly Kampong atmosphere. When we weren't sure which way to proceed the locals were quick to point the way. \n\nOur check in was delayed due to a guest overstaying in our room, but the manager was quick to compensate us when he heard of our inconvenience. And made sure to apologise in person. \n\nThe room was very comfortable, clean and modern. The roofless shower was a wonderful bonus. \n\nIt is about a 10 minute walk to breakfast at the scallywags beach club (bar and restaurant) , but we did not mind the walk.  \n\nScallywags residents get free deck chairs at the beach club, and access to one of the better beaches. Outsiders have to rent the deck chairs. So hanging out at the deck chairs became a regular activity for us. \n\nBreakfast was yummy. The banana pancakes were my favorite. \n\nStaff were incredibly attentive and warm, always with a ready smile. ",

Air conditioning, refrigerator, safe and clean rooms. There is a bike rental place next door. I highly suggest getting a bike if you stay here otherwise its a long HOT walk from the main drag. Free access to the beach club is included. We went EVERYDAY. It was the best food, beach and swimming on the island there. Make a reservation at breakfast for you chairs at the beach club. They will hold them for you all day. They sell the chairs after 10am to the public. Everything you need is at the Beach Club. Everything is quality here.  An extensive breakfast buffet is included everyday. ",

              "text": "We stayed here as a couple and a couple of friends in August- September 2015.......Great staff who were constantly smiling, helpful and friendly. We had a massive lovely spread for breakfast every day and it is all delicious, there is Balinese rice and noodles, pancake, fresh fruit, toast, full english breakfast (with proper pork sausages), freshly made omelette/egg station and homemade granola and cereals with yoghurt. We are massive foodies, anyone that loves food must eat here, it is seriously soo good. The service in the restaurant is great, we were well looked after by a lovely english girl called Annabelle and her team who are always welcoming. The restaurant is genuinely some of the best food on the island and a really nice place to be in the evenings with wooden tables on the beach and candlelit dinners. They do a bbq every night that is really well priced where you can have fresh fish. The restaurant is situated right on the beach with lovely white sun loungers and sunshade umbrellas with full waiting service all day, it overlooks Lombok with views of Mount Rinjani to the left and you are right on the turquoise sea to take a dip in to cool off every now and then. We stayed in Smugglers Ruma Dua, we were two couples with a room each and the great thing about this setup is its effectively one building split into two separate apartments within its own private garden. Whilst we knew the other couple next door if you didn\u2019t you still have plenty of privacy. We were able to treat it as our own little complex and sat out together in the garden in the evenings listening to music and drinking cold Bintang like a private villa. The swimming pool here is gorgeous, with its own tropical waterfall surrounded by plants and within a silent little oasis. I liked how all the parts of Scallywags were a little walk apart as you end up having a really nice quiet peaceful sleep away from the business of the beach area and main strip but then walking down to the beach for your breakfast. I can\u2019t recommend it enough, a really nice place to stay, we spent our daytimes out diving with Ben who runs their dive school from Scallywags Dive, they have a great setup where you are totally looked after by the boat staff, you don\u2019t need to lift a finger. Their fantastic divemaster Rama leads the fun dives and literally finds all the best stuff, our dives were full of turtles, peacocktail shrimp, orangutan crab, we even saw a manta ray!",

Quite a bit of a walk to the beachfront cafe for breakfast though. Breakfast buffet selection was small but well prepared. Hotel guests are allowed to book a beach chair for free before 10am- very relaxing. In general a very peaceful and comfortable place. Would book again.",

Greeted by the friendly Scallywags staff on the beach, we were given a welcome drink and told to grab lounger to chill out until our room was ready. Bags were taken to  Smugglers for us and then a nice dude on a bike walked us to the place. \n\nWonderful accommodation which is tucked away in the village but only a 5-10min walk from the main strip. Really clean and with a beautiful pool! Just top notch! The food at Scallywags is awesome, with a beach BBQ and all you can eat salad bar. Highly recommend this place!",

We were offered a discount and a room move. Staff were there to move us from the beach room to Smugglers. The rooms were beautiful and clean (somehow - with all that sand!). The location is great - it's super quiet and in with the locals who are lovely. \n\nYou can easily get drinks and snacks from the little houses and shops around. The pool was lovely but we barely used it preferring to head to breakfast at the beach club and then spending the day there (lounges are reserved for guests until 10am). Breakfast was delicious - lots of options with egg station and breakfast buffet \n\nEvery interaction we had with staff was great. They were helpful and kind - going out of their way to make sure we were enjoying our stay. We hired bikes from them, got bar and restaurant recommendations.. anything you need. The managers - Annabelle and Ben - were amazing. Always interacting with guests.. helping staff. It was easy to see they love their jobs. \n\nI would head back to Scallywags in a heartbeat - I never wanted to leave!",

              "text": "My friend and I stayed here for a night in August and it was just what we were after. The accommodation was excellent - well kept, clean and to a high standard. I saw a complaint about the 'small pool' but when you have the ocean on your doorstep it is the perfect size for an afternoon dip. In my opinion the pool area was great - a very relaxing space. The accommodation is about 5 minutes from the harbour and yes you have to walk off the main strip but this keeps it tucked away and noise free away from the bars at night. No complaints from our side!\n\nSmugglers restaurant is also fantastic. Breakfast is included and offers a wide selection. On the odd occasion popped in for lunch or dinner also. It is slightly more expensive than other places but well worth it. The food is of a high standard and I often found myself wishing I had eaten there on the number of times we did not.\n\nFinally staff are absolutely amazing! Not a bad word to say. Annabelle and the team could not have made us feel more welcome and took time to get to know us individually. Real friendly atmosphere.\n\nWould definitely recommend both accommodation and staff.",

Whilst Gili Air is the middle sized island, Smugglers very quickly became the only place for us to be! The staff were so friendly. Nothing was too much! Not even when I broke our safety deposit box with everything in it!!\n\nThe Scallywags restaurant is the best place to eat on the island. Food was fantastic and prices were reasonable. The tables on the beach were a great touch. Better still, the staff reserve your beach sun loungers for you during breakfast so there is no fighting for space! Another nice touch. Oh, and the breakfast is epic!!\n\nThe rooms were very clean and always cool when we returned in an evening.\n\nThe hotel even arranged a private boat for our onward journey to Gili Trawangan for 50,000 rupiah per person.\n\nThis is the only place you should be considering staying at if you're heading to Gili Air!!",

The rooms were clean, the staff friendly and the shower... awesome :-) The breakfast in the beach club which is a 10-minute walk away, was a little disappointing but speaking in high standards. Would go back to Scallywags anytime!",

It's located a bit more inland from the beach but it is only a short walk from the Smugglers Restaurant. The rooms are extremely comfortable and the outdoor bathroom is fantastic. Wi-fi could be improved as the signal was quite weak but I suppose sometimes it's nice to be internet free! The staff were amazing as they were always extremely helpful and went out their way to make us feel welcomed. They even booked a private snorkeling trip for us. If I'm ever back on Gili Air, I would definitely try to book this hotel again!",

We're not ones to just lounge around but since there was no surf we just laid on the beach all day. This was a highlight for our one month stay in Bali. The price was very reasonable for what it is, especially on the holiday. Stay here and you will not regret it.",

              "text": "I was pleasantly surprised that after staying 5 nights at a 5 star luxury boutique private villa in Ubud that Scallywags was practically just as nice. I admit I had low expectations especially after walking down the dirt path to get there but the second we opened the doors it was like entering an oasis. \n\nOur room was pristine, had lots of space, good lighting, nice outdoor bathroom with fresh water and a rain shower and a little front deck where we left all of our shoes and sandy/wet beach attire. Our room also had a fridge and air conditioning which was appreciated and used since it's really lovely and hot in Gili Air. I was actually told by a few locals on the island that this hotel was the nicest on the island and I would definitely believe it! We had a great time. I should note that we felt very safe there and it was nice and quiet as well. I was particularly impressed that they had wifi AND HBO! I was able to catch some of Wimbledon, my favorite tennis tournament without any trouble. \nPart of our room rate was the breakfast buffet at their beach club, which is about 10 minutes away walking along the beach. Normally I can't stand buffets as the food is usually left out for hours and has flies around it. Again Scallywags beat all expectations! Their buffet was delicious! They had someone who made yummy omelets and pancakes as well. We would eat breakfast and then sit right in the beach in one of their comfy beach chairs with table service. It was ideal and I felt very well looked after. One more perk of staying at Smugglers was its close proximity to the island's best restaurant - Classico. We ate there most nights. \n\nI would certainly return to this beautiful island and I would most definitely stay again at Scallywags Smuggler's Hideaway.",

The design in the room is very nice and eye for detail is superb. Nice minibar assortiment and not too expensive, very comfy bed and shower in open air. Breakfast is buffet where you can order panaches and eggs to your liking. They also offer free use of stretchers at the beach and this beach is the best on the Island. ",

The rooms are in the middle of the island - when you get off the boat, it's a very easy walk straight up the middle of the island and down a road to the left. The pool is small, but beautiful, although we spent all our time on the beach. The restaurant food is great, and you can use the sunbeds out in front. Definitely go to the Classico restaurant next door to the where the rooms are based, really amazing stone-baked pizzas! The room was very clean, it was quiet, and the DVD selection is great if you do fancy a night in. I would definitely recommend this place, it's a lovely little hideaway.",

              "text": "This was our first time to the Gili Islands and Gili Air was recommended as a good choice - not as busy as Gili T and not as quiet as Gili Meno. Gili Air is pretty quiet but there are a few beachside restaurants/bars that give you a social fix. The food is great, particularly the bbq'd fish at the Chill Out Bar. \n\nWe chose Scallywags Smugglers based on the reviews here on Tripadvisor. It was a great choice. Our room was very spacious and spotlessly clean. We had our own terrace area, free internet and a gorgeous outdoor shower. It felt really luxurious. \n\nBreakfast was at the Scallywags restaurant/bar about a 5 min walk from the accommodation.  As a guest of the Smugglers you get a free lounger on the beach at the Scallywags restaurant/bar. The staff are super friendly and have great tips on what to do on the island. \n\nWe walked all around the island in about 2 hours (we dawdled alot) and walked to the turtle beach at the other side of the island (it took us all of 20 mins) to watch the gorgeous sunset. \n\nThis island is beautiful and very relaxing. Scallywags Smugglers is a perfect choice for a bit of luxury at a very affordable price. When you arrive just head to Tourist Information by the port and they will point you to Smugglers, just a 4 min walk away. \n\nWhen you get to Smugglers there may not be anyone at reception - just head into the resort and walk towards the services room towards the back, someone is always there.  We had arrived early and left our luggage with the staff while we went to the beach bar for a welcome drink. We returned after about 40 mins at which time our room was ready. A quick shower and then out to explore the island. There is even a torch in the room to take with you in the evenings so that you can find your way back :)",

The restaurant was on the beachfront and served the best steaks we've ever had!\n\nOne thing I'd say is that my husband contacted Scallywags before we arrived to say we were on honeymoon but we didnt receive a little extra something to make it a bit more special. The other three hotels we stayed in for honeymoon gave us chocolate covered stawberries, flower garlands and a chocolate cake, so that was a bit disappointing but despite that we had a great time there. Its literally two mins walk from all the bars which was great for us but maybe not so great if you want a quiet relaxing break?",

              "text": "I stayed at \"Ruma Dua\" with my partner for 5 nights, the room is very private with a nice paved courtyard. The bed was slightly hard, the bathroom a bit smelly and there was a gap around the entrance door, allowing mozzies in, so we would keep it shut with a chair in front of it at night time, so no real problem.\nBoth front door and courtyard doors have double locks on it, giving it security.\nThere was also a safe in the room, as well as a small torch, which we would use at night as we cycled.\nThe staff were absolutely wonderful, especially Fa'i, who was always ready to help with anything and even organised two bikes to be brought to our rooms. He even found something we had accidently left behind just after we checked out and searched and found us near the ferry to return it to us!! Teriffic guy!\nThe restaurant is right on the beach and takes about 4 minutes of cycling to get to. Ben, the general manager was lovely and always ready for a chat or to give some advice, the rest of the staff was very helpful too.\nBreakfast was included with our stay, unfortunately it always seemed to be cold and not very much variety. The cafe latte we ordered extra was nice.\nBeing a guest with Scallywags entitles you to free beach lounges, right out the front of the restaurant in the sand. Apart from nearly being washed away due to an extremely high tide (which was fun anyway) it is a lovely place to spend some or all of your day.",

              "text": "This hotel is located in the village area, which is really quaint and lovely. The rooms are nice with very comfortable beds and all the amenities you could want. There is a little enclosed garden with a locking gate. I liked the fact they had a good selection of drinks in the mini bar and also provided Berocca (Gili Air is pretty fun so you may need it) insect repellent and a torch to find your way around at night. The pool was small and smelled heavily chlorinated, I didn't swim as I was out and about most of the time. The restaurant is located 10 mins walk or 3 mins bike ride away from the hotel, which didn't bother me. I ate breakfast and it wasn't bad. I didn't have any other meals or drinks, as I found cheaper more fun places to hang out. I booked last minute and got a pretty good price on the room. The Mosque rings at 4.15am every morning and for me that was difficult. I actually liked the other quieter side of the island better and would probably stay over there next time. If you are looking for a pretty upmarket hotel on Gili Air then this is the one for you. Just be warned about the touts at Bansal Harbour in Lombok they are rip off merchants and a bit intimidating. Lastly Gili Air really sucks you in and you may never want to leave...",

We need to walk for 8-10 minutes to have breakfast at Scallways Beach Club. That was ok for us. The room was clean and new. The staff in the hotel was average. At the dinner time, we found a shop \"Classico Italiano\" to have dinner. \nThe food in that shop was good and we didn't need to walk to the main road. We spent the time on the beach in afternoon time. It was very hot in Gili Air. We need to take 2 shower per day. The room provide hot water for shower.",

The rooms were clean and large, great aircon for the warmer days and the pool was just perfect to dip in! as there are only a few rooms here nothing was ever crowded and we felt like we had it all to ourselves.\n\nThe staff were very helpful and polite both at the resort and the restaurant. The buffet breakfast  was perfect !! The freshly cooked banana pancakes are a must have!! it was located a 10 min walk from the rooms though easy to get to and nice for a morning walk.\n\nOnce in the room it was lovely and quiet never heard the mosque or the parties that happen over the other side of the island.\n\nCant wait to head back and stay again !! This time for MUCH MUCH LONGER !! \n\nKeep up the good work guys !!",

              "text": "Great little hotel tucked in the village behind the pier - 5 min walk. Smart modern rooms, helpful staff, great bathrooms, small but perfect pool, bike hire and Classico - the BEST pizza joint on the island (if not Bali) a minute away. We squeezed a family of 4 (2 small kids) into our room and it was fine. No communal areas accept round the pool though you have a small patio outside your room. Hire bikes as the sister restaurant for breakfast is a hot 10 minute walk away. The manageress of the restaurant and hotel Annie was a star, really helpful (got us a reliable babysittter one night), and the breakast buffet (and all the food) there is great. Highly recommended and excellent value. You'll struggle to find better on Air.",

The rooms consisted of a little courtyard with a terrace to sit out, a clean comfortable compact bedroom and a lovely outdoor bathroom. All with complete privacy. There is a small pool in this complex with sun beds and I had this to myself giving me peace and quiet away from the hubbub of the beach.\nThe rooms are located in the middle of a village with a mosque near by and it's necessary to walk 10-15 mins  to the main restaurant of Scallywags for breakfast. To me, in the morning, it was a pleasure to stroll up for food. Once there, a good buffet breakfast is on hand and as a guest of the hotel a free sunbed  is available on the beach with umbrella and towel. Food and drinks can be purchased throughout the day. \nStaff at both the rooms and restaurant could not be more helpful and friendly, and went out of their way to assist me. A special thank you to Annabel and Ben (managers) who gave me lots of advice and assistance especially on my iPad! They were a delight to meet.\nWould definitely recommend this hotel which combines professional and friendly on this pretty little island.",

What you don't have 7 minutes to spare whilst you're on holiday to take a stroll to the beautiful beachfront restaurant? \nThe staff were amazing both at the hotel and beach resort and at the restaurant it was the BEST STEAK I've ever had! honestly it was cooked to perfection from the BBQ. The pool is only a spa pool but if you want a swim get down to the beach. The pool area is very relaxing as well but only room for about 6 people to chill out. No bar in sight though but a very well stocked up minibar. It's a great stay!",

Off side streets of the village and in Gili Air, you really want to be by the water. \n\nLoved the outdoor shower and not a critter in site! Good breakfast but that's down at the restaurant, 5-10 minutes walk away, not really a problem for me but it might be for some. \n\nAlso you can hear the mosque at 5am.

It's a little bit tucked away and about a 5 minute walk to the beach and Scallywags restaurant but we just got organised to bring our beach gear when we went to breakfast and then once there we didn't move! There's a little pool but honestly we didn't use it the beach was just so nice. The rooms have all the mod cons and a bonus DVD player so that when it rained in the afternoons we could chill out and watch a movie! The staff are exceptional both here and at their restaurant. Overall I would completely recommend scallywags Smugglers. Oh and a good tip is to book via their website, they had an awesome deal on when we booked.",

Theres a lovely pool which we had to ourselves as there was hardly any guests when we were here. Staff are friendly and when we moved to the scallywag motel down the road to save a little money they offered to carry our bags down for us. Buffet breakfast is varied and really nice. Another bonus is the DVD player in the room and the choice of modern DVDs to borrow from reception. Would definitely stay again. It's not on the main beachfront strip but a nice walk through the village will lead you there.",

Newly decorated + the bathroom was really cool - open air and had a tree growing in it!\n\nA stay here included use of the beach loungers (which saves you 50k each!) - this is great as its probably one of the best bits of beach on the island. \n\nThe included breakfast buffet was good, lots of selection + eggs cooked to order. \n\nOnly downside was that on one of the nights we were there the bar next door decided to have a beach party until the early hours, which was pretty loud in the room. But this was just 1 night.\n\nWould definitely recommend a stay here - but please note this review relates to the 1 room they have next to the restaurant & is separate from the other rooms.",

This isn't much of problem, but you won't to be  going back and forth to your room several times a day - you become good at planning and bringing what you need for the day once you leave your room!\n\nWould definitely stay again.",

Clean beach, sun beds, awesome food (we ended up having breakfast lunch and dinner here after trying a few paces around, this was the best!).\nwill stay here if i ever go back again!",

The room was spotless and modern and the outdoor shower was great, also great aircon and well stocked mini bar. But there were no windows in the room except out to the little patio giving it a hemmed in feeling. The pool area was ok but the pool itself is too small to swim in. See separate review for restaurant which was underwhelming. \n\nGili Air in general not what we expected. Busy, over touristy, dusty and lots of rubbish on the beach. Development happening everywhere you go. Not relaxing.",

The rooms were stunning with great air con and the beautiful outdoor bathroom was a treat! The hotel is about a 10-15 minute walk to the Scallywags Beach Club but it's a very easy walk and if you rent bikes it only takes a few minutes (it costs about Rp. 40,000 per day per bike, and definitely worth it). If you want peace and quiet, it's very relaxing to just lay on a lounge and soak up the sun by their beautiful pool.\n\nBreakfast is included at the Beach Resort and there are a lots of different options... pancakes, eggs, bacon, mushrooms, tomato, sausage, fruit... all which were delicious!\n\nOverall, this was a great hotel to stay at and if you are visiting Gili Air, we would definitely recommend it!",

Anyway we felt homy and comfortable with the surrounding hotel.\n\nThe hotel staff helped us with renting bikes so it was easy for us to go to east and west beach. \n\nHotel has genset just in case the power is off, as it happened quite often in Gili Air\n\nThe manager , Myra, was very friendly and had a personal taste of handling guest. She even gave us a handshake when we left Gili Air using Scallywags boat. ",

The team here and at the beach club are friendly, helpful and most of all fun.\n\nThe rooms themselves are clean, comfortable and very private- great aircon and brilliant amenities, easily some of the best on the islands. The beach is a couple of minutes walk away which gives the rooms the privacy that a lot of the rooms right on the beach don't have - the beaches are all public here!!\n\nI will return here, it's the perfect place to chill out and relax whilst also having loads of activities available if you want them! Thanks to all of the team for making sure I had such a great time.",

This time it was terrible. \n\nWe arrived at the reception were there was nobody, after texting them someone came. No warm greetings, no welcome drink, not even asking how our trip was. Not how we are used to being greeted in Bali. \n\nWe were the only occupied room in the hotel, the room itself was ok, but not very clean.\n\nWe went to the pool and within 30 minutes we were bitten by insects. Also the pool and the pool beds were dirty. Instead of staying 5 days as planned we left after 1 day. We complained at the reception but they just said take the complaints to the company were we booked the room. \n\nNot recommended\n\n",

When we arrived we realised it was very quiet and they actually had more rooms available so he moved into a room next door. The rooms were lovely, spacious and clean, but the walk down to where breakfast would be each morning was a little far (about 10 mins) We were then told that they had some beach villa available so we moved into a family beach villa. The beach villa's are a little bit smaller and seem a bit older, there wasn't a wardrobe to hang clothes so we hung them on the curtain rail, which wasn't ideal and the mosquito nets had a few holes and gaps, but the villas are closer to the beach and food! The thing that make this place so amazing is the staff and the food! We ended up eating here every night because the BBQ was SO GOOD! The staff were so helpful when we moved from smugglers to the villas, carried all our stuff for us and were constantly making us feel happy and comfortable. I would definitely recommend staying here if visiting Gili Air!",

              "text": "We had originally booked into the Mango retreat which is about 5minutes walk from the beach. Unfortunately this was shut due to damage after the recent earthquake. We were upgraded to one of their beach bungalows - absolutely amazing!\n\nThe beach bungalow was clean and had more outdoor space than indoor space.\n\nIt was lovely to have breakfast on the beach but this was a unique experience where you order off the menu but no one tells you how many dishes you can have and we weren't told you could have juice on our first morning. Breakfasts varied significantly, portions were massive on our first morning (also my birthday but no decor or any greetings from staff), the second morning the portions were tiny, we left hungry.\n\nThe sea was full of very sharp coral and was difficult to swim in. I can imagine that during peak season the sunbeds go very quickly, we were lucky to have a choice of beds first thing in the morning.\n\nOverall, nice hotel, great location, seems a bit hit and miss at breakfast.

              "text": "We booked this accommodation based on the reviews on trip advisor. The rooms are very nice behind a locked door lies a private veranda before you enter your room. It is quite a long walk to the beach club for breakfast. The staff are very helpful and I would have giving it a higher rating had it not been for the fact that there is zero possibility of a good nights sleep at this hotel. The rooms are very close to the mosque and customers should be made aware that on Gili Air it is not just a call to prayer it is the full prayer service blasted out so loud on the speakers that it distorts the sound. It lasts well over an hour, sometimes close to two and when the first prayer of the day is early morning it is not conducive to sleeping. It starts at 0440hrs and goes on until at least 0600hrs - the evening one is longer but not so much of a problem because of the timing. \nWhilst I understand the hotel can not control this it nevertheless effects the customer experience and therefore my review. I have travelled vastly and have been to other Islamic countries where the call to prayer ,although within the same timings , is a call to prayer alone but this is unbearable when you need to get at least a few hours sleep. A terrible shame as otherwise this would be a great hotel. ",

I booked the Superior Room (Rumah Dua), it has private terrace, private entrance, really the best choice for you who needs quiet moment.\nI chose this room because it's not a \"traditional\" type of room, instead it is more minimalist and modern. Room is cold and have good air circulation -- which is perfect for a cool down after being sweaty outside.\nBreakfast is well-made western and local food, tasted awesome especially the sausage. They also have bicycle rent service, with a bigger and thicker tire which make it easier to paddle on sandy road. \nOverall, it's 8.5 / 10. It's indeed not located by the beach, but at the same time it's a perfect place to hideaway.",

We had a nice private patio, huge bed, spacious bathroom and a very powerful air conditioner. Staff was really kind and helpful. We got breakfast included in our stay, but perhaps skip it. The breakfast location is beautiful -- just a short walk to their diving property with tables in the sand, but the food was just ok. Might be better off grabbing breakfast on your own elsewhere.",

There was even a phone provided so we could call them if necessary!  We had some problems initially with the wifi connection but each time we called, someone was there within minutes to try and rectify the problem.  The villa is very private with a small, lovely pool and the rooms are simply but nicely decorated.  Since the breakfast buffet was quite a walk from the villa, room service delivered our breakfast (which was very good) each morning.  A great addition would have been to have a microwave in the kitchen.  If we are lucky enough to visit Gili Air again, this villa would be our first choice for accommodation!",

Pool is small but looked nice, we didn\u2019t really use it as we were too busy exploring the beaches. Located a short stroll from the harbour down an alleyway, which suited us as it was quiet :) Staff are lovely and  friendly and super helpful. Room also has a private balcony/garden which was awesome. \n \nYou have to walk or cycle (you can rent bikes from the hotel for 50,000 rupiah per day, yes they have seen better days but they do the job!) to breakfast, but it wasn\u2019t a big issue for us. Food at breakfast was okay, the pancakes were a winner! Coffee also not bad :)\n\nFor the price we paid it was excellent value. Would definitely recommend for anyone travelling to Gili air!  My only issue was the cidomos (horse and cart) by the ferry harbour.  The poor horses looked completely exhausted and dehydrated. If you are an animal lover it can be hard to see, it actually put a dampener on the trip for me, but obviously no fault of the hotels!",

Fortunately, we are involved with the local eco trust on the Gili islands, where we strive to help provide the best living conditions and standards of care for these horses as possible while still understanding that the locals rely on the horses for income and that they are a tradition handed down through generations.\n\nTake care for now and we hope to see you back soon.\n\nBest Regards,\nLexy",

              "text": "I enjoyed my stay here. It was just what I wanted for a few days of peace and quiet while traveling around Indonesia. First off, I chose this location because it is a short walk from the ferry port which was crucial as I did not want to haul my luggage a long way, but also did not want to use a cidomo. I took the public ferry from Bangsal and arriving here was a breeze. \n\nThis is a small property tucked away on a side street. It was peaceful and quiet. I often had the pool to myself! Yes, you will hear the call to prayer from the island's mosques at ~4am every day, but this is part of being on the Gilis and it makes the experience unique. I have read reviews of various properties complaining about this, but I think that no matter where you stay on the island you will hear it because there are loud speakers everywhere. \n\nThe room I had was immaculately clean with powerful AC and fairly reliable WiFi. I loved the outdoor rain shower. There are also books/DVD's at reception for some evening entertainment if you don't feel like going out. \n\nThe breakfast buffet was quite good. Yes it is not on site and you have to walk 10 minutes to the beach, but this is not an island where you should be rushing from one place to another, so it was fine for me. The beach club was great with towels, lounge chairs, great drinks/snacks. Just next to the hotel, there is an Italian restaurant which I did not get a chance to try but it looked very nice. There's also a little warung \"Firda\" which is cheap and good for a simple lunch (actually their WiFi was the fastest I found on the island). \n\nThis is a great place to stay on the island and suitable for solo travellers, couples, and families alike. They really cater to everyone.",

My single room was perfect, finally a t.v. \ud83e\udd17 & bathroom toiletries at hand. The pool is small but perfect after a whole day out in the ocean.My favorite part was the pool, intimate, well sheltered but not too much & just oh serene... Beautiful doesn't even begin to describe it, magnifique, that's the word.Good WiFi which is hard to find in Gili Air (trust me) & a hot shower; now this is a gem in Indonesia let alone Gili Air....Breakfast is taken on the other side of the island (15minutes walk) it's a satisfying mix of both Western and Indonesian food.The staff are ever so polite &eager to help. Thanks to Scallywags, you can make merry without worrying about anything & enjoy your vacation.",

Best welcome drink ever! The staff were very welcoming and friendly especially to the baby in our party. Each room is totally private with a veranda and open air shower. You have to walk 10 minutes to the breakfast but Gili air is beautiful so we didn't mind. There was a great selection for breakfast, I recommend the sausages and granola. The staff at the beach club are also amazing. We took advantage of the free sunbeds on the beach. I will definatly be coming back. \n\n",

The rooms are lovely and very private with a small walled courtyard for each room opening out to a private clean pool with sun loungers - a great break from the beach!\nThe breakfast included is delicious especially the cooked to order pancakes, homemade granola and the thick sausages! The beach area, restaurant and staff are all amazing and really made our stay enjoyable.\nWe will be recommending this to all of our friends and we are already considering a return visit!\nThanks scallywags!",

The staff were nice and helpful - giving us a map and explaining where we can find sunrise/sunset etc. \n\nLocation: the hotel is a 15 minute walk to the restaurant which has breakfast and sunbeds, so you have to hire a bike which is 50,000rp per day. The main issue is that the cycle at night is dark and would be quite spooky if you were alone - it's very difficult to see and lots of potholes in the floor. There is a great Italian just 1 minute away called Classico Italiano which I recommend for their amazing oven-baked pizza. \n\nRoom: the room was clean and spacious, the mini-bar was amazing - fully stocked with lots of drinks, snacks and handy bits (e.g. mozzie repellent). Wifi was very temperamental but this is expected in the Gilis. \n\nRestaurant: the breakfast was fab - lots of variety. We also had lunch and dinner - it wasn't the cheapest of places but the food and service was great and right on the beach. Both my friend and I had Bali Belly immediately after our stay here, however we can't 100% say this was Smugglers fault... \n\nPool: we didn't sit by the pool as it was covered, looked alright though. \n\nOverall: really enjoyed our stay and I don't think much better could be found elsewhere on the Gilis",

Slightly more expensive for Indonesian prices, but we chose the BBQ option where we chose meat, fish, seafood, kebabs etc to BBQ on the grill with the bonus of as much as you could eat salad bar and the yummiest french bread. 2 for 1 cocktails were great value and so ginormous I could barely finish them! They packed a punch too!\nThe restaurant is located right on the beach and after the day's sunbathers relinquishing their sun lounges, the staff efficiently pack them away and set up tables and chairs on the sand with torches and candles glowing in a very romantic setting.

In the office Lalu was brilliant - even bursting into a great rendition of 'You'll never walk alone' upon learning my partner was a scouser. Mahrun in the restaurant was wonderful too, always greeted us with a smile. The only downside was the distance between smugglers and the beach bar where you have breakfast and can use the sun loungers. In the end I rather enjoyed the stroll over but would've been nice to know it's a good 10/15 walk in advance of booking. All in all had a fabulous time and value for money was next to none. We can't wait to come back. ",

He greeted me and made me feel welcomed, like long awaited family member finally returning home!  Without being salesman to make me feel pressure, instead it was his pleasure to provide me just enough information about the various activities on the islands, including Snorkeling Trips, Komodo adventure, Lombok Tours, Rinjani Trekking, SPA in Scallywags Trawangan and the transportation to Lombok by Scally private car and fast boat to Bali by Bluewater Express.  The most exciting and unexpected part of Bahar's hospitality, however, was that he even arranged a short term opportunity for me to go and volunteer teaching English for a few days in a school back in his home village of East Lombok.  I would never have experienced this opportunity if not for Bahar going above and beyond just checking me into the hotel. Hopefully, I will have a friend for life and look forward to visiting Gili Air again!   If you go here, definitely ask to see Bahar and ask him about Volunteer opportunities.",

It looks like he went the extra yard to keep a guest happy, and above all make a friend. The photos are fantastic. \n\nBahar is a jewel in our crown. Its comments like this that make this whole trip advisor thing worth while, rather than doom and gloom with no outcome.\n\nI have noted your details, and I will make sure the next time you're back in town we will look after you, I know Bahar will be pleased if you do.\n\nFrom me, and all of us at Scallywags, and Bahar, thank you Michael, and we look forward to seeing you back on Gili Air soonest.\n\nKind regards.\n\nIan ( assistant manager )",

Clean and comfy bedding. Did the job for my solo travel. Helped to organise my onward transfer to Scallywags on Gili T by complimentary speedboat. \n\nBreakfast buffet included is amazing - beautiful homemade food and great cook to order stations. \n\nAmazing beachfront with really comfy loungers and an incredible view of Lombok. \n\nWould 100% return.",

The villa was a reasonable walk from the  main strip near the harbour (although the main office/reception is a bit tricky to find) \n\nThe villa itself is amazing and very clean and the staff were friendly and attentive. It was my birthday during our stay and they really went out of their way to make it special and memorable - when we went to dinner the staff sang happy bday and i got a lovely cake - so thank you guys.\n\nYou can get food delivered to the villa if you dont want to go to the restaurant for breakfast and they give you a phone connecting you to someone who can help.we lost our fastboat tickets back to bali and the manager spent a couple of hours and went to great lengths to try and help us. We were really amazed because they was well beyond their job role but we really appreciated it.\n\nI will 100% be back to stay with you guys and would reccomend to anyone travelling to Gili Air ",

Great breakie at the beachside restaurant along with access to beach lounges/umbrellas and towels. We moved to Joglo villa for 2 nights and loved the 3 bedroom villa! with no fault of Scallywags I will say that to be so close to the mosque and hearing the loud prayers and chanting from 5pm till around 8pm and then it starts up again at 4.30am for an hour or so was a little distracting when you are trying to have a conversation or gathering in the villa....we had to head down to the beach so not to hear it ... bring ear plugs :). We also found it a little strange that staff wanted to enter our villa at 9pmish to check our pool???  Overall though great place to stay!",

Unfortunately during our whole stay the pool was not in working order (closed for maintenance), we didn't research how far away we would be from restaurant & beach, staff on arrival also didn't provide these important details & next time we will definitely be choosing to stay on beach. Another miss on our research was its proximity to the local mosque which broadcasts using a very loud PA system starting at 4.30am. \nOur room was clean & a good size. Nice outdoor bathroom & a well stocked mini bar. \nGili Air a lovely island to see & stay on but I would advise doing your research...if you want a quiet location, beach front, look around East/north side - bikes best for getting around island. \n",

Most of our guests enjoy the location amongst the local villages and the leisurely stroll to the beach, however i guess it was not for you.  The Mosque is a part of the local culture that makes the Gili's and Lombok so special, the call to prayer can be heard across the Island, so unfortunately this is something we need to accept and indeed embrace.\n\nWe have passed on your feedback to our team regarding better communications regarding location etc.\n\nRegards\nAmanda",

The first decent green tea since I arrived in Bali! And hash browns! \nRight outside the restaurant for breakfast you could use their sun loungers too, on a really great part of the beach.\nAll staff were so friendly and helpful.\nHighly recommend this place!",

I just ordered the ribs and sat down but it was a very boney end cut which did not resemble 'ribs'. Our beef skewers were all very very cooked- note to r restaurant. The meal comes with baked potato, rice or fries. I had the potato which was very nice. New selection of salad and nice drinks menus. For the two of us with two drinks cost 15 pounds sterling. ",

              "text": "The description gave me the impression we were on the beach but this is not the case.however, breakfast is served in the beach club...quite a long way from the bungalows. We rented bikes to get back and forth but in hindsight these should really be complimentary due to the location of the accommodation. The bungalows were in the centre of the island, next to a mosque...so we woke every morning at 5am with 'call to prayer'. Staff were very courteous reception especially helpful. The meal at the beach club on our first night was a disaster. We went for the BBQ deal, i ordered a steak (rare) my son ordered ribs. After an hour's wait for food, My steak arrived cold and my son's ribs were totally overcooked, tough and impossible to eat. When my food came i ordered a bottle of red wine to have with it, checking i could take whatever i didn't drink wth me when leaving. Eventually a glass of wine arrived, when my dinner as already finished. I hadn't the will left to complain at that stage. For the prices the beach club charges in comparison to other places, this is really unacceptable. Pool is small but nice, pool area also really small...not suitable for spending much time. As I said the room itself was lovely, equipped with all travellers needs, the bathroom also. only problem was the leaking airconditioner that i only noticed once i'd left my bag on the unit underneath. :(",

Comfortable bed and have lots of dvd to rent so you could snuggle in the bed all day if you don't feel like sunbathing by the beach. Must rent their bicycles, they are the best in the island. We tried Discovery Scuba Diving with their diving team too.. very professional and we managed to see turtles! Only downside is the hotel is situated near to a mosque, but only during sunset time that it affected us a little. \nNevertheless, still truly enjoyed our stay here, highly recommended!",

              "text": "Scalleywags is the only hotel in three weeks of travel in both Bali and the Gili islands that I found a sad, overpriced disappointment.  For half the price one can get a room at over a dozen small hotels right on the water with a view, ocean breezes  and a pool.  \n\nScalleywags is located in a hot, dirty, airless neighborhood five blocks from the water and eight blocks from their advertised 'beach club'.  Although I requested a single at booking I was charged for the full price of a double ( staff saying that was all they had)  including the charge for two breakfasts each day without any deduction or other option and yet when it came to providing water,  welcome juice voucher, or towels they gave me only enough for one.  Even then I had to to ask for water!  \n\nAt Scallywags Beach Club on Gili Air,  I watched workers carefully rake the beach and then spend half an hour tossing the garbage collected (including 5 gallon gas cans and large plastic bundles) into the sea.  I asked why they would do this.  A staff member said that the place next door throws it in and it washes up on their beach so they are just moving it down the beach with the currents!    If the Gilis are to survive as a desirable destination, more than anything, the Gilis need to develop and implement a waste management plan.  Garbage is everywhere on land, beaches and the sea.  I walked over it, swam through it and saw it burning in piles including plastics polluting the once pristine air.  Tourists create it and workers,  who are imported from Lombok, don't care- it is not their home.  This once pristine, isolated and beautiful corner of the planet is now drowning in garbage on the land and the sea.\n\nAvoid Scalleywags hotels and beach club- find a place along the water with breezes and views without the overcharging and blatant garbage tossing.  I do not know how they got their rating.  It was not at all accurate.  The room was clean and air conditioning worked- that is all I can say for it.\n\nBetter yet- stay in Bali.  The water is cleaner and the people take pride in their homes, businesses and communities.",

The only thing to bear in mind is that rooms are a bit far away from the beach, like 10 mins walk, so renting bikes is recommended. The beach is very nice, the staff will provide everything. It's not super nice that lots of boats stop in front of the beach from 11 am on, though. \nWe had a very nice stay and would totally come back at Scallywags.\n\n",

Don't be concerned that it is a short walk (Less than 10 Min!) away from the main area in Gili Air - this is what makes it great.  You walk through the local village and houses giving a very local experience - excellent during Raya!  The rooms is nice and comfortable and quiet!  While the rooms are close by you feel like you are in your own bungalow. Air conditioning was great and staff was very helpful going out of their way to make sure I had transportation back to Lombok when taxis weren't available.  Thanks for making the stay fantastic.  Breakfast and dinner at the main restaurant a short walk away is also very excellent - service, quality and price",

Inside the walls was a beautiful pool, always to ourselves. Even though the rooms are all close together it has been made to feel like you're the only ones there with private front garden. The outdoor bathrooms were very clean, rooms also. Fab mini bar & large selection of movie channels for quiet nights in. The beach club was fantastic. A 10minute cycle away, the breakfast and coffee were brilliant. We ended up eating here most nights too as the staff knew us and the food was outstanding!\nHighly recommended to our friends and family.\nMuch preferred Gili Air to Trawangan too.",

The Smugglers is the budget option of Scallywags accommodation but you definitely don't miss out. For the same price as places on the water front (with less value for money) whoever planned these rooms really thought of everything...including berocca!!!\nUnfortunately we didn't find this place until the last few days of our stay on Gili Air but considering our experience the first time we will no doubt stay here again the next time we're back on the island.

Rooms have no view whatsoever. We had a room very close to the machine room which was very noisy but with the door closed we couldn't hear anything; it was one of the quietest rooms we ever had.  We had a great night's sleep and would definitely go back.",

As we went to smugglers we thought it seemed out of the way, but it wasn't far away from shops and cafes. \n\nIt truly was a hidden paradise, and it feels like you have your own little private villa. We were some of the only people staying at the place at this time, which made our stay even more relaxing! \n\nThe service was excellent, you get two bottles of water each day, and they can help you arrange great trips. Anything - they will be happy to help, and you can always find them.\n\nIn the room there are robes, a safety box, hairdryer, tv, minibar (with everything!) AND dvd player! (Which was great, they also have a bunch of great new dvds you can borrow.) The rooms also had great aircon. The room wasn't made out of bamboo which meant NO bugs or animals!  \n\nThe pool area, was very relaxing, comfortable new sun beds with large pool towels, and a lovely small pool.  \n\nThe Scallywags restaurant offered great buffet breakfast with both Indonesian and Western choices. \n\nPros: \n- It's in a peaceful, and quiet area. \n- Large room, with nice private terrace, and outdoor spacious bathroom. \n- Fresh water from shower, tap and in pool (not common on the island) \n- Net/shade over the pool area\n- Free use of Scallywags beach sunbeds \n- There is umbrellas and a torch (Good for the rainy season, and torch is good at night)\n- Superb wifi in room and at the pool area\n\nCons: \n- Not straight out to the beach, but only 7 minute walk to the beach \n\nWe had a very good stay here, and will without a doubt stay again if we come back one day!",

Smugglers Hideaway is our newest resort & as you say not far from the beach. If that the only con you had about us is that it's not actually on the beach then we are happy we made you happy. Please come back again.\r\n\r\nSee you next time.\r\n\r\nThe Team at Scallywags Smugglers Hideaway",

The bathroom is great and I love the dark stonework. The shower drain did have issues but this was seriously minor. The pool was divine after a day of diving because of the sun shade it was always cool. We often felt we had our own private plunge pool because not many seemed to use the pool, which was a fabulous treat for us! The staff are amazing and go out of their way to make sure your stay is fabulous....and they are so good with kids....our son just loved them all and when it was time to leave he got very sad and was refusing to go. The walk to the restaurant is a nice stroll through the local village and we actually enjoyed it and got to know a few locals. We had a great time here.",

It is a bit of a walk from the beach through the village, so if you're staying with young children and want right next to the beach, Scallywags also has accommodation right next to their beachfront bar and restaurant, but for us, Smugglers was great. Just picked up some bikes for the three days so we could get around easily. After trying some of the other restaurants, we ended up going back to eat at Scallywags all the time, think it was the pick of the island. Smugglers accommodation was beautiful, clean and quiet. Recommend it!",

Mostly it hasn't bothered people to have a short 10 minute walk away from the restaurant & beachfront. It's actually very nice to meander through the village along the shaded walk ways. You have to remember your torch at night which the housekeeping staff leave in your room. Gili Air is an easy island to get around & hiring bicycles is a very good idea.\r\n\r\nThanks for trying the Scallywags Experience",

              "text": "Scallywags\nSono stata qui quattro notti ad Agosto, premettendo che il livello delle infrastrutture a Gili Air \u00e8 molto inferiore rispetto a quello di Gili Meno, ho scelto lo Scallywags perch\u00e9 sembrava offrire standard pi\u00f9 alti rispetto alla media.\nLa struttura \u00e8 situata vicino al porto e raggiungibile con una passeggiata di pochi minuti. Purtroppo non dispone di una vera reception, quando si arriva spesso \u00e8 chiusa e viene indicato un numero di telefono (non tutti hanno una SIM locale) e bisogna attendere che l'interessato arrivi tramite il passaparola dei locali. Le camere sono carine con un piccolo patio privato e dotate di aria condizionata, bello anche il bagno esterno comunque riparato con tettoia. La cosa piu grave, a mio avviso, risulta la mancanza di un telefono in camera nonch\u00e8 di personale alla reception, impossibile trovare qualcuno a cui rivolgersi in caso di bisogno. Le camere vengono rifatte alle 17.30 del pomeriggio, ovvero quando si vorrebbe rientrare dalla spiaggia per riposarsi.. La mattina del secondo giorno l'acqua delle docce non arrivava, quindi non ho potuto lavarmi. La colazione \u00e8 davvero mediocre ed \u00e8 servita nel ristorante sulla spiaggia, ad una decina di minuti a piedi dalle camere. Il beach Club \u00e8 situato su una delle spiagge pi\u00f9 belle dell'isola perch\u00e9 non risente del fenomeno delle maree, i lettini e gli ombrelloni per gli ospiti della struttura sono gratuiti. I prezzi del ristorante e del bar sulla spiaggia, tuttavia, sono molto pi\u00f9 elevati rispetto agli standard dell'isola. Infine, abbiamo dovuto pagare il noleggio delle biciclette anche se su Booking era indicato che erano gratuite per gli ospiti, pur facendolo presente al personale, siamo stati costretti a pagare 50k al giorno. Inoltre confermo la vicinanza alla moschea che trasmette la preghiera mediante potenti megafoni all'una di notte, alle 5.30 e alle 6.30 del mattino. In conclusione, considerato il prezzo e la mancanza totale di assistenza, mi sentirei di consigliare di affittare una villa con piscina pi\u00f9 vicina alla spiaggia, liberi di scegliere dove fare colazione ogni giorno..

Chaque chambre a sa propre terrasse priv\u00e9e et ombrag\u00e9e, les chambres sont tr\u00e8s grandes, propres et tr\u00e8s bien \u00e9quip\u00e9es. Salles de bains avec la douche ouverte sur l'ext\u00e9rieur. Le gros avantage de Scallywags c'est le restaurant et la plage priv\u00e9e qui est la plus belle du sud ouest de Gili Air. Le petit d\u00e9jeuner buffet est tr\u00e8s bien et, en tant que r\u00e9sident, vous avez droit \u00e0 un transat et une serviette chaque jour et c'est tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ciable. En revanche vivre dans le village n'a pas que des avantages : pas de vue sur mer \u00e9videmment et chambre sombre puisque tr\u00e8s prot\u00e9g\u00e9e... En ayant fait le tour de l'\u00eele, j'irais plut\u00f4t voir sur la c\u00f4te ouest o\u00f9 les plages sont magnifiques et plus sauvages. Mais attention \u00e7a construit de partout...",

Nota poco dolente: \u00e8 vero, il ristorante dista una pigra camminata di 10 minuti dalla struttura principale, ma \u00e8 direttamente all'unica spiaggia dell'isola che \u00e8 balneabile per tutto il giorno. Si mangia quasi direttamente sulla sabbia e per gli ositi di Scallywags sono riservati gli ombrelloni in prima fila. Tutte le consumazioni del giorni possono essere anche caricate direttamente sulla stanza. Ergo: anche se il ristorante fosse nella struttura principale, la strada per andare in spiaggia bisogna comunque fare.",

Nej, det finns s\u00e4kert m\u00e5nga liknande st\u00e4llen och s\u00e4kert mysigare ocks\u00e5 till samma pris. Det finns pool men den \u00e4r liten och har bara lite sol. Bungalowen \u00e4r ok. Vi bodde i nr 11 och hade en mysig terass d\u00e4r. \n\nBeachklubben ca 10 -15 min promenad fr\u00e5n hotellet har en fin strand med tillh\u00f6rande solstolar och det tyckte jag mycket om. Att ligga d\u00e4r och titta ut \u00f6ver hav och strand \u00e4r helt underbart. D\u00e4r \u00e4ter du ocks\u00e5 frukost och den \u00e4r ok. Bananpannkakorna smakar bra. Jag \u00e4r dock v\u00e4ldigt besviken p\u00e5 lunchen som inte var god och det var besv\u00e4rligt att \u00e4ndra i best\u00e4llningen. \n\nPersonalen \u00e4r hj\u00e4lpsam och trevlig. ",

J'esp\u00e8re que cette \u00eel\u00f4t ne perdra pas son \u00e2me.\nLe Scallywags Smuggler: personnel tr\u00e8s serviable et souriant, ma chambre DeLuxe pas immense mais confortable, d\u00e9co de bon go\u00fbt et de qualit\u00e9. Propre, bonne literie, minibar bien rempli, coffre-fort, clim, jardinet \u00e9l\u00e9gant et salle de douche semi-ouverte bien sympa.\nL'ensemble est vraiment agr\u00e9able et la petite piscine tr\u00e8s calme et connexe aux chambres constitue un havre dont l'agr\u00e9ment est appr\u00e9ciable.\nL'h\u00f4tel ne se situe pas en bord de plage. Il faudra rejoindre le restaurant et les transats qui s'y trouvent, \u00e0 quelques centaines de m\u00e8tres des chambres. Ce n'est pas d\u00e9plaisant du tout de s'y rendre de bon matin en 3 minutes avec le v\u00e9lo gracieusement mis \u00e0 disposition par l'h\u00f4tel.\nEn revanche, il ne serait pas honn\u00eate de l'omettre, les chambres sont proches de la mosqu\u00e9e de l'\u00eele. J'y \u00e9tais en p\u00e9riode de Ramadan et l'imam ne m'a pas \u00e9pargn\u00e9 la diffusion de ses pr\u00eaches sur hauts-parleurs, parfois \u00e0 4h du mat'... A dire vrai, je n'ai pas raffol\u00e9 mais cela fait partie de la culture Indon\u00e9sienne, nous sommes ici en terres musulmanes \u00e0 un jet de pierre de Lombok.\nLe petit d\u00e9jeuner est un buffet classique o\u00f9 vous trouverez ce qui convient \u00e0 votre app\u00e9tit du matin. Je n'ai pas go\u00fbt\u00e9 les autres repas.\nPar ailleurs, le club de plong\u00e9e de l'h\u00f4tel jouxte ce restaurant de plage. Pour vos plong\u00e9es, il y a, sur demande, la possibilit\u00e9 d'\u00eatre accompagn\u00e9 de Camille une charmante instructrice fran\u00e7aise (trilingue, Ang+Esp) que je recommande tout particuli\u00e8rement.\n\u00c9galement, une autre jeune et souriante Fran\u00e7aise (ou Belge ou Suisse, je ne sais pas exactement, et aussi au minimum tri ou quadrilingue) a en charge le staff de l'h\u00f4tel ce qui facilitera la vie des francophones.\nJe conclus sur un bon rapport qualit\u00e9 prix.\nPour ma part, j'ai eu un peu de mal \u00e0 quitter le Scallywags Smugglers.\nJ'y aurais bien prolong\u00e9 mon s\u00e9jour de quelques jours...",

Da pereza por la ma\u00f1ana tener que desplazarse hasta el Scallywags de la playa para desayunar, pero si te vas con todo ya preparado, es genial, porque enlazas el desayuno con una ma\u00f1ana genial en la playita! Tienen opci\u00f3n de tumbonas y sombrilla (que para los que se alojan es gratuito, al menos en temporada baja), y aunque para hacer snorkel hay que caminar un poco hacia arriba la playa (justo delante de su local ya no hay arrecife), no hay tanto paso de gente. Los desayunos est\u00e1n genial. Y adem\u00e1s disponen de un club de buceo gestionado por ellos, con el que hicimos una inmersi\u00f3n, y estuvo genial. La habitaci\u00f3n que nos dieron era muy c\u00f3moda, y grande. Y la zona de la piscina es preciosa, y muy tranquila.",

Vuelvo a insistir...pues estan en el interior de la isla a unos 15 minutos del beach club donde esta la playa y donde esta el restaurante para el desayuno.Pero el problema no es solo la distancia sino que esta junto a las casas donde vive la gente local,nada q decir de ellos,pero para acceder son callejones estrechos donde la limpieza brilla por su ausencia y que por la noche no est\u00e1n iluminados y necesitas una linterna para poder llegar,linterna q ya te proporciona el hotel.Ademas hay q a\u00f1adir que est\u00e1n junto a la mezquita de la isla y esto es un gran problema ya que al ponerse el sol empiezan sus rezos ,nada que decir,pero con un volumen exageradamente alto y distorsionado muy muy molestoso y el problema se magnifica cuando a las 4:45h de la madrugada al amanecer empiezan de nuevo los rezos con el mismo volumen exagerado y distorsionado que te despiertan y ya no puedes dormir porque duran rato pero mucho rato.Esto sucede tanto en el scallywags smuglers como en el mango retreat,tambi\u00e9n mal ubicado en el interior isla.\nOtra pega es el desayuno,aqu\u00ed el principal problema es la limpieza,es muy marranote todo adem\u00e1s de poco variado.\nComo positivo,sus trabajadores todos muy amables y simp\u00e1ticos y siempre para lo que necesites,un diez por ellos.\nEn resumen por el precio de este hotel tienes muchos en la isla mejor ubicados y mas tranquilos.\nMi consejo coger un hotel que este situado del puerto hacia el oeste,es la zona mas bonita y limpia,como hotel el Ombak se ve muy muy bien.El \u00fanico inconveniente de todos es que para ba\u00f1arte tienes que ir al beach club del scallywags ya que su playa es la mejor,pero es un paseito o tambi\u00e9n puedes coger una bici o un carro con caballo para que te lleve.Pero tendr\u00e1s como ventaja el hotel ,su piscina,habitaciones todo junto y mucho mas tranquilo y limpio.\nCreo que el hotel tendr\u00eda que informar de que las habitaciones y el resto del hotel estan en diferentes zonas.\nTambi\u00e9n estuve scallywags trawaguan,el hotel algo mejor pero la isla es una locura y la basura esta por todos lados,ademas de un caos horrible,peligro de q te atropellen los coches de caballos o las bicis,masificado al m\u00e1ximo.",

Dort hat man als Hotelgast auch gratis Liegen. Wir wurden dann zu Fuss abgeholt und marschierten durchs Dorf. Dass die drei Zimmer Villa nicht bei den anderen Hotelzimmern ist, hatte ich beim Buchen nicht realisiert. Es sind zwei Villen nebeneinander mitten unter den Einheimischen. Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck kann man entweder ins Haus bestellen oder vorne beim Beachclub einnehmen, sicher 10 Minuten zu Fuss entfernt. Das Haus ist gross, wir hatten auch gratis vier Fahrr\u00e4der. Waren nur eine Nacht, eine mehr w\u00e4re toll gewesen. Gili Air hat vorallem Touristen, die schon l\u00e4nger rumreisen.\n",

Eneste ulempe er at det ligger t\u00e6t p\u00e5 en moske og det larmer et par gange om dagen. Der er ca. 10 minutters gang til stranden og Scallywags Beach Club. En hyggelig g\u00e5tur. Og ellers kan du tage de cykler som h\u00f8re med til villaen, som ogs\u00e5 er gode til at cykle rundt p\u00e5 \u00f8en. De ansatte er meget venlige og de holder villaen fint ren hver dag.

Die Unterkunft liegt etwa 3 Gehminuten vom Pier entfernt. Der Weg dorthin war furchtbar, \u00fcberall liegt M\u00fcll herum und es sieht wirklich heruntergekommen aus - der einzige Nachteil an Gili air. Deshalb war es eine Riesen Erleichterung, als uns unser Raum gezeigt wurde, welcher nicht Standart ist sondern absolut super. Die R\u00e4ume sind allesamt in Privatbereichen, wir hatten eine kleine sch\u00f6ne \u00dcberdachte Holzterasse. Das Zimmer ist gro\u00df, toll eingerichtet, die Betten sind auch gro\u00df, bequem und es gibt viele Ablegefl\u00e4chen. Das Bad ist Outdoor, was ich erst ein wenig unangenehm fand weil ich mir um Insekten Sorgen machte, aber die wurden mir schnell genommen. Die ganze Unterkunft ist wirklich pingelig sauber. Wird t\u00e4glich gereinigt, auf Wunsch sogar 2 mal, was wir jetzt nicht n\u00f6tig fanden. Auch gibt es eine w\u00f6chentliche Mosquito-Vorbeugungsma\u00dfnahme was ich pers\u00f6nlich klasse finde, weil man von den Viechern dort echt nichts gemerkt hat. Zudem kann man in der Rezeption kostenlos Fahrr\u00e4der f\u00fcr den ganzen Aufenthalt leihen, die echt sch\u00f6n sind! Die S\u00e4ttel sind ein wenig unbequem, aber wen juckts. Der Pool ist \u00fcbrigens auch sehr gepflegt und sch\u00f6n. F\u00fcr \"Lazy days\" kann man sich in der Rezeption kostenlos gute Dvds und Zeitschriften ausleihen. Fand ich klasse. Zum Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck muss man allerdings ins Scallywags Beach Club, welches zu Fu\u00df ca 15 min von der Unterkunft entfernt ist. Mit dem Fahrrad war das aber kein Problem. Dort ist das Fr\u00fchst\u00fccksbuffet sehr lecker und man kann sich f\u00fcr den ganzen Tag bequeme liegen mit Sonnenschirm direkt am Strand kostenlos reservieren lassen. Ein weiterer Pluspunkt: nur wenige Minuten von der Unterkunft gibt es diesen strandabschnitt mit einer Mega Wasserschaukel und bequemen H\u00e4ngematten. \nDas einzige Manko ist das schlechte WLAN, aber das ist eben auf der ganzen Insel so. \n\nAlles in allem ein super preis leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis und mehr als \u00fcberzeugend!!",

              "text": "Wir waren vier N\u00e4chte im Scallywags Smugglers, welches im inneren der Insel liegt. Bei unserer Ankunft erhielten wir einen Gutschein \u00fcber ein Willkommensgetr\u00e4nk - Fanden wir nett. Das Hotel selbst ist sehr sch\u00f6n gemacht, saubere Zimmer, volle g\u00fcnstige Minibar, funktionierende AC, gem\u00fctlich gut riechende Betten und ein Bad im Aussenbereich. \n\nAm ersten Tag erhielten wir noch keine Fahrr\u00e4der, da alle bereits an G\u00e4ste \"vermietet\" waren. So mussten wir zu Fuss zum Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck im Beachclub laufen. Man sollte beachten, dass Gili Air eine ziemlich schmutzige Insel ist und viele der Bewohner in \u00e4rmlichen Behausungen wohnen und dort auch gerne mal ein bisschen M\u00fcll verbrennen. Wenn man da zu Fuss morgens zum Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck l\u00e4uft und erst an alldem vorbei muss, kann es einem schon den Appetit verderben. Daher meine Empfehlung: Gleich am ersten Tag auf die Fahrr\u00e4der bestehen - So wird es ja auch angepriesen. So f\u00e4hrt man schnell an allem vorbei.\n\nZum w\u00fcrde ich nicht den Weg am Hafen entlang Richtung Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck nehmen, sonder den durch das Inselinnere, denn direkt am Hafen ist es am schmutzigsten und es riecht gerne mal schlecht.\n\nDas Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck an sich kann man dann jedoch mit Meerblick geniessen. Auch die auf Wunsch gemachten und kostenlosen Eierspeisen und Pancakes runden das Buffet ab. Auch die kostenlose Liege und Handtuch an dem sch\u00f6nen Strandabschnitt sind ein dicker Pluspunkt!! Sehr zu empfehlen!\n\nGeh\u00f6rt eigentlich zum Beachclub:\nDie zwei Dinge, die mir nicht so gut gefallen haben: Speisen im Beachclub sind sehr teuer und ziemlich klein. Der Avocado Krabben Cocktail f\u00fcr 85k war winzig und hat zudem \u00fcberhaupt nicht geschmeckt. Zudem ist das Personal unfreundlich und arrogant. Meine Empfehlung: Mittags einfach wo anders essen, Getr\u00e4nke und Snacks mitbringen und lediglich die Liegen und die Handt\u00fccher nutzen. (Frische Cocosnuss 50k, gegen\u00fcber beim H\u00e4ndler ums Eck 20k)\n\nWenn man auf die o.g. Dinge acht gibt, kann man es im Smugglers eigentlich gut zwei Wochen aushalten!",

Vor allem wenn man von Gili Air zum Lombok Airport m\u00f6chte, kann ich den Scallywags Service nur empfehlen. Direkt vom Beachclub zu Beachclub mit dem Scallywags Boot und dort dann direkt in ein Taxi - so umgeht man die sehr aufdringlichen Taxis am Hafen mit Abzocker-Preisen. Wer fr\u00fch los muss, bekommt das Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck auch to-go. \n\nDas Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck gibts im 10-Gehminuten entfernten Beachclub. Dort sind auch Liegest\u00fchle mit Sonnenschirm und Badetuch f\u00fcr Scallywagsg\u00e4ste kostenlos reserviert, die man den ganzen Tag nutzen kann. Qualit\u00e4t und Preis-/Leistung f\u00fcr Speisen im Beachclub sind auch sehr gut.\n\nDie Leih-Fahrr\u00e4der sind alle recht neu und entsprechend gut in Schuss. Durch die breiteren Reifen auch gut f\u00fcr sandigere Abschnitte (und die gibt es zur gen\u00fcge ;) ) geeignet. Mit IDR 50.000 / Tag kein Schn\u00e4ppchen, aber durchaus lohnenswert.\n\nGenerell ist das Scallywags Smugglers nicht die preisg\u00fcnstigste Unterkunft auf Gili Air, aber das Gesamtpaket stimmt - deshalb gerne wieder!",

Ook erg fijn dat er een priv\u00e9terras zit bij de kamers. Zwembad is heerlijk om aan het einde van de dag nog even een paar baantjes in te kunnen trekken.\nHet ontbijt is prima, je moet er alleen we ongeveer 10 minuutjes voor lopen omdat het op een andere locatie is.\nSanitair is top (douchen in de openlucht \ud83d\ude0a) en het bed ligt erg goed. Goed gevulde minibar voor schappelijke prijzen.\nAl met al een toprestaurant!",

Pues, antes de ir a otro lado deber\u00edan pasar primero por aqu\u00ed. \n\nLa oficina queda como a 5 minutos caminando siguiendo la flecha. Cuando se llega ah\u00ed te atienden de maravilla sin importar cu\u00e1l es tu presupuesto. (Algo que no me pas\u00f3 cuando fui a otro lugar a preguntar) \n\nTienen habitaciones en distintos hoteles y precios. Yo voy a recomendar para quien vaya solo que pregunte por DIVE ROOM. Cuesta 150.000 rupias (12$ aprox) pero es lo mejor que vas a encontrar por este precio. \n\nTe dan una habitaci\u00f3n solo para vos con televisi\u00f3n y cable, Acc, edred\u00f3n y sabanas completamente limpias, los ba\u00f1os si bien son compartidos est\u00e1n siempre limpios y se comparten solo con 5 habitaciones m\u00e1s. \n\nTenes agua/refill para botellas gratis, te/cafe gratis 24/7.\n\nAdem\u00e1s en la habitaci\u00f3n Tenes una caja de seguridad como de los hoteles y el lugar tiene seguridad mediante c\u00e1maras. Gili Air no es inseguro pero a veces se pierde un par de zapatos que se deja fuera de la habitaci\u00f3n.\n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, me sent\u00ed como en un hotel 5 estrellas, adem\u00e1s que me atendieron de maravilla y me ayudaron a resolver unos problemas con mi ticket de regreso. \n\nSi bien esta habitaci\u00f3n est\u00e9 dentro del pueblito, est\u00e1 solo a minutos de la playa!!! Y se puede compartir m\u00e1s con la vida diaria de la isla.\n\nEl lugar es mejor de lo que se ve en las fotos.",

La vraie grosse valeur ajout\u00e9e en plus de tout \u00e7a, c'est le restaurant sur la plage ! Accessible en 10 petites minutes, vous b\u00e9n\u00e9ficierez d'un acc\u00e8s aux transats et vous y prendrez votre petit-d\u00e9jeuner. La cuisine y est excellente et le service vous tr\u00e8s soign\u00e9. \u00c0 noter que la playlist musicale est aussi tr\u00e8s bonne et vous permettra de chiller peinard au bord de l'eau. Prenez un masque et un tubas et aller admirer les poissons. Pour cela il vous faudra remonter la plage sur 100m par la gauche pour acc\u00e9der aux meilleurs spots d'observation. N'oubliez pas de prendre un peu de pain au restaurant pour attirer les poissons.",

Smugglers liegt zwar ca. 10 min zu Fu\u00df weg vom Beachclub (Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck), aber man gew\u00f6hnt sich daran. Das Meer/Strand am Beachclub ist traumhaft. Die Speisekarte ist lecker. Das Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck ist ein wenig monoton, aber ok. Der Service sowie fast alle auf der Insel super freundlich! Kommen gerne wieder, war eine wundersch\u00f6ne Woche. Boottransfer und Taxi vom Airport hat einwandfrei funktioniert. Danke!",

De kamer was goed, het ontbijt was ook prima, op 10 minuten lopen in de beach bar aan het strand. Een van de betere hotels op Gili. Handige bijkomstigheid is dat je als hotelgast een bedje op het strand krijgt. ",

Zimmer sind sehr sauber, gross genug und die Freiluft-Dusche himmlisch. \n\nHotel ist nahe den Hafen, so dass wir innerhalb von 5-10 min am hotel zu fuss waren. \n\nEs gibt s\u00fc\u00dfwasser, eine Mini bar mit fairen Preisen, Badem\u00e4ntel, Strandt\u00fccher alles was das Herz begehrt. \n\nIn der Nacht extrem ruhig. Hatten sehr gut geschlafen. \n\nDas Personal ist auch extrem freundlich. \n\nFr\u00fchst\u00fcck war sehr lecker. Pancakes empfehlenswert! Auch der 10 min weg dahin war unserer Meinung nach kein Problem, da man nach dem Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck gleich zu den Strandliegen gehen Konnte, wo man \u00fcbrigens auch frische neue Strandt\u00fccher bekommt. (nicht-hotel-G\u00e4ste m\u00fcssen f\u00fcr Liegen 50 000/Person zahlen). \n\nUns hat es so gut gefallen, das wir aus den geplanten 2 Tage Trip auf gili air einen 6 Tage Aufenthalt gemacht haben mit Transfer zu den etwas teureren aber daf\u00fcr gr\u00f6\u00dfer ausgestatteten (Bett, Bad, Pool) Mango Retreat. \n\nNoch ein Plus Punkt: unsere Koffer wurden zum anderen hotel vom Service r\u00fcbergetragen und auch bei der Abreise zum Hafen. \n\nPerfektes Hotel f\u00fcr einen perfekten Urlaub!

On m'avait dit que le confort \u00e9tait limit\u00e9 \u00e0 Gili Air mais vraiment aucun souci dans cet h\u00f4tel, aucune mauvaise surprise, il est parfait.",

On a pay\u00e9 nettement plus cher que pour tous nos h\u00f4tels et homestay de notre voyage mais \u00e7a vaut le coup!\nLa chambre est tr\u00e8s confortable, la salle de bain est super propre (et eau chaude non sal\u00e9e), le lit confortable, les draps tr\u00e8s propres et agr\u00e9ables, il y a une t\u00e9l\u00e9 avec pr\u00eats de dvd et l'air conditionn\u00e9 fonctionne tr\u00e8s bien et presque sans bruit, tr\u00e8s bien isol\u00e9 (on n'a pas entendu la mosqu\u00e9e \u00e0 5h du matin). La chambre donne sur un minuscule patio tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able. Pour ceux qui veulent un jardin \u00e0 la balinaise, sachez qu'il n'y en a pas (cela ne nous a pas d\u00e9rang\u00e9 du tout). Petite piscine tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able pour finir la journ\u00e9e... \nPour le petit d\u00e9jeuner, il faut marcher 10-15 minutes pour aller au bar de la plage. Mais \u00e7a permet d'arriver t\u00f4t et de profiter des transats mis \u00e0 disposition pour les guests de l'h\u00f4tel, sur une magnifique plage id\u00e9ale pour baignade et snorkelling. Le petit d\u00e9jeuner, sous forme de buffet, est excellent (il faut go\u00fbter au pancakes et il y a du pain avec beurre fran\u00e7ais!!!). Le Resto est aussi tr\u00e8s bon, quoique plus cher qu'ailleurs (mais \u00e7a reste tr\u00e8s raisonnable, surtout pour la qualit\u00e9). \nEnfin, le personnel, jeune, est tr\u00e8s gentil et serviable. Certains sont des \"trainee\", parlent moins bien anglais mais apprennent avec le sourire!\nBref allez dans cet h\u00f4tel si vous voulez faire comme nous et faire un cran au dessus sur Gili Air!",

Les chambres sont comme des petits appartements privatifs avec patio/terrasse et sale de bain ouverte sur l'ext\u00e9rieur, le r\u00eave. La literie est de tr\u00e8s bonne qualit\u00e9, la climatisation fonctionne parfaitement et n'est pas bruyante. Le personnel est adorable, vous pouvez emprunter gratuitement magazines et DVD \u00e0 la reception, l'id\u00e9al pour un apr\u00e8s-midi ou une soir\u00e9e d\u00e9tente. Le restaurant de plage est \u00e0 7min \u00e0 pied, mais on peut y rester toute la matin\u00e9e apr\u00e8s le petit-d\u00e9jeuner, et profiter des transats et de la plage. \nNous recommandons vivement cet hotel, le plus beau de notre voyage en Indon\u00e9sie!\n(nous y \u00e9tions fin ao\u00fbt 2015)",

Il a r\u00e9ussi a caser 10 grandes chambres, une piscine et une r\u00e9ception sur un minuscules parcelle enclav\u00e9e (hideaway) a 4mn de marche du port. Les photos n'ont rien de trompeuses. Bonne gestion australo-balinaise. Inconv\u00e9nient le petit d\u00e9jeuner se prend au restaurant de plage. Il faut marcher 6 mn pour le rejoindre. Mais le trajet est sympa. Gros plus on b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie de la r\u00e9servation a la journ\u00e9e de transat au Scallywags Beach Restaurant qui est situ\u00e9e sur une tr\u00e8s belle plage face a Lombok. Petit d\u00e9jeuner buffet tr\u00e8s correcte. Un quasi sans faute. \nA pr\u00e9ciser que le Mango et le Mango Retreat appartiennent au m\u00eame groupe. A \u00e9valuer aussi.. \nSi vous vous faites d\u00e9barquer en fastboat demander a d\u00e9barquer sur le pier sinon ils vous debarquent sur la plage du resto et les valises y roulent moins bien.  Quand on d\u00e9barque du port il faut prendre le chemin en face, apr\u00e8s les tatoueurs le sentier a gauche avec un(petit) panneau de l'h\u00f4tel. Suivre le sentier. La r\u00e9ception est a gauche un peu apr\u00e8s le restaurant Classico Italianno. \nBon s\u00e9jour... Noys ont s'en va :(",

Je zit erg dichtbij de aanlegplek van de boot vanaf Gili air (ong. 200 meter).\nHet restaurant om te ontbijten is echter wel een klein eindje lopen (ong 800 m). Het ontbijt bestaat uit een buffet en is erg lekker. Het Smugglers restaurant is ook een prima locatie om te dineren/lunchen, de mensen zijn erg hartelijk en willen alles voor je doen. \nOok zijn er strandbedjes beschikbaar voor klanten van het hotel. Ze raden echter aan om voor 10 uur te komen zodat je grote kans hebt op een bedje. Daarna wordt de kans kleiner, want komen er ook mensen van andere plekken om op de bedjes te liggen.",
