Tidur kami sekeluarga nyenyak dan rasa penat hilang seketika, Kamar kami di kelilingi pepohonan yang teduh, tupai melompat dari pohon ke pohon lainnya. Saya amat menyukai pilihan warna di kamar perpaduan perabot yang dipakai. Lampu dinding dan lampu meja amat selaras disusun. Sarapan pagi juga bervariasi, nasi goreng, mie goreng, lemper, cake roll amat disukai oleh anak anak kami. Hotel ini hanya mempunyai 14 kamar, hotel kecil sehingga perhatian dari staff benar benar sempurna. Jauh hiruk pikuk dari kota memang pilihan kami. Kami akan kembali ke hotel ini dengan service yang amat menyenangkan, staff ramah dan sopan. Anak anak kami menikmati bermain di kolam renang disuasana yang asri. Terima kasih Deli River untuk pelayanan dan suasana yg sempurna.",

Hotel ini amat nyaman karena jauh dari hiruk-pikuk lalu lintas. Di pagi hari kami menikmati suara kicauan burung dan di malam hari suasana tenang hanya suara daun-daun yang ditiup angin dari pepohonan disamping kamar kami. Desain dan perpaduan warna kamar membuat kami betah disini dan sinar lampu dari meja dan dinding membuat suasana  bertambah romantis. Staff di restaurant ramah dan flexible. Takkan kami lupakan kami berenang di kolam renang seolah olah kolam pribadi bunga kertas yang warna-warni, hibiscus, melati dan bunga ros, serta alamanda kuning membuat suasana di alam nan hijau menjadi sempurna. Terima kasih buat seluruh staff hotel Deli River kami akan kembali lagi ke hotel ini.",

Dari teras kamar, kami dapat mengikuti kegiatan tupai yang bergerak cepat dan gesit. Sangat menyenangkan buat anak-anak yang melihatnya. Suara kicauan burung silih berganti membuat pagi menjadi sungguh menyenangkan. Di pagi hari kami disambut dengan sapa dan senyum ramah oleh waiters dan sajian makan pagi yang enak dan bervariasi. Kolam berenang membentang di tengah alam yang  hijau dan bunga warna warni. Hotel ini berbeda dengan yang ada di tengah kota. Kamarnya yang masih bergaya tradisional sangatlah nyaman, meskit tidak mewah seperti kebanyakan hotel di tengah kota. Bagi pecinta alam dan ketenangan hotel ini sangatlah cocok.",

(Jumlah 6 orang)\nPelayan bernama elly sangat tidak ramah ketika istri saya tidak mau menambah extra bed dan extra breakfast. Karena menurut istri saya sangat wajar bila 1 kamar di isi oleh 2 tamu dewasa dan 1 anak usia di bawah 6 thn . Dan akhirnya pihak hotel bertoleransi untuk tidak menambahkan chas extra bed kepada kami .Dan untuk breakfast kami memilih untuk membicarakanya esok pagi\n\nKami di sediakan kamar di lantai 3 , seharusnya pihak hotel tidak memberikan kami kamar di lantai 3 melihat kami membawa anak anak , tetapi saya tidak mau mempermasahkannya dan menerima saja. Tentu saja tidak ada satu staff pun yg membantu membawa koper maupun barang bawaan kami. \n\nEsok pagi saat kami akan breakfast kami hanya 3 org dewasa dan 2 anak anak. Ibu saya tidak ikut breakfast melihat lokasi tempat breakfast menyulitkan dia karna harus turun dari lantai 3 dan berjalan sekitar 20 meter lagi.\n Sampainya di tempat breakfast seorang pegawai langsung menyambut kami, dia bertanya kami dari kamar brp?  Setelah kami memberitahu kamar kami , pelayan tersebut menyuruh dua org dari kami untuk breakfast di restoran ,sebab hanya 4 org yang mendapatkan free.sungguh mengagetkan dan hal yg memalukan buat saya. Pelayan tersebut bicara seperti itu tanpa melihat dahulu jumlah kami, seolah olah kami merasa seperti di usir dari tempat itu.\n\nSetelah saya bicara bahwa saya hanya datang dengan 3 org dewasa dan 2 anak anak baru pelayan tersebut mengerti.dan mengijinkan saya breakfast .dia hanya bilang  bahwa ia hanya di perintahkan oleh atasannya untuk mengatakan dan menginformasikan kepada saya. \n\nMenurut pendapat pribadi saya sepertinya pihak hotel takut kami tidak bisa membayar extra breakfast . Ini sangat menyinggung kami sekeluarga\n\nKami merasa seperti di awasi dan  oleh karyawan  di sana...mungkin karena kami bersitegang di awal mengenai masalah extra bed.\n\nSaya dan istri tidak sarapan sebab hilang selera kami . saya hanya menyuruh 2 anak serta pengasuh saya untuk makan secepatnya ... sebab ketidaknyaman pelayanan di sana kami segera bergegas pagi pagi  chek out dari hotel tersebut. \n \nSangat menyesal sudah membawa keluarga saya berlibur ke sana.",

Saya menolak, sebab breakfast masih besok pagi dan masi bisa diurus besok. \nSungguh pengalaman yang tidak menyenagkan... \nSaya tidak akan pernah kembali lagi ke hotel ini\nPercuma tempat yg baik bila pelayanan di awal sangat tidak menyenangkan..\nHanya kak rina yg saya liat selalu tersenyum dan sangat giat berkerja.",

Sebuah tempat yang sempurna jika Anda menginginkan ketenangan dan keheningan. Pegawainya sangat ramah, membantu dan menerima. Kami merasa seolah kami sedang berada di rumah. Kami menginap di sana selama 4 hari dan kami mengambil 2 kamar twin dengan pintu penghubung termasuk sarapan pagi hanya seharga USD544, masing-masing USD68 per kamar per malam. Restoran \"Omlandia\" menyajikan makanan yang lezat dan tidak perlu keluar dari resor untuk makan siang atau malam karena harganya tidak terlalu mahal. Ini adalah sebuah tempat yang tenang dan damai. Kami melapor masuk sekitar jam 9 pagi dan melapor keluar sekitar jam 2.30 siang tanpa biaya tambahan. Transportasi tidak bermasalah karena mereka memiliki anak perusahaan bernama Trijaya Travel dan Anda bisa mengatur keperluan untuk penjemputan dan wisata.",

Kami menelepon mereka dan dalam 24 jam kami menerima sebuah proposal yang detil berisi \"wisata-kenangan\" pribadi kami berdasarkan keinginan-keinginan yang kami kemukakan. \nPengaturan perjalanan kami, penjemputan di bandara dan penerimaan yang ramah di hotel merupakan permulaan dari sebuah liburan yang sempurna.\n\nMobil privat kami dikemudikan dengan baik oleh Dedy Suhaidi. Tidak sedetikpun kami merasa tidak nyaman saat diantar melalui lalu lintas khas Indonesia. Dedy menjadi pemandu pribadi kami, bahasa Inggrisnya lebih dari cukup, dia bahkan bisa sedikit bahasa Belanda, dan dia bertindak sebagai seorang juru bahasa dalam komunikasi kami dengan penduduk lokal. Dan yang paling penting, dia selalu bersikap rendah hati, santun dan ramah. Mobilnya dibersihkan setiap hari, bagian dalam dan luar.\nRekomendasi saya: mintalah untuk Dedy!!!",

Air conditioning, filtered water, tea coffee facilities.  The bathrooms as with all were tired but functional, no complaints.\n\nBreakfast is a buffet of fruit, bread and pastries and of course fried rice.  They will cook eggs to order and probably other things too.  Staff are very friendly and eager to help.  Lunch/dinner menu is good on both Asian and western food fronts.\n\nPool area is good for killing a few hours and there is a small zip wire and various hammocks in the grounds to keep kids amused.  \n\nIt is an 1/1.5hrs from the airport.  I have no idea what other closer options there are but if you are literally wanting a bed between flights there might be a closer option.  Otherwise all good.",

              "text": "I paid Rp.760.000 per night however Rp.350.000 seems the appropriate price based on the quality and lack of luxury. For pros: the grounds are kept quite clean and the pool is fantastic. The rooms are large and have lots of seating. For the cons: the 1 hammock isn't usable and needs to be replaced. No bottled water in the room, only boiled local water. It's 24.000 for a 1.5L bottle from the restaurant while it's only 5.500 outside the gate. The indo cuisine prices were way too high for the quality of establishment and the taste was bland. Luckily you can use go-jek to bring in tasty food from outside. The reviewers who mentioned the staff are rude were actually talking about a single employee. She is rude and insulting and you will run in to her all the time however she has absolutely no idea that she's offending anyone and my heart goes out to her because I saw her interacting with another guest and he was blowing her off the same way I was and I realized the poor girl has no idea why people are short with her. A tip for her: don't talk over your guests while they are talking to you, it is extremely condescending. You also don't always have to talk to the guests when you see them and you shouldn't comment on personal things they are doing. If a guest asks you something, they want conversation, don't interrupt them and try to send them away with instructions that are only based on the first couple words you heard before you cut them off. I honestly think she she's trying her best to act like a professional she saw on TV but instead is coming across rude.",

                     "text": " Honoured guest,\n\nThank you for your review. Concerning the price of our restaurant, we believe our food is reasonably priced. Pecel vegetable salad with peanut sauce and peanut crackers at Rp. 39.000 (around US$ 2.40) and spring rolls consisting of 2 pieces for Rp. 30.000 (US$ 2.20). A Nasi Goreng costs IDR 57.000 which is equivalent to US$ 4.50. This meal consists of Nasi Goreng with omelette, fried chicken, salad and krupuk (shrimp crackers), which is not overpriced at all. These prices are not expensive, we use fresh spices from our garden and all meals are freshly prepared. Almost all our guests praise the food and taste of the meals prepared by our kitchen staff. Concerning the drinking water in your room, we provide clean carbon filtered drinking water to our guests. This drinking water is of excellent quality. As we strive to reduce the use of plastics in our hotel we explicitly stated in our policy that we use re-fillable water bottles instead of plastic bottles as we are concerned about the environment. For the same reason we use solar tuff heating systems to provide warm water in our rooms as we all know that solar energy is environment friendly. The hammock in our garden you mentioned is still good, maybe it was placed too low but it can be used for those who like to relax in our garden. In our garden are at least 20 species of tropical birds which you can hear and see from your private terrace. Our comfortable airconditioned rooms are designed with utmost care and our rooms are fitted with unique classical Javanese hand made furniture which is very much appreciated by many guests as you can read in other comments. Last but no least we like to react on your comment about the attitude of our staff. You stayed 5 nights in our hotel and had only 1 time breakfast for the rest you did not communicate with our staff. We do not understand how  our staff could be impolite as there was almost no communication with you. Other guests did not complain about the attitude of our staff, on the contrary they praised our staff\u2019s hospitality, integrity and professionalism as you can read in countless previous comments. We are a small eco friendly family hotel and we strive to give excellent service. Management Hotel Deli River.",

              "text": "Situated a few kilometres outside Medan proper, this hotel is situated off a main road with a large lake as the centre piece and the administration and dining / reception areas in one place with accommodation in groups of 4 which are more like 2 storey homes than hotel rooms.\n\nThe rooms are spacious with large bathrooms and balconies off the room where one can sit and daydream or read with views of the lake in front. All are very tastefully furnished with very comfortable beds. At the time we stayed there the lotus flowers on the lake were starting to bloom and Dragon flys rested on the blooms - a nice effect!\n\nAll the staff we encountered during our stay were pleasant and helpful. Breakfasts provided in our tariff were brilliant, plentiful  with lots of variety. Evening meals are just the same.\n\nWe had a very restful few days there and swam in the hotel pool which was a pleasant place to relax.\n\nAnd the 3 ducks roaming about the property added to the experience!\n\nWill definitely visit there again",

The mgmt staff and owners were incredibly attentive to our needs, especially since my husband was recovering from illness. The fresh air, the green surroundings, the vast areas that could accommodate those with limited mobility were the perfect environment for my husband to exercise and perform physical therapy. We highly recommend this property for anyone looking for relaxation, getting away from the city, and to reconnect with nature. \n\nThe owners are Diana and Dirk, and it is very apparent that they pour their heart and soul into the resort. Their staff are very well trained and work seamlessly to ensure that the guests are content and satisfied. \n\nWe would definitely make a return trip, and bring along some family and friends to share our wonderful experience at Hotel Deli River.",

Such a little oasis for being close to the city. The setting was lovely, rooms were comfortable, food was excellent, pool was nice but the service was AMAZING! Elly was the most friendly and sweet person we came across in Indonesia! We LOVE their eco commitment - no straws, reducing single use plastic and have filtered water jugs in rooms instead of bottles. This is fantastic to see! Vegan friendly too and the options we had were delicious! Definitely recommend this place!",

Yep, my hubby and I love this place so much because this place make us feel at home, far from the crowded town, can relieve the stress from work.. The honeymoon suite room became our choice.. The swimming pool was clean with nice view of the Deli river. I think they upgraded the menu because now there are so many choices to eat.. I like the \"poffertjes\" and my hubby like \"beef and cheese sandwich\" which they made using their special homemade olive tapenade and tomato relish. It's so yummy. \ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\nAnd again even for the second time we had a wonderful and memorable stay at Deli River hotel.\n",

              "text": "Resort is located on the outskirts of medan and is an hour ride away from the airport. Took us a bit longer due to traffic. We had arranged a pick up from the resort. The driver was on time friendly and was careful. Though the rates very a tad higher we were ok with it. Rooms are clean comfortable and had a nice feel to it. The Air conditioning is insufficient and takes a while to cool the room. Since the climate was good we did not have issue. Some of the rooms have mosquito net over the beds but our room had not and we were asked to keep the doors closed to avoid mosquitos getting inside the room. To be safe we used skin cream against mosquito bites.\nThe swimming is clean and the view from the edge of it is nice. You can see a bit of deli river which at the moment is low on water people fishing and lots and lots of trees. Lunch and dinner was very good. All the food items are freshly prepared from locally sourced items. The cost may be a bit higher but since its organic we did not feel it expensive and the taste was great. The service was good and prompt but some of the waitresses did not have a good grasp of English but made their best efforts to explain all our questions. There are a few restaurants outside the hotel which serve local food and a fruit  market which is walkable distance but we did not try them. IMO the place is good and service is good and if I were to travel again I will pick them again. ",

Dinner, very good.\nOutside spaces and area; lovely pool, well kept garden, very quiet, nice to be away from the madness of Medan. We walked out of the hotel which I think was unusual as the local people definitely wanted to stop and talk to us. We did go to get some water (only complaint very expensive in the hotel). Great local knowledge and they really care about your trip, many thanks.",

The city of Medan is far from beautiful, hence why when needing somewhere to rest your head prior to heading off on the adventures of Bukit Lawang or further afield it's important to enjoy the sanctuary Deli River provides. Beacuase you can be sure that the next part of your journey will be long and arduous given Sumatra's roads. Rest and let the good people of Deli River take care of you.",

It has wonderful architecture inspired by the local culture and beautifully designed and kept grounds that make it a pleasure to be there. The bedrooms were tastefully charming, clean, and above all comfortable. The hotel is located a little outside the city, so it is best booked when you want to recover from jetlag and have no interest in the challenge of the city. \nThere is a large and pleasant swimming pool on the premises where you can spend happy hours but no attractions within walking distance. You can plan your North Sumatran journey from the hotel as they have plenty of information and nobody knows more about Medan than the owner who has written several books on it. \nDeli River is a getaway where you can rest, eat good food, and enjoy peace and serene quiet.The staff are excellent.",

The location was exactly what we wanted; away from hustle and bustle.  The restaurant served exceptionally delicious food and a wide range of it too.  Staff were more than just professionally competent and efficient, they were genuinely friendly and cared about giving guests the best experience possible.  The room itself was clean, spacious and attractive.  The prices (room and restaurant) were more than reasonable for the quality of the experience we had.  There were literally no negative aspects to our stay at Deli River and we are very grateful to all the staff for that.  I would recommend this place most highly.",

Getting my nephew out of the pool was difficult (well, getting us all out was, it's beautiful). The restaurant is good and the staff are well-trained and lovely. The grounds are great - you wouldn't know that you're in noisy, hot and grotty Medan! The trips organised by Tri Jaya tours here are also great - well organised, safe drivers, good value.

This is why staying at this beautiful \"green oasis\" only a short trip from the city center is so perfect. The rooms are also really comfortable and clean and on a hot day there is nothing better than going for a swim at the hotels pool. At the restaurant Omlandia they serve one of the best local traditional dishes we had on our trip to Indonesia and the thing we enjoyed the most was the included breakfast - so diverse! Everything was freshly prepared, even the bakery. Staff is very friendly. We would definetly stay there again! ",

              "text": "This place is a nice oasis from the hectic city and a good place to spend some downtime. Nice pool, little lake with ducks, playground, and each room has a nice balcony/deck where you can relax. The restaurant is good...their gado gado was my favorite dish of our trip. The restaurant closes at 9 and they shut up the whole place by 10, so it's not going to be a nightlife spot:-). It is outside of the city by a good bit on a small back road, so there's nothing within walking distance (other than convenience stores and local spots on the nearby road). Good sized room, comfy (good A/C!). They offer a nice breakfast with a good array of choices.\n\nThey also arranged our whole tour (TriJaya tours) and did a great job putting it all together. Our driver, Joel, was perfectly efficient and got us safely to and fro on the tough roads. They/he made the trip easy on us.\n\nUnfortunately, we had one negative experience that soured things quite a bit. I'm still giving this place a positive review because of their response and my overall impression. We had about $100 stolen from our room while we went on a city tour. This problem could be eliminated by providing safes in the room. We were hesitant to carry too much cash with us touring around Medan, so we went against our judgment (and their warnings that they weren't responsible for valuables left in the room) and left some cash in a compartment of a bag. Upon coming home that evening, my husband immediately noticed the zippers had been messed with and counted his money. We had 3 currencies with us, and a little bit was missing from each. \n\nThe hotel was extremely responsive and apologetic and the woman who had cleaned the room even came over late to go over what had happened that day. The hotelier, Diana, watched the many hours of CCTV to try to ascertain if someone else had gone into the room. I appreciate their diligence and understand that these things can happen (which they did warn us of), but of course it soured our stay so we spent our last night at a hotel in the city. I mainly share this to suggest 1. you take heed of their warning about cash/valuables 2. to suggest they offer safes so they don't have to deal with these issues (it sounds as if they have quite consistent staff and have some practices in place such as having the same person clean the room the whole time a guest is there, but a safe would be the best solution).",

We have taken the following steps to ensure that the valuables and belongings of our guests are safeguarded.\n\nFirst, we have dismissed the employee that was in charge of the maintenance of the room you were staying in. We dismissed her on the grounds that after watching 12 hours of CCTV footage we did not see anybody in the vicinity of your room besides her. Second, we are procuring safety boxes and will install them as soon as possible in all the rooms of Hotel Deli River.\n\nWe are extremely sorry that you have had to experience this and we would like to thank you for your feedback. Hotel Deli River is a small eco-friendly family hotel committed to promoting fairness, equality, women empowerment and ecological sustainability. We will work hard to always achieve our aims and we will step up our efforts to ensure that our guests have nothing but good experiences at Hotel Deli River.\n\n Kind Regards,\n\nManagement of Hotel Deli River\n",

Medan is a sprawling city noted more for being a gateway than a destination but this place is a good stopover. One negative is the very loud call to prayer (admittedly an external factor).",

The main house/restaurant in Indonesian style, very spacious and gave a feeling of grandeur of colonial times. Wonderful swimmingpool too.

              "text": "Hotel River Deli is the antidote to the hectic city vibe of Medan. When you arrive on property, you feel like you are on vacation. Bungalows are comfortable and air-conditioned with reliable internet. The staff is friendly and helpful. The owners Dirk and Diana are extremely knowledgeable about the history of Medan and can organize tours through their tour company, Trijaya. We did the Medan City Tour with a driver/guide named Dede, accompanied by Dirk\u2019s book, \u201cTours through Historical Medan.\u201d Dede was excellent and professional and tailored the tour to our interests. (For instance, we wanted to try the durian--\"stinky\"--fruit, so Dede took us to the outdoor restaurant where they serve and prepare durian.) The only challenge of being outside the city center of Medan is having to battle the traffic, which takes about an hour. If you have many errands to do in town, be prepared to have a commute, but if you\u2019re happy with a few days of relaxation on the property, Hotel River Deli is an ideal spot.",

              "text": "We have just spent New Year at the Deli River in a last minute three-night break from Singapore. It was our second trip to Sumatra, having been to lake Toba in '92 with our baby daughter. \nAnd we were not disappointed!! \n\nDirk and Diana couldn't have been more welcoming and Dirk even persuaded us to go on the Hash, hiking through the jungle, lots of muddy climbs and laughs. \n\nThe hotel is beautifully laid out and I spent a good while sketching from the balcony. The staff were ready to help and served us excellent meals - e.g. simple and delicious soto ayam, satay, gado gado and Dutch poffertjes (pancakes). They also cottoned onto the fact we like strong coffee and rolled out the espresso! \n\nWe took the Berastagi tour, spotted the volcano spitting lava and bought a stash of wonderful fruit. The drive to lake Toba was slow - we had been warned! - but definitely worth it for the fabulous view. So was the City Tour. We have visited many cities hereabouts and always enjoy the mix of old and new. Being a public holiday, there were plenty of people in Merdeka Square, playing drums and trumpets. Things I'll remember will be the lack of western tourists, and the friendliness of everyone we spoke to - even if they wanted a selfie with us. Our Bahasa is limited to a few words, but I'd love to learn more now. \n\nA few tips - hardened travelers won't need these - bring mozzie repellent, longlife milk (if you like milk in your tea or coffee), swimming costumes for the lovely pool, and earplugs if you don't want to hear the call to prayer and are a light sleeper. And leave behind your stress and tiredness. ",

The food - a mix of Dutch and Indonesian - was fresh and delicious  and the staff always explained about the ingredients. \n\nWe also thoroughly enjoyed the swimming pool. \n\nIf you are looking for an escape from Medan or somewhere at the start / end of your trip we would definitely recommend!

This well managed clean and well maintained hotel provided just that, it's beautiful within the chaos of Medan. Breakfast was great (although when we asked for milk with the coffee they brought some powder creamer, would expect more for this price) and they organised a breakfast box for us to take along to the airport. The restaurant does close quite early (21:00) for dinner so be sure to return early enough if you are to eat at the (rather pricey) restaurant. Thanks for  the nice stay and organising transport for us!",

We booked for 2 units of 2 rooms apartment with extra bed.\nOverall we have a good sleep but just need to highlight that only 1 unit of air conditional was available in 2 rooms apartment which we think the cool air did not fully covered the area.The hot shower would rather slow during the morning bath.However , this were just a minor issue for us.\n    Since all of our family member are the foodies, we recommence the banana juice which they serve as welcome drink to all...so refreshing and so healthy.\n   Don't forget to mention the staff and the owner there, there are all very polite thank them on their 5 stars hospitality and service.\n    The most memorial thing for me was their homemade buffet breakfast...everything was homemade included jam,bread,cake,fresh juice and their Oleh-oleh. Thumb up!\n  We have use their travel agency service to Berastagi, thanks to Pak Nasib, he brought us round the whole Kota to get the pharmacy and clinic since my Daughter was not feeling well during the trip. He is really a nice driver that we ever met. Terima Kasih!\n   Pls choose this hotel if you want to have a relaxing life in Medan trip, you will love it for sure!",

Everyone including the owners, the restaurant staff, the housekeeping staff, and the grounds people were fantastic!  My room was very clean, air conditioned, and very quiet.  The food was expertly prepared with good variety, both Indonesian and international.  Their water, from their own private well, is filtered multiple times and then they use it drink and to wash all the food. I know I'm using superlatives, but it's the only way I can describe how wonderful it was.  I sat by the pool every day - and jumped in every day too - and read almost a thousand pages in two great books.  A wonderful, relaxing, and warm place - both the weather and the people. If you are going the Medan, be sure to stay there.  You will love it like I did!",

              "text": "Hotel Deli River is a great place to stay. Away from the hustle and busle of the mertropolis Medan, you can relax here in comfort and luxury and plan new excursions.\nGreat care is taken by management and staff to cater for all your wishes. The food was delicious, swimming relaxing. But special mention deserves the way our Lake Toba trip was carried out by Trijaya, the organization that runs Hotel Deli River. Two weeks travelling around places that had once been familiar to me and my travelling companions with an experienced driver and guide was carried out smoothlessly. A great experience.\nNico v.d.Maas",

The next morning we woke up in a beautiful green Garden oasis and enjoyed the best breakfast in whole Sumatra. It is really delicious and everything freshly handmade. I truely recommend to stay here if you want to avoid or escape from Medan or want to relax. They have a nice pool als well.",

              "text": "I just returned from a 3 \u00bd week holiday in Indonesia (September 2016) and only stayed one night at this hotel, before starting my 3-week holiday in Indonesia. Seeing I already arrived at 8am from Singapore, the hotel arranged a city tour of Medan and except for a lovely driver/guide Joel, who also spoke Dutch, they provided me with a 64-page booklet on historical Medan, with loads of historical information and photos. A nice touch.\nI arrived about 13h at the hotel, a real peaceful oasis in hectic Medan and was met by the owner, Mr Dirk Buiskool. The hotel\u2019s travel desk \u2013 Tri Jaya \u2013 had made all the arrangements for my stay in Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi and Komodo. Everything was impeccably organised and nowhere I had any problems, really a 5* organisation. Very recommendable, they always took them less than 24h to respond to an e-mail whilst trying to organise my trip. Excellent service!\nThe hotel\u2019s gardens are lush, lovely swimming pool, the room spacious & comfortable, a large bathroom, nice terrace. Wi-Fi reception was excellent. Not a negative remark to be made. The staff are extremely friendly and attentive. Furthermore, they all speak English very well.\nI had dinner at the hotel\u2019s restaurant (called Omlandia), and the food was amongst the best I had in Indonesia and very reasonably priced. The next day\u2019s breakfast was perfect, something for everyone\u2019s taste. Do try the local fruit \u2018Rambutan\u2019, it is perhaps not looking appealing from the outside, but I found it to taste a bit like lychee, which I like very much.\nI short, I will definitely recommend, the Deli River Hotel in Medan and Tri Jaya. It\u2019s not a question of if, but when, I will visit Indonesia again. And I will definitely stay at this place again.",

We stayed here twice for two nights  (before and after our 8-day North Sumatra tour) which we could also book right away at Deli River (Tri Jaya Tours & Travel). The hotel is set in a wonderful garden, with a little playground and a good and big pool. We had a perfect family room, always decorated with fresh flowers. The staff was always really friendly and helpful and granted every wish! \n\nBreakfast tops it all - it is the best breakfast we've ever had in Asia with self-baked bread and cakes, Indonesian specialities, eggs and many different fruits, sometimes right out of the garden and freshly made fruit juices. \n\nIn conclusion: a little paradise in Medan!",

              "text": "We stayed for three separate 1 night stays, to break up our 3 week adventure in Sumatra. From the moment you enter the gate, you feel you have arrived somewhere special - a tropical paradise and the perfect place to escape the hustle and bustle of Medan and stop to rest and relax a while. We needed 2 rooms to accommodate us all and stayed in 6 different rooms on our 3 visits - all were excellent, clean, comfortable, well equipped and relaxing. The pool was delightful. The restaurant service and food good. The breakfasts were also good, especially the freshly prepared breakfast box for our 5:30a.m departure to the airport - much appreciated, thank you! All staff were lovely and keen to please and the manager went out of his way to talk to us about our experiences, while we were in the pool area. We really enjoyed our stays here and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to everyone we know.",

We had a lovely and relaxing time here away from the hustle and bustle of Medan city. The staff at Hotel Deli made sure our stay was comfortable, they were very friendly and even helped us to arrange our spa massage and taxi transport to Medan city. \nThe hotel has lovely greenery all round the compound and a lake with two pairs of geese. It was really refreshing to stay here and we were glad we made the right choice to stay here instead of a city location. The hotel has a \"kampung\" (village) ambience to it. We came to Medan to visit relatives of my mother. Highly recommended!",

When i got settled in, I had a really tasty meal. The cook in this hotel is a real pro and makes great food! Also, within 2 hours the proprietor with the help of Dewi(an employee) organized an amazing itinerary to enjoy the rest of my time in Sumatra! I highly recommend this hotel to anyone I wish I could have stayed longer!",

Pool was welcomed by the kids after a dusty drive. Aircon in the room was working well. We had dinner in the restaurant which was tasty, and the breakfast was such a treat. Excellent service. Airport transfer was arranged by the hotel, and the driver was punctual and courteous. Thanks for a nice end to our holiday in Sumatra.",

In the lead up to trying to book the tour and gaining information they were very professional and prompt in responding too (which I felt was not the case for other tour operators). They were also very patient as I was trying to organise other tours in Borneo and Java at the same time. Ibu Diana who owns the hotel also made sure she came and spoke to us and made us feel welcome.\n\nOur first night was at Deli River hotel - which is an amazing place hidden away and not that far from Medan. Is a great place to stay at if you've finishing/starting a jungle trek or trip to Lake Toba. The breakfast is also very tasty, we were given so much food we asked to have the cakes and fruit packed away in a lunchbox, which the staff were helpful about (as we were due to start our six day tour).\n\nOver the next 6 days we stayed at accommodation (eco lodge bukit lawang, Mega Inn, Holiday Mikie Resort, Tabo cottages) from Bukit Lawang in the jungle right up to Lake Toba and the island of Samosir. My favourite part of the tour was the Jungle Trek and Elephant riding/washing. Probably because I love elephants so much too but had such a good time.\n\nOur driver, Pak Yoel, was a safe driver who always punctual and very friendly. I felt that the price was also good and would recommend this tour to anybody who wants to spend 7 days in Sumatra.\n\nTerima kasih,\nEmma and Gary",

              "text": "We stayed here for a night before our trip up country and a night before going onto Java. We arrived on an early evening flight and got to the hotel just after 21.00hrs. The hotel restaurant closes at 9 but the chef has stayed in case we needed a meal. A nice touch. We were met by a wonderful lady in charge and showed to a lovely room in the grounds and she could not do enough for us. At breakfast we had fruit eggs spring rolls toast and jam pasries and cake a brakfast wonderful served by the wonderful lady from the night before. The owner also took time to come over and introduce himself and ask if our stay had been ok again a nice touch,\nOn our return we again were met as if we were friends and this time had an evening meal which was also very good and again a wonderful breakfast.\nThis hotel is out of the centre of Medan and if you are looking to go aorund Medan then you would need a taxi, however these are very cheap. There is also not much to see or do around the hotel, so you have to use the hotel for meals etc.\nFor a base before and after or just for a few nights rest this place is an ideal oasis with great friendly staff. A real gem",

Located on the outskirts of Medan in a beautiful tropical setting full of singing birds and tropical flowers and where you can cool off in a well maintained and pristine swimming pool.\n\nOwned and operated by a Dutch-Inonesian couple (Dirk and Diana) who live on the premises and constantly look after your well being assisted by an English speaking staff.\n\nAlways working WI-FI and TV are available on the premises and in the privacy of your comfortable, clean, well kept and air conditioned room where the AC blower is not directed at you.\n\nThe restaurant serves delicious Indonesian as well as international food.\n\nThe same owners also operate a wonderful travel agency Tri Jaya Tours and Travel that can organize personalized trips of your liking throughout Sumatra and Indonesia while they can provide very reasonably priced private air conditioned cars with multilingual drivers and guides as I also personally experienced while traveling through Sumatra for 4 weeks.\n\nThanks to Dirk, Diana and their hotel and travel staffs they made a dream trip come true for me.",

The owner talked to us, really relaxed guy, he offered us to go to the jungle for a 1-day trek with the locals, really nice, everyone was so friendly and helpful, some of them could give information about the different plants and trees we saw! I really enjoyed it and will definitely recommend this place to others! \nFood is good, good taste and hygiene was good. Ac is not pointing at you through the night which is good if you want to avoid getting the flu. Definitely recommended! \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc",

The hotel is run by a Dutch guy and his wife and it is located on the outskirts of Medan. Medan is very crowded and loud but as soon as you get to Hotel Deli River you can relax in the beautiful garden or by the pool.\n\nThe food in the restaurant is good and the menu has good variation. The breakfast was big and delicious with fresh food, toast and local dishes.\n\nThe rooms are big and clean, with a view over the garden. The rooms have air conditioning and the beds are good.\n\nThe staff is very friendly and the owner makes sure everything is taken care of. One afternoon we went with Dirch the manager on a trek with his hashgroup. We went to a beautiful place outside Medan, with lots of jungle and wildlife. Afterwords we ate food and had a few beers. Really relaxed atmosphere and good people.\n\nI really recommend this hotel if you want to stay in Medan for a few days.",

The unique architecture adds to this feeling.\nPolite, friendly knowledgeable staff\nOwner managed I think, is always a plus to get that attention to detail and to deal with any issues quickly \nThe place seems to be suitable for wheel chair use, although not to EU standard\nThe rooms are not generous (there are family rooms), but with a generous sheltered terrace and its 'jungle' surroundings, we did not spend much time in the room\nHighly recommended for an extended stay or a quick refreshing stop in Medan on your way.  Unfortunately, I had only one night\nIn spite natural settings, unique building styles, it has all the modern trappings, good WiFi, beautiful pool, restaurant with a good wine list, flat screen TV. The breakfast was great, I felt it was made special for us\nThe owner is a keen hasher and I am sure he is happy to take you along into the jungle. This adds a rather unique experience to the stay. (ask him about it, if you do not know what it is).\nUnless you need to be located in the city, the drive out to Deli River is very much worth it",

We saw the \u00a0Little Egret, Cinnamon Bittern, the Black Eagle and the Island Collared Dove. As birdlovers it was really a treat to stay in a hotel with such a tropical garden. We also saw different kind of butterflies and squirrels. Concerning the hotel, the service was very good, friendly staff, nice meals, the breakfast was abudant, clean comfortable rooms \u00a0designed with high taste and lovely colors combination with private terrace overlooking the garden and pond. Lastly we mention the well maintained swimmingpool which we enjoyed. ",

For our hotel hygiene is of the utmost importance and as you can read in all the other comments people praise the cleanliness and high hygienic standards of Hotel Deli River. We have 3 rooms with refrigerator, these are the honeymoonrooms. Guests stayed in the family room. This room consists of one large room and a sideroom. There is 1 airconditioning with enough capacity to cool this accommodation. We never got any complaints about the coolness of this room and it is in use for already 3 years. About the luggage, of course we could have brought the luggage but one of the guests was in such a hurry and directly demanded the key before we could offer any extra service like calling our staff to carry the luggage. Concerning the price of our food: Guests had dinner in our restaurant with 4 persons and ordered the following menu: 1 portion fried prawn , 1 portion vegetables saut\u00e9, 1 portion chicken with tamarind sauce, 3 portions rice, 1 portion complete omelete, fried banana, 1 lemon tea and 1 big bottle of beer for a  total price of Rp 333.850 or US$ 23.00 which is a very reasonable price. In our restaurant we only use fresh ingredients without flavor enhancer or msg. When we approached guests and asked about their stay in the hotel they did not want to talk. Our staff tried their best to make guests feel comfortable but guests gave almost no reaction. Management Hotel Deli River.",

I cannot stand the traffic noise and congestion in Medan, this resort provides the respite from the very chaotic city.\n\nThe garden and public area of the mid size resort is well kept. The chalet style rooms are clean and comfortable. The restaurant serves very good food (lunch and dinner) and is even frequented by non guests especially during the weekend.\n\nService by reception staff is not friendly but the restaurant waiters are great. \n\nJust outside the resort (just a stroll), there are few Nasi Padang warung if you are sick of eating in the restaurants for all the time. There are also a minimart and local grocery shops. There is no fridge in the room though to keep drink cold.\n\nOverall, value for money and a good stopover place instead of the hellish Medan.",

It's almost surreal, surrounded by the peace and quiet of the (somewhat murky) pond, palm trees and imposing reception/restaurant building.\n\nThe pool is lovely, overlooking fruit trees down to a river. The only problem is that they divide this long pool with shallow/deep end dividers so you can't do laps.\n\nThe breakfast is very Indonesian (cakes, rice and a tiny bit of fruit), but sufficient. The restaurant has a nice dinner, and the staff we're accommodating (after they understand our English request) to us vegetarians. They also packed us an enormous \"box\" breakfast for our 4am departure to catch a flight to Bali.\n\nThe rooms were spacious, and had a tub as well as shower so we could do our laundry. The Wifi only worked on some devices! Strange.\n\nThe only disturbance to the peace was the evening prayers blasted several times daily from speakers in 4 parts of the city, seemingly in competition with each other.\n\nNice play to stop between Medan airport and the 2 1/2 hour trip to Bukit Lawang.",

The swimming pool was perfect, the rooms were spotless, with comfortable beds, and a lovely veranda looking out on the beautiful  garden. We had tasty dinners in the restaurant Omlandia. And last but not least, the staff is very friendly and made our stay from good to perfect :). Thanks to all at Deli River",

It is not in the center of town but further out, away from the madness of Medan traffic. We found this to be the best accommodation during our time in Indonesia with staff that made sure our stay was wonderful. Even the owners took a personal interest in our trip and experiences. The room was very comfortable, food delicious and a pool to relax finished it off nicely.",

Hotel situated in lovely surrounds with a lovely pool which looks out over the landscape.

Food was good.  I found them easy to deal with over the internet before booking.  We only stayed for overnight before travelling on.",

The room was beautiful and immaculate. We had a great time and would recommend this hotel as it is in a quiet part of Medan.",

There is a village with a few shops and laundry so not as isolated as some of the reviews would lead you to believe. \nThe rooms are very clean with A/C and hot showers. The restaurant is excellent but does close at 2100. Breakfast was included in the price. The other meals were in the upper price range by Indonesian standards but it is a hotel and in this case you get what you pay for. The hotel pool was a good size and well maintained. \nLast but by no means least, the staff were all very friendly and helpful. Dirk, the owner, even took us on a \"hash\", basically a hash through the jungle with a group of likeminded people. \nThis hotel is a good place to spend a couple of days. It also has an excellent tour company, Trijaya, which I will review separately but is also five star.",

Not far from Medan city to take in the palace, mosque and busy square. Nice relaxing pool, breakfast very good with a range of fruits, pastries and toast. Dinner was good and the bintang cold. Although an hour from the new airport, it is an interesting trip and transport is easily organised. Good wifi, wake up service and very friendly organisation.",

The wifi was fine and relatively fast. Since there is absolutely nothing around but a dirty and noisy street, guests must eat in the restaurant. The dishes are ok but pricy since there is 21% tax to be added. Unlike in other places in Indonesia forget about $ here everything is paid in rupies. 65$ a night (agoda) was too expensive for what was on offer even if an ok breakfast was included. There is an additional 50$ (two ways) for airport transfer.",

Our rooms are set in a tropical garden and it takes around 40 minutes by car to the city centre. \r\n\r\nWe have rooms with and without bathtub, all our Honeymoon Rooms have bathtubs and some of our Deluxe Cottages have bathtubs. Concerning the television, we have local television + 2 foreign channels, CNN and Deuthsche Welle (DW TV), both in English.\r\n\r\nFor the room prices, you can compare various booking sites as the prices differ per booking site and some sites offer lower prices. To ge the best rates please book directy to us.\r\n\r\nThe airport transfer return costs IDR 250000 (Indonesian Rupiah) equivalent to US$ 19 for two persons. \r\n\r\nWe are a small internationally oriented Indonesian family company and we accept payments in Euros, Dollars and Rupiahs. \r\n\r\nConcerning the prices in our Restaurant Omlandia we give the following example: A Nasi Goreng costs IDR 57.000 which is equivalent to US$ 4.50. This meal consists of Nasi Goreng with omelette, three sticks sat\u0117, salad and krupuk (shrimp crackers), which is not overpriced at all. Fish filet with tartar sauce, French fries, and a fresh salad with a big bottle of beer costs IDR 132000 which is around US$ 9.5. The Value added taxes (VAT) in our restaurant is 10%.\r\n\r\nIn our restaurant we use only the best and the freshest ingredients. \r\n\r\nThank you so much for your stay at Hotel Deli River!",

The owner, Diana, along with her tour manager Juli, not only provided much assistance to us in planning our itinerary, but Diana even took the time to call us after we had left the hotel, when we were en route with her driver, to ensure that all was going well and answer any other questions we might have.\n\nIf you are not looking for a hotel in the heart of the Medan, the Hotel Deli River is highly recommended.",

              "text": "Overall this is a very clean and well run hotel with beautifully maintained gardens but it's location is isolated. The street outside is very busy and dirty with not much on it except for a convenience store or two. It's not walking distance or an easy commute to the more central areas of Medan. It is also about an hour to or from the airport (longer in rush hour). Please find a detailed summary below\nPositives: quiet, good food in restaurant, air conditioning, cable TV, wifi in main areas and room, beautiful gardens, play area for kids\nNegatives: isolated from city, not walkable to other restaurants/main stores\nI would overall recommend stay here if you're looking for a quiet, isolated spot and don't wish to be in the main region of Medan.",

The gardens were very peaceful and lush -  complete with two amiable quacking ducks!.  \nOur cottage room was very modern,  clean, cool and spacious.  \n\nThis owner operated hotel is a credit to Diana and Dirk.  Diana took care of all of our arrangements for the tour and did so very gracefully and cheerfully as we had left it all to the last minute.\nThe staff  were bright and  most attentive and food in the restaurant tasty.  It was also a nice change to sample some Dutch treats like the croquettes.\n\nWe would definitely recommend this hotel for a guaranteed comfortable and enjoyable stay.",

              "text": "We stayed two nights at Hotel Deli River, at the beginning and end of a 15 day trip through North and West Sumatra that we arranged through Tri Jaya Tour and Travel (operated by the owners of the hotel, Diana and Dirk) in November 2014.  As another reviewer has already described it, the hotel is in an oasis like garden compound situated in the middle of bustling Medan.  The room we stayed in was lovely and came fully equiped with electric kettle and other amenities.  The staff were extremely polite and hospitable, not to mention very efficient and attentive.  The hotel has a pleasantly laid out restaurant which offers very good food at reasonable prices.  The hotel and restaurant were both spotlessly clean.\n\nWe would also highly recommend Tri Jaya Tour and Travel.  They dealt with us in a highly professional and responsive manner, from our initial email inquiries to our departure from Medan at the end of our trip.  The travel itinerary which they arranged for us was well thought out.  We saw a wide variety of things in North and West Sumatra (including Medan, Bukit Lawang, Berestagi, Lake Toba and Samosir Island, Bukkittinggi, Lake Maninjau, Harau and Padang).  The schedule allowed us ample time to breathe and see things along the way.  We were never rushed and had the flexibility to do our own thing when desired throughout the trip.  The hotels were excellent, including the very hospitable arrangements at Iqbal Homestay in the beautiful Harau area.  Diana took the time upon our arrival to offer useful advice on practicalities and things we could do with our free time, and we enjoyed our conversations with Dirk on his historical researches into Medan's history upon our return to Medan.  Last, but not least, our driver cum guide, Erwin, was first class.\n\nThank you to all!",

Our room was very large, spotlessly clean with extremely comfortable beds, a rare treat in Asia.  \n\nThe owners, Dirk and Diana were warm and welcoming and ensured we were taken care of in every respect.  The staff were friendly and efficient and the food was fresh and delicious. Inclusive breakfast was a feast we looked forward to every morning and varied every day; we were treated to a wide range of delicacies every day which included toast, jam, honey, boiled eggs, vegetable fritters, pineapple muffins, fresh fruit, scrambled eggs, sticky rice, doughnuts etc as well as great coffee and fresh fruit juice.  It more than set us up for the whole day!\n\nWifi was fast and reliable in all areas of the hotel.\n\nWe would highly recommend Hotel Deli River to anyone visiting Medan or travelling through North Sumatra, it\u2019s clear to see why this is the number 1 hotel in Medan.  We would also highly recommend Tri Jaya tours (tours@trijaya-travel.com) which is the tour company also run by Dirk and Diana, during which we visited Lake Toba, Samosir Island, Berestagi volcanoes and hand fed the majestic orang-utans in Bukit Lawang.  It was a trip we\u2019ll never forget.\n\nThank you Dirk and Diana for being wonderful hosts and great ambassadors for Sumatra.  We hope to  be back one day! :-)",

              "text": "We had a wonderful stay at this beautiful and well organized hotel. The hotel is managed by very friendly and helpful people and owned by leuke Dutch/ Indonesian people. It was a perfect mix between being relatively close to the city of Medan and staying in the oasis of a quiet, calm and safe environment. \n\nOur teenaged children enjoyed the pool and restaurant (free Wifi :)) with next to Indonesian food also pannenkoeken en poffertjes on the menu. The hotel/ restaurant has a wonderful view and decor. \n\nWe arranged our tours and trips through/ from this hotel for a part of Sumatra, they have the best connections to give you a smooth and yet authentic sight. We specially liked our (Hotel Deli connected) senior driver and guide Mr. Erwin since he was calm, always on time and he had a lot of nice stories on the area. He was helpful and friendly, all English spoken. We came to this hotel in our first 3 days which was perfect for acclimatizing from our Dutch to the Indonesian world and temperature. After doing a roundtrip to the jungle and lake Toba (well organized by Deli) we wanted to come back for a 'pause' in a familiar place. We felt very welcome and at home.\n\nPrices maybe little above Indonesian average but still for European standards very reasonable. Price/ quality is very good, specially with children (pool, large terrain etc.) and for people who want to see crowded and historical Medan but still enjoy the quietness of a spatial and clean hotel.\n\nI would describe Deli River as the best kept secret of the Medan area.",

All is very clean and the owners and their staff are so nice and helpfull. They arranged pick up at the airport and we had a trip to the Jungle in the mountains. All was just perfect. The locations is a little out of the center of Medan, but we loved it. The prictures on their webpage are good but it is more nice when you get there.\nThanks for a perfect stay in Medan, Indonesia.",

We stayed in the honeymoon suite, with its own excellent bathroom and a lovely high bed (although we found the pillows a bit small and hard). Diana (of Trijaya Tours) organised our travel in a comfortable car, with a reliable, considerate and friendly driver, for our trip to Samosir Island. We stayed on the island for 3 nights in the Toledo Inn (a very large hotel, beautiful buildings and gardens, a wonderful view of the lake, although rather impersonal in our experience - but choices on Samosir seem to be limited). Our driver showed us many fascinating aspects of Batak life in that area, and we spent the last night at  the Grand Mutiara hotel in Berastagi . This was another large hotel, more luxurious than the Toledo Inn & catering for large tour groups. The dining room was excellent & there was a fantastic view of the volcano Mt Sinabung smoking away, from the hotel foyer.",

All so helpful and lovely. \nWe organised a tour through Trijaya Travel and they work out of the Hotel Deli River. Juli organised our trip to Bukit Lawang to see the Orangutans plus to Tangkahan to see the elephants. Our driver/tour guide was Rudi and he was above and beyond fantastic! If you can ask for him, do! He went out of his way to make sure we had the ultimate trip. I can't say enough great things about Rudi and our tour. \nMedan is so Hectic and the Hotel Deli River is like a little sanctuary away from the craziness. \nFantastic experience!",

The owners could not have been more hospitable and helpful. They arranged the full itinerary for us together with an excellent tour guide Deny who went out of his way to make the whole experience thoroughly enjoyable.\nThe Hotel itself is a perfect green oasis and away from the hustle and bustle of Medan. Rooms are  spacious, comfortable and have lovely balconies overlooking the tropical gardens.\nThis is the second time we have visited the Medan/Lake Toba region with the first some 30 years ago. Given our unforgettable experience and privilege of seeing the Orang-utans at Bukit Lawang our next visit will be much sooner.",

Hotel offers very clean, rarely quiet place in the middle of small private \u201ebotanic garden\u201c, air-conditioned rooms with TV, C+W water, beautiful clean swimming pool, tasty cusine (I can honestly recommend to try a chicken sote) and very experienced owners in indonesian sights and history, conductive to their guests with advice. Every time in Deli River Hotel I could be sure that everithing will be perfect. This is in Indonesia still very uncommon.\n...and don\u00b4t forgot order to breakfast a noodle menu! :-)",

The swimming pool is very nice and relaxing after a hot day. It has a great view on the Deli river and makes you almost forget you are near the centre of this large city. The restaurant serves good food. Staff is helpful and nice. The owner is a historian and was very helpful in planning our trip. We had a quick response to our e-mails and the staff helped us to rearrange the whole trip when we missed a flight to Medan and arrived 2 nights later. Thanks!",

The rooms are clean and comfortable and the staff personable and well trained.  We only ate the Indonesian food which was very good indeed.  We particularly enjoyed the breakfast with home made bread and pineapple jam. Tri Jaya Travel is operated by the same people and the trip they offered to Lake Toba and the surrounding area was well run - excellent driver and English speaking driver, with good hotels along the way.  There is a lot of driving involved on poor roads but it is very interesting and we felt worthwhile.",

Frankly, we didn\u2019t find the noise to be a problem, largely as Medan is a small airport with few flights and no night flights.\n\nThe restaurant, in a separate block from the bedrooms, serves excellent breakfasts and good, though not exceptional, Indonesian and European main meals. \n\nService throughout our time there was faultless, with friendly staff eager to look after us.  The hospitable owners, a Dutch academic and his wife, are a mine of information about North Sumatra and especially Medan.\n\nFree internet access is available by Wifi or using the hotel\u2019s own computer.  Free transfer from the airport, a twenty minute drive, is also offered.\n\nWe would definitely stay there again.",

I can\u2019t say enough good things about the place. We were only here for 2 nights at the start of our holiday and didn\u2019t feel the need to set foot outside until it was sadly time to move on.",

The main house/building has 2 big restaurant spaces (1 for breakfast and 1 for lunch/dinner) where their delicious food is served. Definitely try out the bitterballen (we had to being Dutch)!\nThere's also a great pool to swim in and relax by.\nIt is located just a little bit outside Medan so not ideal if you're there to really visit Medan (unless you're willing to get a driver), but we enjoyed it so much at the property that we didn't leave. It is however relatively close (1hr drive) to the airport so perfect if you want to relax a little before you fly.\nWould highly recommend!",

From the moment you drive into the property, you are captivated by the charm of your surroundings. It was the perfect location to commence and conclude my jungle and wildlife adventures in the jungles and surroundings of North Sumatra (which were also organised by the hotel/Tri Jaya tour and travel). It really was the perfect place to unwind and recharge after a long-haul flight, surrounded by the well-kept and manicured garden, great food, and the wonderfully attentive staff. All these made my stay at Hotel Deli River such a pleasure to travel to and spend time in Medan.\n\nThe fusion cuisine, vegetarian food options, homemade/grown breads/spreads/vegetables/spices, happy hour and freshly brewed single origin local coffee were all exceptional (especially breakfast). I was also fortunate enough to be staying on a Saturday evening where a live DJ session was also offered. It was a wonderful atmosphere and opportunity to meet some locals.\n\nThank you so much for such a wonderful experience and stay. \n",

This is great - you can enjoy the prayers from the conmfort of your bed. Also quite rightly conversation at dinner is impossible -  better to focus on prayer. Beyond that students of urban sprawl will find plenty of study material on the doorstep. The concierge was very happy to let me carry my own case up the stairs",

In reaction to your complain about sounds from outside we have put extra isolation in all rooms as well as automatic door closers to minimize sounds from outside. So far very few guests complained about this matter. On the contrary, the majority of our guests praised the quiet and relaxed atmosphere of Hotel Deli River and did not mention any sounds from outside. Considering the assistance of carrying your luggage, our staff always offers to assist with the luggage. In your case you already had carried it yourself so quickly to the room before our staff could have helped you. We are a small scale eco-friendly family hotel in a tropical garden with over 20 species of tropical birds in our compound. We will always do our utmost to offer our guests a nice stay in our hotel.

Even some locals swim with their daily dress in the pool and the staff of the hotel tried to address this to the guests.  We appreciate the effort of the staff to solve this kind of problem to maintain the hygiene of their pool.  We saw this on the spot.\n\nWe will come back again to this place",

While a central hotel was closer to shopping and malls, it was also very hot and the students did not feel safe when leaving the hotel. In contrast, Hotel Deli River is outside the city, with green gardens, a lovely pool and a safe environment. At the airport, we were greeted by wonderful staff in traditional dress and one of the owners, Bu Diana came to meet us herself. The staff and students enjoyed our stay at the start and end of our Sumatran road trip. The hotel staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean and the restaurant is excellent. Hotel Deli River is also helping us to minimise our plastic usage with water refills available. Thank you for taking care of us!",

Really love that they have a focus on being environmentally sustainable and reducing plastic waste too. The staff are so kind and friendly, and they do an incredible job at the breakfast spread that's a little different every morning. Highly highly recommended! Clean, tidy and well-presented rooms, great pool and outdoor areas also, good wifi too.",

It was the nicest accommodation we had out of all Indonesia, including Bali!\n\nThe bathroom had the best fixtures and water pressure we'd seen anywhere in Indonesia. The bed was wonderfully large and comfortable. It's hard, but we have a memory foam mattress back home, so we're accustomed to firm.\n\nI can't say enough good things about the immaculately manicured grounds. it was a pleasure walking around them. It was also nice and quiet, being removed from the busy street. And the property is surrounded by green space as well. \n\nThe main building, where the dining hall is located, made us feel like we were at a five-star resort. Breakfast was more than we could eat, service was great, and we really wanted to stay longer at the Hotel Deli River. Even if you're just passing through Medan like we were, spend an extra night or two. You won't regret it.",

My room was clean, very well kept, no-smoking, equipped with AC and WiFi, included a different very creative breakfast every morning. Dinner at Omlandia restaurant includes Indonesian and Western food. Room and food are very reasonably priced. The owners and staff are multilingual and very customer oriented. I will definitely be back at this hotel for my next trip to this exotic and friendly country. Highly recommended.",

It was a surprise to find such a paradise after riding through very crowded streets of Medan. Well hidden, nice tropical garden and pond. Building all well maintained. \nStaff was very friendly and helpfull. Food and drink were very good, high standard. \nThe pool in the back of the hotel had a nice view on the river and helped us to come at ease after our journey.\nUnforgettable experience. We would definitely recommend this hotel and we hope to go back there in the future.",

The room was nice however bathroom could do with an upgrade, both shower and toilet leaked and shower setup made it impossible to keep water inside the bath (had a shub). Some new towels would be nice also as these were old and thin. Overall, stay was good and with a bathroom update this hotel would be worth 5/5.",

We are on our bikes and explore the area from here by bike. \nSince we are 3 months on the road we have to work through it (computer work) and this quiet place is perfect for that. Besides, we enjoy a few rounds in the swimming pool, the service, the conversations, the wonderful breakfast, the fragrant daily fresh flowers in the room and much more.\nSimply perfect!\nA real wonderful extra: here they take great care to avoid plastic. That's why you can get water in a recyclable bottle if you need it, whenever you need it.",

The room was clean and well maintained but it seemed a bit smaller than the advertised 42sqm, unless you include the patio. The curtains don\u2019t block a lot of light. If you easily wake up due to sunlight you will have an early start to the day. The place is not cheap but still on the acceptable side. The breakfast was simple but the Mie Goreng were some of the best I ever had.",

              "text": "The Hotel Deli River oozes old world charm. The main house welcomes guests with wide open windows, high ceilings, and elegant yet charming rooms. The whole grounds offer a haven from Medan\u2019s bustle. We enjoyed a dip in the swimming pool upon our arrival, as well as a restful nap on the lounge chairs. The Olandia restaurant is scrumptious. Some reviewers have complained that the hotel is far from the main city (12 km). It is perhaps so, but who wants to eat out when one of the city\u2019s best restaurants is right on the grounds of the hotel? As we were staying there before and after a trek in Bukit Lawang, we had quite a few meals. We sampled many Indonesian dishes, which all tasted refined. Try the soto ayam or the eggplant dish, for instance, or even the rendang or the sate ayam. However, leave some room for the apple pie (baked the Dutch way). Since I\u2019m speaking of food, the breakfast is very good and plentiful. The food is fresh, from the baked goods to the fruits and the home-baked bread.\nFinally, the rooms are spacious and airy. Each of them includes a patio where it\u2019s nice to just sit and read. Our only complaint here was that it would be nice to have non-smoking patios, as all are shared with a neighbour. We had to go into our bedroom, because our neighbour\u2019s smoke was bothering us.\nLastly, most of the staff was helpful and welcoming. However, a few, especially in the restaurant, seemed more interested in their cellphones than in serving customers. That puzzled us, and on a couple of occasions, we decided not to order dessert, because staff didn\u2019t seem too intested in serving us. \nThat was good for our waistline, perhaps not for the business\u2019 bottomline.",

It was so good that for someone like me, who's never had Indonesian food before to fall in love with it after having it once!! The staff were very polite and spoke good English as well. The room was spacious with air conditioning. Overall, a great experience with Hotel Deli River, and would definitely visit the hotel once again if I ever get back to Medan!",

We enjoyed 2 stays with 1 night in July and 2 nights in August being pre and post trekking in the Gunung Leuser National Park in Ketambe. \n\nHotel Deli River is surrounded by lush tropical gardens and is an absolute oasis amongst the hustle and bustle of Medan. The Hotel Deli River and Restaurant Omlandia provides a most relaxed, tranquil and serene ambience. The magnificent swimming pool is located at the edge of the valley facing the Deli River with the spectacular Sumatran Jungle as its backdrop. Simply stunning! \n\nThe Hotel Deli River staff are wonderfully warm and welcoming, continually smiling and always eager to provide assistance with whatever is required. Indeed, we were provided with a lovely breakfast box upon a 6:30am departure for the lengthy drive to Ketambe and again upon our 4:30am departure to catch a flight back to Bali. \n\nSyahfitri and all of the absolutely lovely staff made our stay a truly memorable experience. Excellent location, accommodation, service, staff and food. We highly recommend The Hotel Deli River and eagerly look forward to our next stay.",

At that time the rate for 1 US$ was around Rp.10.000. \n\n\nFrom 1st of July until 15th of September 2018 our high season rate is Rp. 810.000. Now 1 US$ is equal to Rp 14.500. \n\n\nFrom 15th of September 2018 during low season the price of a deluxe cottage in our hotel is Rp. 750.000.  \n\nPlease calculate also devaluation in Indonesia. \n\nWe are a small scale hotel of only 14 rooms. We have to maintain our rooms, swimming pool and our  large garden as the concept of our hotel is eco friendly green environment. We use a lot of fresh ingredients from our garden in our kitchen. We strive to give the best service to our guests with the limited rooms that we have. \n\nWe hope our explanation is clear\n\nManagement of hotel Deli  River\n",

We wanted something away from the city with a bit of luxury as a little treat in between our backpacking holiday & extremely happy with our choice.\nThe staff were wonderful, the rooms large & comfortable with a great shower. As per other reviews, this really is an oasis & would recommend Hotel Deli River to others.",

The staff is amazing too and will take care of anything you need with a big smile on their face. \n\nThe breakfast they provided was very good, everything was fresh. Ww also had dinner two nights here and were not disappointed.  It is definitely expensive than what you can get outside but worth it. There is anyway nothing close to the resort for you to go out and sample unless you are willing to walk and speak the local language. \n\nWe also tried their travel service for airport pickip and trip to Lake Toba. Although slightly expensive, the service was great.  \n\nThe soundproofing in the rooms is not good and you can hear sounds drom outside if anybody passes or talks. ",

              "text": "We stayed 2 nights at the start of a long trip around several islands of Indonesia and what a place for our first insight into this fabulous country! This small hotel is located 18km outside central Medan and about 40 minutes from the airport. The only reason I've given 4 stars is distance from any significant local amenties (and lack of choice for breakfasts) but if you don't mind not straying far it would be hard to beat this place. Can't recommend highly enough.\n\nService was excellent, food was good, if a little short on choice, especially at breakfasts when fixed plates were provided (we think this was due to there being so few guests); the grounds are beautiful with a small infinity pool looking straight down into dense forest and Deli River below; the rooms are large and comfortable with verandahs great for just soaking up the view and atmosphere. \n\nThe best thing about the hotel is the amazing staff who were always laughing & smiling infectiously and keen to try out their English and chat about Indonesian life when they had time. We returned for another night at the end of our time in Sumatra and the staff welcomed us like long lost family.\n\nWe did arrange a becak tour to take us out into nearby countryside for a morning and especially enjoyed strolling through fields growing every kind of veg & fruit and laughing and joking with local farmers despite the language barrier!",

If you want to explore Medan, recharge from a visit to the jungle or prepare for departure by airplane go to Deli River and you will be pleasantly surprised. \n\nWe stayed for two nights at the end of our Java - Sumatra trip. Great recharge after Bukit Lawang and a nice relaxing end to our trip. \n\nThe place is relatively large for the few rooms it offers and therefore feels spacious. Everything you see around you is green, well decorated. \n\nThe rooms are comfortable and offer tea, coffee, drinking water (hotel makes an effort to reduce waste), bathroom with bath, a/c, television, good wireless internet, desk, deck with chairs and view on the garden, mini bar, good bed and some art. \n\nThe restaurant is nicely designed and offers a natural flow of wind supported by fans. You can sit inside or outside. The staff speaks English and provides good explanations on the dishes. The food is delicious and freshly made. Indonesian, Chinese and European dishes available. And some Dutch specialities (kroket, bitterbal, ..). The food is amazing and reasonably priced. \n\nBreakfast is served to order or via buffet. You can order additional food if you want at no extra charge. \n\nThe hotel arranged a very nice heritage tour as well as airport shuttle for us. Good reliable driver. \n\nIf you want to go and explore Medan you can order a taxi or catch a Grab (local Uber- works very well!). \n\nThe hotel offers a lush garden and beautiful swimming pool.\n\nTo summarise: look no further and stay here at this boutique hotel with lovely staff, comfortable facilities and relaxing environment.

There was only 2 other guest so the place was very quiet, lovely and peaceful. We ate in the restaurant both nights and the food was good, we stayed with the local dishes which were very tasty.  The room was spacious and beautifully decorated with everything you need for a couple of nights stop, beds were so comfortable.The grounds are lovely and serene with a nice pool if the weather is good, nothing really outside the grounds so transport needed to go anywhere. The morning breakfast was a highlight,  being served on lovely linen table cloths looking out to the lake was very nice and the home made bread and pastries were delicious, served with eggs and fruit, the whole service was excellent.  Staff were lovely and friendly which made our stay very pleasant indeed.",

Deli River is a nice place with a large pond and beautiful garden, little bit outside Medan. They also have a swimming pool. The big rooms (cottages) are very comfortable with a terrace overlooking the pond. Nice, friendly and cheerful singing staff always trying to make your stay as pleasant as possible. You feel immediately at home.\nBreakfast is nice, with fresh fruits, juices, marmalade and homemade cakes. If there are many guest there is a buffet otherwise you will be served at your table. And at dinnertime they serve different delicious western and local meals. As it is an open air restaurant they provide anti mosquito, a nice service. The restaurant is also overlooking the pond.\nDeli River is just outside Medan, so they can arrange a taxi for you if you don't have a car, e.g. a Blue Bird. But you can also use Grab (just took over Uber in Southeast Asia). Grab is also useful for getting around in Medan because it's difficult to catch a cab in town.\nTheir driver, Yul, brought us to the ferry at lake Toba, a whole day drive because we asked for the touristic route. Very nice and interesting. And Yul was very entertaining.",

              "text": "We were happy to stay two nights at this oasis of tranquility in the outskirts of Medan on a recent business trip. A hotel driver successfully picked us up at the airport; the transfer journey was long and smoggy, however (well over an hour), because of rush hour arrival. Everything was up to reported standards of excellence, especially the food and the service. Breakfast was just a continental breakfast, however, not the usual spread and wide choice of dishes usually available in Asian hotels. Be aware of this if you need something more substantial to get a good start to the day.\n\nThe only curious thing about the room we stayed in is the fact that the air-conditioning unit was mounted so that it faces AWAY from the main part of the room and into the bathroom, i.e. away from the bed instead of onto it \u2013 where most likely you'll be relaxing and trying to cool off from the humid heat outside. Because of this we found it hard to cool down as expected; it took over 20 minutes of indirect air-con to cool down, in fact.\n\nAlso be aware that there's a chorus of muezzins that call to prayer in the early morning hours and again at night; this may affect your sleep. Personally I'm used to it from travelling in Turkey, Morocco, etc.",

Some of the 14 rooms have a view from their balcony. The rooms are simple but functional. With airco blowing in the right direction (not being your face/bed). The shower has warm water, a toilet and small washing basin. There are rooms with double and two single beds. A fridge could be placed in the room at request. There is a rather big swimming pool but due to safety measurements it is not really possible to have a good swim. Wonderful view into the valley from the pool.\nThe restaurant serves nice food and is a cozy place to sit and spend some hours. Breakfast especially was superb. Lots of variation, nice prepared dishes, fruit and fresh fruit juice, home baked bread. Really fantastic. The owners travel agency facilitated a well-organized trip to Lake Toba for us. Excellent price/quality balance.",

              "text": "As a first-timer to Sumatra, I chose this property as my base to start and conclude my adventure. Not having experienced Indonesia much, besides touristic Bali, it was a welcome change to make the choice to discover North Sumatra's landscape of natural-beauty. Hotel Deli River was no exception to this, a true garden-oasis in the heart of the big-city and jungle. \n\nMy boyfriend and I stayed in the Deluxe cottage. From our balcony we could unwind, relax, enjoy and appreciate our surroundings that overlooked the pond and its resident geese. The bedding was comfortable, bathrooms were clean, room was naturally-lit throughout the day, spacious and airy. There was also a convenience store located nearby, within walking distance (within/approx 200m) which was also great. One thing we also noticed was the property had ramps throughout, making it completely accessible and wheelchair-friendly for everyone to enjoy! \n\nThe property was located just outside of the city-centre. The staff were so friendly, very well-informed and attentive to assist in arranging our transportation, to both, the city-centre and our trips to Lake Toba, Bukit Lawan, including to Borobudur in Yogyakarta! \n\nThe charming ambience of the restaurant was the perfect accompaniment to the freshly-prepared meals restaurant Omlandia provided. Being vegetarian, I was excited to see they offered tempe and eggplant toasted sandwiches, so delicious! Their extensive menu should satisfy the fussiest of eaters.\n\nThe pool overlooks the hotels vegetable/spice garden and the Deli river. It was well kept and maintained. With direct sun exposure within the pool and natural shade provided over the lounge, it was my ticket to relaxation.\n\nThe positive accounts and information obtained online through our research done prior to our stay, in our opinion, are true to detail. However, the friendliness, the warmth, the expertise and attention to detail of the staff, especially the owners, can only be captured and appreciated through a first-hand encounter. \n\nTo the management of Hotel Deli River, thank you for creating this space, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Upon our return back to Sumatra, we will definitely return to this property and recommend to our friends and family.",

A pond with geese separates the bungalow style room buildings from the restaurant and reception building (and pool area).  You know you\u2019re in a fast growing Asian city - during our stay the call to prayer from a mosque mingled with the singing of Christmas hymns from an evangelical church - but you\u2019re as removed from the city as you want to be.  \nThe breakfasts were excellent, with personalized touches.  The staff was delightful.  The fine, roomy, high-ceilinged restaurant serves traditional Indonesian and Dutch dishes (gado gado, sat\u00e9, soto ayam; bitterballen en patatjes met...). The Dutch owner of the hotel is a historian who\u2019s written books about Medan and the Dutch colonial times.  His Indonesian wife arranges tours with guides and drivers.  Our tours in Medan and to the Lake Toba region were tip-top.  \nHotel, restaurant and tours get our unqualified recommendation.",

The weather was just right, my friends and I had coffee, fried banana platter and enjoyed the afternoon there. Perfect for group of families and friends for gatherings or other functions. Place was big and comfortable enough albeit old-fashioned (but it's what they sell actually the classic vintage atmosphere surounded by lush greenery). Price was reasonable too.\nLocation not very easy to find, you really have to own good driving skills because along the way you will pass narrow streets on hilly landscape, but the journey from downtown medan area was worth it. it totally had the serene, peaceful ambient and comfortable setting to enjoy.",

A beautiful well kept garden / park with a pond and homegrown spices and flowers they use in the kitchen and for decoration. Beautiful private rooms that make you feel at home, very comfortable, each with your own terrace. The staff is extremely friendly and the absolute PLUS are the owners: very knowledgeable about the Dutch heritage in Sumatra but also all the sweet spots of both Medan and Sumatra. Diana and Dirk are very special warm people that love to share all they know. We did a memory lane trip to my mothers early youth when she lived in Medan in the 1940\u2019s. It was both emotional as interesting! Our driver and guide Yoel already working for over 15 years for Deli River topped it all, he showed us around Sumatra in a week and we laughed all the time and learned lots!! We hated to say goodbye!!!!",

The hotel has a colonial look-n-feel, combined with jungle-atmosphere. \n\nThe hosts are really friendly and always ready to help. The rooms are wonderful! Unlike other reviews, no problem with the mosquito's (as long as you keep the front door closed). They have a cosy balcony, large beds, television, closeth and a desk. The bathroom was very clean and best shower I had over all of Indonesia. \n\nThe pool is a nice extra and you can also take a book from the extensive book collection.\n\nThe diner menu offers a rich choise of local and western food. The quality is great. I recommend the chicken with Indonesian spices (but take a small side dish to go with that).\n\nHighly recommended hotel!",

After about an hours drive we arrived at hotel but it was dark so limited views.\nStaff very friendly and explained restaurant was shut but they could make something if we were hungry. 4 large cold beers was enough.\n\nGood sized family room but no nets so a few bites though Next morning we saw how close we were to the lake so we weren't surprised. \nInside and outside shower - we enjoyed the outside one watched by a squirrel.\nGrounds looked nice. \n\nFound breakfast disappointing after the previous reviews. Beautiful room with nice views but that is probably where it stops. One table was set with a cloth but reserved. For the others even though there were plenty of staff around you need to set your own. Lots of small dishes with bits of fruit, cakes, rice etc but for our 1st breakfast in Sumatra not quite what we expected. No offer of eggs/omelettes.\n\nWhen I compare this with the huge fruit platters and banana pancakes to die for prepared,later in the week, in the middle of the jungle on open fires it's probably just 5/10 for effort. \n\n",

Mosquitos\nWe often notice that guests sit on the private terrace in front of their room with the door open. We have made an announcement in all rooms that guests better keep the room doors closed to prevent the mosquitoes from entering. All the windows of our rooms are equipped with mosquito screens. Mosquitos cannot enter the room if windows and doors are closed.\n\n2. Breakfast\nOur breakfast on the day when you were in our hotel was a buffet breakfast so every guest served  themselves. The breakfast consisted of :\n-Toast from home made bread.\n- Butter, honey, strawberry jam. Furthermore, we served our home-made pineapple jam which is a favourite of our guests.\n-Cinnamon rolls, coconut bread (homemade and fresh from our kitchen)\n\n-Scrambled eggs. We put them in the pan stove to keep it warm. We hope that you have seen this pan stove. \n\n-If you ask our staff for an omelete we will be happy to prepare this for you. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udf3a\ud83c\udf38\n-Curry puff ( curry pie)\n-Nasi goreng and lemper ayam (fried rice and sticky rice with coconut and slices of chicken for our gluten free diet guests.\n-Fresh fruits like pineapple, papaya, banana. Also fresh vegetables such as cucumber and tomatoes.\n-Fresh pineapple and papaya juice, freshly blended in our kitchen. The fruits are often from our own garden.\n-Coffee and tea.\n\n3. Prepared table\nThe prepared table with table cloth was for a birthday celebration. For this special day we put extra flowers and a table cloth as a surprise for the guest.\n\n4. Daily variations and special requests\nEvery day we serve different dishes for breakfast, if guests stay more than 1 night they will have different choice of  breakfast. In case of special requests like gluten free dishes we prepare that on the breakfast table. We also include traditional Indonesian breakfast dishes. \nOur utmost priority is that our guests enjoy their stay as much as possible, and therefore we try to cater to the different needs of our guests. \n\nTerima kasih,\n\nManagement of Hotel Deli River",

Even though food in the restaurant had closed they went above and beyond to bring some curry and beers and drinks to the room and set it all out in our room for us. Nets on the beds, no mossy bites ( but we are in Sumatra after all ). Had the pool to myself in the morning at 7.30 for a swim and stretches. Breakfast was perfectly okay overlooking the pond and ducks. The staff were very helpful. Great first night to the holiday.",

              "text": "Ok, so I booked this place as a result of the great reviews, and normally tripadvisor is near enough the mark.. not on this one;-\n\nThe Good:\n-Friendly staff\n-Nice pool\n-Nice grounds (but way smaller than they look in photos.. this place isn't big)\n-they pack you breakfast for an early flight\n- you can get a really awesome massage from a blind couple they use which is great value\n\nThe Bad:\n-Mosquitos are abundant..we came here from Bukit Lawang in the jungle to stay here and it was much worse here- tons of bites despite repellent \n- The room. We had a family room. Beds didn't have nets and they are needed. The walls had multiple blood stains and smears from previous successful mosquito kills- gross. The windows locks were broken and windows could only be pulled closed and not fastened meaning we couldn't relax with our belongings unattended in the room! The TV in the room is an ornament as the fuzzy picture is unwatchable! \n-The restaurant. It's very expensive for Sumatra. The food is average at best. As mentioned we came here from Bukit Lawang which is a small outpost in the jungle. Every dish we had there was far superior to our food here and way cheaper! We sent food back uneaten! To top that my wife and son had bad tummies which we suspect may have been due to eating here! \n-The ride to the airport is expensive at 350000 rupiah one way Although this journey is one hour it's still expensive for the country. This wasn't exactly the handy to the airport hotel I thought it would be! \n\nTo sum up, we spent as much money eating here in one day as we did in 3 elsewhere in Sumatra, had the worst food of our stay, suspect the food for causing stomach upsets and all got badly bitten after staying in a shoddy room! Maybe I got unlucky but I certainly did not have the 5* experience others seem to have enjoyed. If I'm back in Medan I will stay elsewhere",

We have 14 rooms surround by a lush tropical garden. The grounds of the compound of Hotel Deli River consists of 1.2 hectares. Guests have complete walking access throughout the compound, all the way down to the Deli River. \n\nWe pride ourselves in providing the freshest produce possible, from garden to table, we grow pineapples, papaya, banana, nutmeg and other tropical produce. \n\nConcerning our kitchen, we seldom get complaints about the quality of our meals, on the contrary, people often appreciate our dishes. We are sorry to hear your wife and son had some tummie problems. This could be caused by the  peanut sauce (saus kacang) - which is known to stimulate the digestive process - in the Pecel dish you had. We often have guests who recover in our hotel from tummie problems they got elsewhere. We take hygiene in our kitchen very seriously. Our staff prepare our food with the utmost care. \n\nWe believe our food is reasonably priced. On the one occasion you did dine with us, your total bill consisted of: Pecel vegetable salad with peanut sauce and peanut crackers at Rp. 39.000  (around US$ 2.40) and spring rolls consisting of 2 pieces for  Rp. 30.000 (US$ 2.20). \n\nAlcoholic beverages however, in comparison to the food is more expensive due to the government tax, which is the case throughout Indonesia. In comparison to the food, the 7X 620mL bottles of beer did raise the total of your bill significantly. \n\nIn relation to the mosquitos, all of the windows in our rooms are fitted with mosquito screens. The additional use of the a/c in your room is also a deterrent. \n\nThank you for sharing your findings claiming stains on our walls. Management has checked all of our rooms however were unable to find any. \n\nWe are sorry to hear that you had difficulty with the windows. All our windows are fitted with proper locks. There might have been confusion about the mechanics of the lock. Our staff would have been happy to help and assist you :)  this issue may have also contributed to the mosquitos in your room. \n\nConcerning the price of the transfer we use normal fares. We pay correct salaries to our drivers as we firmly believe in sustainable tourism. We also only use reliable cars. \n\nYes, we are located one hour (45 minutes off-peak) from the airport and our transfers are priced accordingly. At 6:30am, the price for your transfer was increased slightly due to the out of office hours. Transfer price was Rp. 350.000 for 4 pax. \n\nMost of our guests appreciate our tropical garden, praise our reasonable priced meals, enjoy the well designed comfortable rooms.\n\nThe management of Hotel Deli River.\n",

              "text": "We received an immediate answer from the Deli River hotel in Medan on our email inquiries for visiting some places I recall from my youth in the North of Sumatra. The programme via Tri Jaya Tour and Travel looked perfect so we decided to come for a few days (were visiting family in Singapore). \nThe driver Deddy picked us from the new airport Kualanamu Medan and gave a tour through historic Medan. We liked to have a drink in restaurant Tip Top, still existing! We stayed two nights at Hotel Deli River, at the beginning and end of our short trip to Medan, Brastagi and Prapat.  Very happy with our stay in the beautiful hotel with tropical garden, a reel oasis in busy Medan. The staff were extremely friendly and hospitable. The hotel with his restaurant Omlandia offers good food. Our room was lovely and came fully equipped, the hotel, restaurant, swimming pool were spotlessly clean. The next morning after a excellent breakfast Deddy picked us up for the trip to Brastagi in Karo Hoogland. After a stop in Brastagi we drove to the waterfall Sipisopiso and the Kingshouse Simalungun Batak in Pematang Purba. We went with the ferry to the island Samosir in the lake Toba and stayed in a hotel right on the wonderful and beautiful lake. The next morning after a tour on Samosir we returned with the ferry via Prapat and local (Javanese) restaurant to Medan for dinner and overnight in hotel Deli River. Deddy came the next morning to bring us (very early) to the airport of Medan. Compliments for our excellent driver in a private air-conditioned car and also guide Deddy (speaks different languages, dialects, was punctually, witty). He gave all the for us important information about the different population, culture, nature, showed us several products off the plantations etc. \nWe had also interviews with Diana and Dirk, very sympathetic owners of the hotel and the Tri Jaya Tour and Travel. Dirk as historian has given us lots of information about the past! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hotel Deli River and our trip, we only regret the short stay for this beautiful visit to the North of Sumatra! We highly recommend Tri Jaya Tour and Travel for the beautiful and professional trip they has arranged for us!\nAnd recommend hotel Deli River in Medan as the only hotel possible for a stay in Medan/North Sumatra.",

He wanted to book a certain room and the guest changed his mind and he wanted to book another type of room. Shortly after this, he wanted to book a room for 1 night and after having discussed with his friends he decided to change his stay into  3 nights. We require 30% down payment for this reservation and he agreed to pay with his BCA card.\r\nAfter this reservation he told to our staff that we have to claim this payment to his guests from Holland when they check in. Our staffs found this strange  since this reservation is done by him and there is a charge from our bank for this payment clearance but the bank charge will be paid by us. Out of a sudden he became very angry and threatened to write negative comments about our service on Tripadvisor. There is no clear reason that he become angry...no reason at all...",

The staff is charming and welcoming, the rooms are spotlessly clean and nicely setup. In reality, the hotel is at least as good as it looks on the photos!   The hotel arranged our trip from/to the airport and everything went well. Food is very good. The only regret is that the kitchen closes at 9:30 pm (but maybe that was special because this was Ramadhan month). \nOne of the best things about this hotel is its peaceful location that comes as a welcome contrast to bustling Medan. Note that it still takes 1h drive to the (new) airport in Kuala Namu - but in fact this is still better than from a hotel down town.\nOverall highly recommended.",

What a great service, big room with a good bed, nice shower (!), great food, and what a peaceful surrounding in the busy Medan.\n\nThe tour we booked through at the hotel connected travel agency Tri Jaya Travel. Again, highly recommended. We did a 7 day trip with private car and driver along Tangkahan, Bukit Lawang (please go rafting! Was a great day was that), Berastagi, Lake Toba and back to Medan. It was a great experience. Everything was organized with perfection. \n\nWe have an unforgettable trip to Sumatra!",

The hotel is Ok, clean with nice gardens, and a great pool.  The beer is not so good but very nicely presented in a wee basket, food was bit weird we got a boiled egg of breakfast one day and we never got what we ordered when we asked for room service.  Fried rice was boiled etc there was a bit of a communication issue but the food itself was not bad. The owners were great and very helpful and the staff tried very hard to be helpful. They arranged a trip to see the orangs which was very good and the driver was the best we had in Indonesia very safe. I would probably not stay here again as the Grand was just so much better but if you don't want to pay millions for a night then this is a good clean hotel with all the services you cold want. This hotel is far away from anything except the river but taxis are cheap.",

Since we are a small scale eco-friendly family hotel with only 14 rooms we try our best to give personal service to our guests. Our hotel is not comparable to an international chain hotel with a totally different concept such as the Grand Aston. The beer we serve is Bintang Beer which is a tasty Indonesian beer, we serve it cold in a chilled glass. If guests did not get what they ordered for room service there must have been some communication problem, our staff always do their utmost to serve our guests in the best way. We have rooms with twin and double beds, if guests did not get the requested double bed it was not booked by the online booking company. There is a television in each room. We are happy to read that you write so positively about our staff who tried to be helpful and about our driver who was the best you had in Indonesia.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nManagement of Hotel Deli River.",

The hotel is very clean and their food at the restaurant is also very good. They have simple and decent spread for breakfast. The place is very quiet. They give you free Wifi access and the data speed is very good.The owner takes good care of you and makes sure you feel at home.As we had an early flight out of medan, they packed us breakfast box which is very balanced meal.

              "text": "My mother and I only had 3 free nights during our trip to Indonesia. We booked a 2 night stay in Bukit lawing through Trijaya Tour and Travel.\n\nWe were picked up by our driver at the airport. This driver had not mastered English yet, but this tour company does employ drivers who can speak English. My mom can speak Indonesian so she was able to communicate with our driver and the trip was a very animated one! At our request the driver took us to a little 'waring' because we really wanted to eat a Sumatran dish called \"rendang\". We took a bit of a risk eating at a waring on day 1 of our trip to Indonesia, but we enjoyed our food and had no GI upset afterwards.\n\nWe stayed at the beautiful Ecolodge Bukit Lawang Cottages. From there it was an easy hike to see the orang utans the next day. What an experience! we saw a mother and baby and later on a juvenile male. Our guide was very knowledgeable and very attentive to my 78 year-old mom for whom the initial part of the hike was quite steep. An extra guide actually came along in case my mom decided she could not continue. We walked through a rubber plantation to get to the reserve. On the way we saw Long-tailed macaque monkeys, Thomas Leaf monkeys. The forest was breathtakingly beautiful (so sad to know that so much of Suamtra's amazing rain forest has been destroyed by palm oil companies--SHAME ON THEM-and the government for letting this happen. \n\nThe ecolodge was an amazing spot: beautiful gardens, lots of information on orang utans and other flora and fauna. The restaurant was very cozy and served delicious indonesian food (we really enjoyed the fried tofu, soups and gado gado)",

Also has an airconditioner.\nStayed a total of 3 nights here at either end of a tour we arranged and we were very happy with our selection.\nFood was good in the Omlandia restaurant and the staff were always helpful and the manager was friendly too. Strange thing for us was that the room had a hairdryer but not a fridge, however no other places we stayed had one either.\nfourposter style bed with mosquito net surrounds and room size was ok.\nprices whilst higher than elsewhere in Sumatra that we experienced still seemed cheap at start of holiday.\nHotel is about an hour from the new airport or centre of Medan but then the traffic is pretty bad everywhere in Medan with most lane markings or traffic islands seeming to be for decoration rather than splitting up traffic.\nFound a few mosquitos here but the hotel provide a local repellant in the restaurant and we ended up buying and using the same as it smelt and went in so much better than the bushmans we took with us.\nHappy to recommend this hotel",

When I was staying there, there was some noise during the daytime from the construction of an additional building on the premises which took away a bit of the piecefull atmosphere. The room I stayed in was clean, but pretty basic, with two single beds (though I had asked for a queen sized bed) and a very tiny tv. The staff were friendly and the food served in the restaurant was nice, but the restaurant appeared a bit on the pricy side for a Medan restaurant. All in all I found my stay in Deli River OK, but both room and restaurant seemed a bit overpriced (European prices) compared to what else you can find in Medan. ",

Concerning the price of meals we give the following example: a nasi goreng in our restaurant costs Rp. 54.000 in Indonesian rupiah equivalent to US$ 4.5. This consists of nasi goreng with omelete, three sticks sate, salad and kerupuk, which is not overpriced. About our rooms, they are very comfortable as you can read in other guestcomments. They are beautifully set in a tropical garden with view to the fish pond surrounded by fruit trees like mangosteen, rambutan, mango and guava.

When we had an early check out, they gave us a breakfastbox to take with us! The rooms are big and clean,no refrigerator but you can use the one in the restaurant. The swimmingpool is lovely with an amazing view.\nWe arranged our trip to Lake Toba and Brestagi also at their travel agency, Trijaya travel. If you want to know about the history of Medan, just ask the owner, he would love to tell you about it.\nWhen I go back to Medan, I would stay here again.",

The restaurant was good by Sumatran standards, but I would not recommend buying wine - its too difficult to ensure reasonable quality and the price is high, especially if its 'off'. Breakfast was excellent, but if you're working to a schedule allow plenty of time as things can be a bit slow. All in all, a good place to stay - probably much better than options in Medan.",

The staff are attentive and polite. However, the restaurant is a complete let down - we had dinner there - we ordered steaks but two of us had  steaks that were rancid which we sent back - the staff's attitude was a little non comital - we then ordered the more expensive T bone steaks which the others had ordered as they had nothing else but were still charged the full price.  We ordered wine which was on the menu as dry French white wine but was nothing of the sort...Again, when we sent it back, we were told they had stopped stocking french wine because no one bought it and so had substituted for a cheap local alternative.  I think the problem was that they just don't know how to cook western style food and we should have known better than to order it - although the majority of the clientele that night were western.  We all had tummy upsets the following day.",

Going to see the amazingly-kept grounds is worth the trip alone.  The restaurant is also first-class, with very tasty Indonesian and Chinese-inspired dishes, but also a solid Western-inspired menu.  One night, I was craving a steak and the chef did not disappoint!  Visiting Medan from anywhere, especially abroad, and not staying here would be a serious mistake!",

After Ms. Juli had called the company she asked clients to talk directly to the company. But guests refused to talk because of the language barrier. Guests wanted to know the price of a chartered car after which Juli translated the price. This was all that happened, there were no other intentions and nothing about commission.

The rooms were clean, beds comfortable, and the service wonderful. It was a great place to stay with children; there is a flying fox. playground and attractive pool area. This hotel has real character and it is the only place I would stay if I return to Medan in the future",

              "text": "We stayed at this tranquil oasis twice during our trip to Sumatra \u2013 once after our late arrival flight into Medan, and again prior to an early flight to Banda Aceh. It is a beautiful retreat away from the noise and busyness of Medan.\n\nWe stayed in a different room on each occasion \u2013 firstly an upper level twin room, and later a lower level double room.\nBoth rooms were comfortable, with good beds, tea and coffee making facilities, a TV (CNN being the only English speaking channel), air conditioning (both very quiet AND effective) and a clean bathroom. The second room had a bath and shower, the first only a shower. Wifi is generally available, but this wasn\u2019t working on our first visit, worked perfectly the second time around.\n\nThe call to prayer early in the morning felt exceptionally loud, and we could hear children singing from a location nearby at breakfast. Also the hotel is beneath the flight path to and from the airport, which didn\u2019t really change when the airport moved to Kuala Namu (which it had by our second visit). Pick up from the airport is free of charge, and drop off at Kuala Namu cost us 190,000 Rp. It can take more than an hour to get to the new airport, but early in the morning (we left at 6.30am) it took us only 45 mins.\n\nThe rooms are in buildings on one side of the property, with a pretty pond separating it from the grand main building (with a towering Batak type roof) where the reception and restaurant \"Omlandia\" are situated. We ate in the restaurant only on our second visit \u2013 the food was good, but pricey compared to the rest of Sumatra in our opinion. But their Dutch Apple pie was really good! Breakfast was fruit, toast and a hard boiled egg, served with juice and tea/coffee. For our early morning departure to the airport, a packed breakfast was provided.\n\nBehind the main building is a swimming pool, with surprisingly warm water, which overlooks the river and surrounding countryside. There are a limited number of sun loungers and chairs surrounding the pool. Items can be ordered from the restaurant for delivery to poolside.\nThe staff generally speak English quite well, and are very friendly and polite.\n\nAll in all this was an excellent place to stay, and I\u2019d recommend it to anyone needing to spend a night in Medan.",

Airconditioning works well. Supplimentaries such as coffee, tea and bottles of  water (definitively no tap water!!) are present. \nThe swimming pool is nice and offers a panoramic view over de garden below. Though some extra sun beds would have been welcome.\n\nThe restaurant is situated on a higher part of the compound and has an open structure, allowing a cooling wind coming through. The menu is fine, including Dutch specialities as 'poffertjes', 'bitter ballen' and apple pie (very good).\nService is of more than average quality, most people speak English well and are very helpful. \n\nThis is an excellent place to stay to get used to the climate (for new comers) or to relax from a trip to the jungle. If you are interested in the Dutch history of Medan (tabacco and rubber plantations) or Dutch architecture contact the owner. He has some short trips available showing you the highlights of the city.

It is quite far from the centre, but is quiet (except for a couple of mosques) and has a great pool, with kids area. Staff are very nice - not everyone speaks English, but they try their best and help out with everything they can. Food at the Omlandia is excellent and they provided lots of little extra bits and pieces for our toddler at no aditional cost. I specifically would like to mention the great Judy, who managed to not just book us on all kinds of flights, but helped out in a fantastic way when our daughter needed to go to a hospital.",

              "text": "Hotel 'Deli River' is the perfect place to recover from the long continental flight, and to get used to the tropical heat. After we were picked up from the airport, we crossed Medan trough heavy  and hectic traffic before we reached the hotel, just outside the city center. It's unbelievable what a great job they had done creating such a comfortable, quiet place on that spot. Rooms with view on the gorgeous tropical garden were really comfortable. We indulged in the freshly made fruit juices and cold Bintang lager sitting on the edge of the swimming pool with view on River Deli, and really enjoyed the extended breakfast and lovely Indonesian food on the terrace. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and very motivated to make it a pleasant stay.\n\nOur mission on our journey to Sumatra was \"Nostalgia Belanda\", a quest for our family's roots. Ever since the moment we arrived at the Medan airport, Triyaya tours, related to the Deli River Hotel, put an enormous effort in making it a carefree and beautiful 14-day travel from Medan to Padang for us. In advance we discussed our wishes for our journey with Triyaya tours. Because of their knowledge about the history of the colonial era, as well as their obvious experience as a tour operator, they were well suited to give helpful advise regarding the content of our journey. It turned out to be a journey consisting of a pleasant combination of sight seeing, hikes and mooches, and rest days. Our tour guide/driver Yul made the trip even more unforgettable, driving us around not only safely, but also with so much care and being so involved with us, not to mention his great sense of humor. He relentlessly tried to find every place or building we wanted to see. We warmly recommend the Deli River Hotel and Triyaya Tours to anyone who considers traveling around on Sumatra.\nJanneke R",

And above all a fantastic driver (Juwl). We started in Medan (Deli River Hotel \u2013 3 nights). Went via Tuk-Tuk on the Samosir Island (Tabo Cottages \u2013 3 nights) en Betastagi (Grand Mutiari \u2013 1 night) back to the Deli River Hotel again (3 nights). Aspecially the Deli River was a fantastic hotel. An oasis in the middle of a hectic Medan. Nice staff en very good service. Recommendable!!\nI read the comments of other guests and almost everyone had the same experience as we had and gave the maximum appreciation. Except for one guest that had \u2013 we think \u2013 an off-day when he wrote his findings in this site.\n\nDick & Emy van Lochem-van Walsum, april 2013.",

We were told a driver would be waiting for us at the arrivals terminal to meet our internal flight from Banda Aceh. After waiting for twenty minutes we rang the hotel where we told there had been a delay and the driver would be with us in fifteen minutes. Forty minutes later, and an hour after promised, the vehicle finally arrived, with no explanation or apology, despite our young children having to endure constant cigarette smoke on the airport concourse.\nWe complained to the staff on arrival who looked surprised. Eventually a middle-aged European woman [we presume she was the manager although didn't introduce herself] appeared and blamed a previous customer, even though alternative transport could easily have been arranged by the hotel.  Our children were by now too tired to eat their meal. A European man appeared [possibly the owner - again, he didn't introduce himself] and blamed the transport department of the hotel.  To add insult to injury his compensation package involved knocking 20% off the price of the uneaten meals!\nIn summary, left waiting at the airport for an hour with senior staff who didn't seem to care and offered insulting recompense.",

However it is said that greatness is acheived through attention to detail and that is where the Deli River could brush up a little. Although the room was cleaned well enough the bed linen and towels are extremely old and thin and in need of renewing.\n\nThe staff were all pleasant enough, however I must mention Ellie (sorry if that's not the correct spelling) who was by far the most communicative, helpful and friendly. I was disappointed though that much is said about the owners of whom it is said wax lyrical about local history and traditions to their guests but were obviously too preoccupied to have made themselves known to us for the entire three days. Shame because that's a quality I enjoy when travelling.\n\nThat said, I think we were well looked after with good local food and the terrace at the dining room was a pleasant spot to enjoy a couple of cold pre-dinner beers at reasonable prices. I can't comment on Western food, it's not what we go to Indonesia to eat.\n\nWe took a trip from the hotel with their driver (Suriya - once again forgive the spelling if it's wrong) who was a friendly and interesting lad and he gave us a full day out with a good tour of the local area. To anyone who wants a memory to treasure go for the tour to Supiso-Piso Waterfall, impessive by itself after a short walk down the hillside, but the first view you get over the beautiful Lake Toba will stay with us for a very long time.\n\nI also liked a walk out from the hotel as along the road there are a few stalls and eating places and I thought a generally affable place, even a small supermarket (outside, turn right and about 3-5 mins walk) for a few lunchtime provisions or a can or two of chilled beer. The local people mainly wanted to say hello and no-one hassled to sell us anything.\n\nWhen we left it was unfortunately at the ungodly hour of 5.30 in the morning to catch an early flight but the staff gave us an apetising breakfast in a box the night before without us even asking and Suriya was there bang on time to take us to the airport.\n\nOverall I would rate Sumatra as one of the more pleasant Indonesian places we have visited and one to which, one day, we would gladly return. Would we stay at the Deli River again? Well yes we probably would.",

The pickup and transfer from the heaving masses of Medan Airport was spot on. There is wifi in the room and in the restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant always features fresh cooking and the prices are reasonable for Medan. It caters for both local and European food and having had 6 lunches and 6 dinners we did not run out of options. We like our toast done quite well. Having asked once it was always served just as we like it. We were pleasantly surprised by our final restaurant and laundry bill. \n\nA small fly in the ointment was the inability to pay by UK credit card. The problem lies in the restaurant/reception somewhere. We called our bank to make sure that we were not at fault.\n\nWe would definitely stay here again on a future trip.\n\nPs Make sure you also have a meal at Tip Top restaurant in Medan and take your camera.",

Booked a tour with Trijaya, they were helpful in booking domestic flights which was a plus.  However,once in Sumatra our experiences with the tour company was disappointing.  First our driver provided by the company was  aloof, spoke no English and did not assist with luggage. It was also quite frustrating most of the time because there was little communication. Once we arrived at our first destination the elephant reserve, the lodge had no idea we were arriving and had to make adjustments. We met other guests at the lodges that were from other tours and the service they received was far more superior to the service we receive from Trijaya. Despite our frustrations, we found the elephant and orangutan reserves lovely and the staff and guides in both of these locations fantastic.",

We had booked your room at the elephant centre otherwise you would not have got a room. This is because you were there during the peak season Christmas holiday.We are happy that you were satisfied with the local guides that we had arranged for you. Concerning hotel Deli River, as we are an eco-friendly family hotel we have chosen a location in the midst of the Sumatran jungle. This implicates that we are not located nearby the town centre. Thank you very much for your constructive comments.\r\nRegards, \r\nManagement of Hotel Deli River and Tri Jaya Tour and Travel",

Travelling with my sister to the country where our parents and we ourselves were born was a first time experience for me. As we wanted to visit all the places where we had lived this was quite a search after 50 years! But our driver Erwin was absolutely fantastic- he drove us everywhere, finding all the rubber estates, which sometimes took hours to get to. Of all the houses we had lived in sadly only one we found still there. But what an incredible feeling it was to run into the garden and feel that you had come home! And to go and have an ice cream in Tip Top just like in the old days. And visiting Lake Toba where we used to go to on vacation as children. \nI want to thank our driver and the owners of Hotel Deli River for making all this possible. It was an unforgettable experience.\nAnd oh yes, the Indonesian food at the Deli River is fantastic and absolutely authentic , just as we remember it.",

The staff are all very sweet and kind and will go out of their way to make your stay unforgettable and thoroughly enjoyable.  Out of the hustle and bustle of Medan city - you find this place between the trees in a tropical garden. Eating, drinking, to relax in, this place has everything travellers need. The rooms are comfortable, and as clean as could possibly be. I would recommend Hotel Deli River to any who travel need Medan. From Hotel Deli River you can organise your next tour, trip or adventure. Just relaxing by the magnificent pool was enough for me to not want to return home very soon.",

Could be better, since the price of for example the swiss Bell hotel isn't that far of.\nBut, cottages are great with relaxing views over the huge pont and outside busy Medan.\nThe owners and staff are very helpfull and knowledgable about Sumatra.\nThey also run a tourist office and are able to book your trip to your needs and wishes.\n\nAt the Same time that is what we found to be the only downside.\nWe booked a five day trip with them, and all was taken care of ... Well.\nAlthough... We recommend you to try and be adventurous... book everything yourself.\nA car and driver can be found easily, hotels and guides also.\nYou pay less and most importantly the locals get more money as they would trought travel agencies.\n\nFoodwise, this place offers lokal and Western food prapared in Western style kitchen ;-)\n\nTip: Medan is nicer than most people discribe. \nFirst time Asia travelers will find that this city is too busy and dirty, but people are friendly and just want to know about you and were you come from.\nMedan has few tourist sites.\n\nTaxi back to the hotel... Get a Becak. Hotels will overcharge you and again the driver gets just a little share.\n\nThe Deli river hotel is a great choice if you don't mind a 20 minute drive to downtown city Medan.",

              "text": "We went to Medan for only one purpose: Lake Toba. Hence, we went straight to Lake Toba on the day we arrived. However, we did stay at Medan on our last day. \nThe hectic traffic in Medan is driving me crazy. I am so glad that after our 3D2N peaceful trip at Samosir Island, we stayed at Hotel Deli River instead of any other hotels at the city center. We decided to spend our last day enjoying this hotel :)\nIt sits at a peaceful village. You can hear birds chipping and roosters crowing at the break of dawn. \nAll the hotel rooms facing a lovely pond. Our room is very clean and comfortable. It is very cozy sitting at the balcony, with the view of pond and lovely garden. \nI love their restaurant. The food served are real good! You really have to try their juicy sate :)We had continental breakfast the next morning. Our table is setup nicely near the pond. The breakfast came with local fruits, fresh fruit juice, eggs, toast, cheese, jam etc. We had great time chit chat over the breakfast table. \nOh, and I love the swimming pool too. It made me feel like swimming at a private pool :)  \n\nHowever, for those that wish to see Medan city, this hotel may not be suitable. It is a bit far off from city of Medan and the airport (It cost us 80,000 rupiah to travel from hotel to airport by taxi). Worse is, not many taxi drivers in Medan actually heard of this hotel before. We had trouble getting to the hotel on the night we came back from Lake Toba because the taxi driver didn't know the way and he had to drive us to his office to check with other drivers. None of them heard of this hotel before, they were guided by the hotel workers through phone.",

The rooms had inter-connectig doors and were perfectly comfortable.  We enjoyed some of the best food we ate in Sumatra at the restaurant and enjoyed conversations with the friendly staff and owners.  Our children loved the pool, the flying fox and the beautiful plants and flowers in the lovely garden.  We all enjoyed our trips to and from Medan in a becak.",

              "text": "We booked this hotel based on its excellent reviews. We came in during a violent thunderstorm after a long day's journey from Lake Toba, and were a little surprised at the isolated setting and grassy driveway and deserted parking lot. However, it soon became apparent that we were in good hands.\n\nThe staff consists of several very bright university coeds apparently associated with the Omlandia Student Society. They showed a combination of easy competence and friendliness that had us settled comfortably sipping a cool beverage with supper ordered and arrangements made for airport transport next day within ten minutes of arrival.\n\nThe food was exceptionally good. We ordered Javanese dishes, and the size of the portions and elegance of the presentation matched the brilliant use of spices. Our included continental breakfast the next morning featured fruit, fruit juice, eggs, toast, cheese, jam, and a pot of very good coffee, so we headed to the airport in good trim.\n\nOur room was in a building across the fish pond from the restaurant. It had both fan and AC, cable TV, good lighting, and reliable hot water. We slept well in the comfortable beds until and after the call to prayer, with no other sound to disturb our rest. Try that in downtown Medan!\n\nOur hotel-arranged transportation was there early, and despite the heavy 0800 traffic, he got us to the airport in a half hour, so unless you have shopping or business to do in noisy, dirty Medan, staying in this quiet area doesn't add much time to your airport commute.\n\nThis is a good hotel that is different from anywhere else we've ever stayed in Indonesia. If we're in Medan again, it will be our first choice.",

We were met at the airport as arranged and when we got to the Deli River there was no fuss - staff showed us to our rooms (with check-in left to the next morning). Lovely. Our rooms were very comfortable, clean, the bedding and towels perfectly fine. With efficient and welcome air-conditioning.  The next morning the breakfast table was set on the garden terrace and proved to be the first of a number of excellent meals.  Its true that the Deli is out of town,  in a flight path, and the call to prayer can be heard. But we all agreed these were both minor, and in some ways welcome - the call to prayer especially was not a static riven yell but rather beautiful, and as for the flight path we have stayed in Sanur Bali - now there is a flight path! All in all a great choice we returned there after our Aceh trip and were made welcome.  I have to add that for children (and adults) the pool is a joy beautiflly clean perfect - and last of all the flying fox! The children almost refused to leave. Deanna and Dirk and their staff provide a perfect haven from which to explore the wonders that are Sumatra!",

              "text": "There were 6 families in our group (13 adults, 10 children) when we visited Medan. We occupied 6 out of 8 rooms available at this hotel. We just put up a night here. Its quite a distance from town, so if you plan to go shopping at Pasar Ikan, I would not recommend you to stay here. With the heavy traffic and the narrow roads, it can easily take 45 minutes to get to town.\n\nWe stayed here because shopping was not our main itinerary. We needed a place to unwind after a tiring journey from Brastagi. \n\nBasic rooms but clean and spacious. Every room has a balcony. The kids loved the swimming pool and the flying fox. Not many activities here so if you need that adrenaline rush, dont stay here. Good internet connection.\n\nFood - nothing to shout about but the fried rice for breakfast was good. We tried poffertjes and loved it. Coffee making facilities, tv are available in every room.\n\nWe were not satisfied with the minibus Tri Jaya provided. The minibus could only accomodate 24 people. There were already a driver, a tour guide and a co-driver in the minibus. The minibus was so small, it was so difficult to move around in the minibus. There was 1 kind of smell in the minibus, aircond very noisy, faulty brakes. Blessing in disguise when the minibus broke down on the way from Brastagi to Medan, they replaced with a new and bigger bus.\n\nThe tour guide did ask for tips after the tour ended, if I am not mistaken Rp350,000. If you want to buy Bika Ambon, you can do so at the airport, no need to order from the tour guide as the price is cheaper at the airport.\n\nOverall, Tri Jaya did a good job, would definitely recommend friends to book with them.",

The setting was lovely, the pool was wonderful, the rooms were clean and well organised, and the staff were absolutely delightful. Free WiFi was good, and the restaurant was excellent (which was lucky, since it's the only restaurant accessible on foot!). All services offered were as promised. We were very happy with our stay and would definitely stay again.",

              "text": "My wife and I visited the hotel in November and we have nothing, but good to say about the hotel and the service.  The hotel is a lovely haven of peace in comparison to the hectic city outside. The rooms were bright and clean, the restaurant served delicious Dutch and Indonesian food, breakfast was served overlooking the duck pond, the perfect way to start the day. There was also the added advantage of the swimming pool, perfect after a trip into the jungle! We found the staff to be very polite and helpful and English was spoken.  Yes, we did hear the Call to Prayer at 5am, but this is Indonesia and it confirmed we were in an exotic land..and not back home in an English winter.\nWe also booked with Trijaya Tours and I would highly recommend their tours. Our driver (Welly) was excellent, good english, great sense of humour and we felt very safe on the roads at all times. We did 2 trips, Bukit Lawang and Lake Toba staying the Deli River before, in-between and after the tours which allowed us to relax a little.  Sumatra is an adventure and the Hotel deli River offers a nice bit of luxury and their tour company offers tours to suit your length of stay with your driver and own vehicle.\nThanks too for Diana and Dirk who were often on hand to ask about our tours and offer advice.\n\nWe hope to stay again.\nMartin and Sue\n\nPS If anyone has Welly as their driver on the Lake toba tour, please feel free to mention the Loch Ness Monster at some stage. He will enjoy it.",

Deli River is a high standard, pretty, beautifully situated, colonial style hotel, providing excellent services. It is a pleasant spot to recover from all travel stress before getting on wheels again.\n\nAs I was born in North Sumatra before WW-2 and never returned to this area, this trip intended to  put faces to names, such as Pangkalan Brandan (my place of birth), Brastagi, Prapat, Lake Toba, etc. \nWho else better that Dirk Buiskool, historian and owner of the hotel, could act as sounding board and reliable source of information.\nA two day trip to the Orangutan reserve in Bukit Lawang was an exciting and interesting addition to all nostalgic considerations and experiences\n\nThe tour itself, organized by Tri Jaya Travel, also managed and owned by Dirk Buiskool and his wife Diana, was a great success and fully met our touristic and nostalgic expectations.\nTiming of distances (no driving after sunset), excursions, hotels and our personal wishes were well considered. We got a high standard car and our driver, Youl, contributed highly to this enjoyable trip, not just by his safe driving (as traffic can be quite erratic), but also by his pleasant company and good advice.\n\nWe can highly recommend services of both Hotel Deli River and Tri Jaya Travel",

The fact that hotel owner Dirk Buiskool is a Dutch historian with extensive knowledge of Medan's colonial past certainly helped me in chosing this hotel but it was especially the favourable reviews on this website. \nAnd I was not disappointed! \nThe beautiful garden is a feast for the eye as well as the spirit. The rooms are charming and clean. The staff are friendly and efficient. Unlike some reviewers I thought the food was excellent but I only had the Indonesian / Chinese dishes. Frankly, I don't understand the logic behind eating European food when travelling in Asia. Try Deli River's egg roll and you will be hooked for life!\nYou can describe every single aspect of this hotel and judge it, but for me it all comes down to one thing: atmosphere. The owners have managed to create a combination of professionalism and homeliness. Quite unique in my view. Hotel Deli River is a home away from home.",

              "text": "As other reviews already stated: The hotel is a beautiful estate in maybe the most beautiful place you could find in Medan: In the outskirts of the city, some 5km south of the airport, built on a hill at the shore of Deli river (as the name suggests). It is a very beautiful hide-away, especially for families with smaller children: there is a small playground, a beautiful pool-side and some (well-walled) terrain to explore. Nothing of this you would find in the city hotels; and if you stay in Medan only coming from or going to the airport, it may be a good choice. But there are quite a few \"but\"s. First: For a hotel aimed mostly at European guests, the cuisine is sub-standard. We had a really aweful Cordon Bleu and an even more aweful NZ tenderloin steak. The Indonesian food they serve, is better, but the Western style meals are not worth the money. Second: The place is beautiful, but the rooms are not quite as good as you can get for the same money in, say, the Swiss-Belhotel or the Grand Aston. Not to be misunderstood: The rooms are o.k. (AC, TV, clean, nice and good furniture, en-suite-bathrooms ...), but they are not 5-star, 3+ at the best. Especially the bathrooms could need an upgrade soon. Third: If your travel plans include a visit of Medan city (which can be quite interesting if you know where to look), you need between 45-75 minutes to get there - one way! 4th: Unlike you might expect, the noise level is HIGHER than in any 5-star-city hotel! Why? The hotel is located directly in the approach path of Medan airport, so you have 4 or 5 planes per hour going directly over your head during daytime. Fortunately, there are no nightly take-offs. And: There is a mosque directly at the other side of the river - which can be very annoying, esp. at 4 o'clock in the morning. If you stay in one of the upper floors of one of the city hotels, you have much better isolated rooms high above the city's noise level.\nThe service is good, as you could expect in that class of hotel: Well trained and very friendly staff (which is already something for Indonesia!).\n\nOur experience is quite mixed, and our recommendation is not without some limitations. If you know what to look for and what you can expect, it is ok.",

It is out of town and away from all the traffic but it is also on the main flight path! The free internet is a nice touch but the rooms are expensive for what you get. We booked a triple room for the night. In my e-mail correspondance I was assured there was three separate beds as we were 3 friends travelling together. When shown out room one bed was a matress on the floor. Having said that the rooms were very clean, with pleasing decor. However, there was no firdge in the room and no tea or coffee making facilities and even at a reduced rate of 98 USD I think this is too expensive for sumartra. \nThe resturant they boast about serves over priced very average food. Drinks are also expensive and as you have no fridge, and no tea or coffee facilities in your room or anywhere to buy things you have to get them from the hotel. Breakfast was included in the price and the fresh toasted bread with jams and some cheese was really lovely, we were given hard boiled eggs (a choice of how you wanted your eggs would be nice) plus fresh tea or coffee.\n\nHotel staff tried hard to answer my questions but had very little english. The owners, who I think were dutch, were nowhere to be seen. This hotel could be really good if it added a few more touches or charged a bit less!",

Beautiful grounds, lovely architecture, friendly hosts (Diana and Dirk) - the pictures at te hotel website, lovely as they are, don't really do it justice.  The proprietors Diana and Dirk will organize your trip in advance, just tell them what you your interests are by email.  From here you can visit Lake Toba, Mt. Leuserk, go river rafting, walk to a nearby archeological site.  The atmosphere is wonderful - music wafting out of the open air lounge when a visiting pianist takes a turn at the great-sounding new Yamaha upright.  Beautiful main building and lovely quity comfortable CLEAN!!! rooms.",

              "text": "Voor de laatste dagen van onze vakantie zochten we een hotel waar we zouden kunnen ontspannen en dat is zeker gelukt bij hotel Deli River. Superschoon, prachtig onderhouden, ontzettend leuke meiden in de bediening, heerlijk zwembad. Fantastische keuken. Kortom niets te klagen. Als we dan toch iets te zeuren moeten hebben: we hadden een kraakbed en de stoelen bij het zwembad kon je niet in ligstand doen. Maar dit zijn echt punten waar we naar moeten zoeken. Tip: reserveer de massage. Dit is een soort social help programma (het hotel verdient niets aan de massage, je betaalt rechtstreeks aan deze mensen) De massage wordt gedaan door een blind echtpaar. Eerst denk je: wat dit moet worden maar dit is echt een hele stevige massage, in je eigen hotelkamer. Tijdens de massage denk je: is dit leuk maar na de massage voel je je echt als herboren! Aanrader!!",

              "text": "Onze reis naar Sumatra en Java, een reis die we in februari 2020 maakten, begon met een verblijf in hotel Deli River in Medan. Net als onze eerste reis die we maakten in 2012. Het was als thuiskomen in dit paradijsje in Medan. Ga je het terrein op dan laat je de drukte van de straat meteen achter je. Natuurlijk hoor je wel de oproepen van de moskee\u00ebn in de omgeving, maar die hoorden we in alle (zeven) hotels waar we gedurende deze uitgebreide reis overnacht hebben.\nVeel waardering ook voor Restaurant De Ommelanden, behorend bij Hotel Deli River en reisbureau Tri Jaya. Vriendelijke en correcte bediening, heerlijk eten en een uiterst redelijke prijs. Veel respect hebben we voor de manier waarop het hotel en het restaurant plaatselijke krachten inzet en die een persoonlijke opleiding geeft, bijvoorbeeld in het Engels spreken.",

Het restaurant Omlandia van Hotel Deli River is gebouwd \nin een mix van locale Batak Simalungun arcitectuur gecombineerd met een koloniale bouwstijl wat vooral tot uiting komt in het veelvuldig gebruik van houten jaloezieen waardoor het geheel een sfeer van \u2018tempe doeloe\u2019 (sfeer van vroeger) ademt. Het restaurant is een open milieuvriendelijke constructie gebouwd op een hoogte naast de Deli rivier vallei waardoor er een  aangenaam bries je waait en dus minder warm. Hotel Deli River streeft naar een  eco vriendelijk concept met gebruik van zonne energie, herbruikbare waterflessen en zo weinig mogelijk plastic. We zijn blij dat u ons hotel zo waardeert. Na \nhet verblijf in ons hotel heeft u een reis gemaakt met Tri Jaya Tour & Travel en we zijn blij  dat alles zo goed is verlopen. Management Hotel Deli River en Tri Jaya Tour & Travel.",

Wij hadden het als aankomst verblijf na onze vlucht vanaf Amsterdam. Omdat we al vroeg in de ochtend waren geland waren we om 07.00 al in het hotel. Hoewel het hotel zo goed als leeg was, konden we nog geen kamers krijgen en hielden ze vast aan de incheck tijd van 14.00\nUiteindelijk kregen we om 11.00 alsnog de sleutels.\nDer kamers zijn goed en voorzien van alle nodige zaken zoals koelkast en airco.\nHet ontbijt was goed, de eerste ochtend was het nog in buffetvorm en een ruime keuze. De 2e dag waren wij de enige 8 gasten en daarom moesten we van te voren aangeven wat we bij het ontbijt wilde hebben. Hierdoor iets minder keuze, maar begrijpelijk ivm met voedselverspilling.\nOmdat er niet in de directe omgeving een restaurant zit, hebben we gebruik gemaakt van het bijbehorende restaurant Omlandia. De keuze is ruim voldoende, en smaakt ook goed.\nWe hebben de bitterballen niet geprobeerd. De eigenaar is van Nederlandse afkomst.",

Oktober er \u00e5benbart lavs\u00e6son i Medan, s\u00e5 vi var stort set de eneste p\u00e5 hotellet. \nStedet er som en lille oase, n\u00e5r man forlader vejen. Vi boede i et af v\u00e6relserne med udsigt over s\u00f8en i midten. Smukt sted. Maden var god og veltilberedt. Swimmingpoolen var helt fantastisk til b\u00f8rnene, da der var lavt vand i den ene ende. Og s\u00e5 sidst, men ikke mindst, s\u00e5 var personalet ekstremt s\u00f8de og hj\u00e6lpsomme. Vi kan kun anbefale andre, som s\u00f8ger stilhed og idyl at bo p\u00e5 hotellet. Mange hilsner L\u00e6rke, Jarl, Flora og Felix fra Roskilde, Danmark.",

Het ontbijt was magertjes en niet bijzonder. Ik zou er geen cappuccino bestellen want ze gebruiken er geen gewone melk en daardoor is de smaak ondefinieerbaar en zoet. Je hoort er diverse imams door hun megafoons tetteren en dat vonden wij minder prettig. Prima verblijf voor doorreis maar ik zou niet weten waarom ik hier langer dan een nacht zou willen verblijven.",

Tijdens het ontbijt hebben onze medewerksters Syaffitri en Lala 2 keer gevraagd of u nog nog meer wilde maar u zei dat alles naar wens was.\n \nDe cappuccino die u heeft gekregen was uit een sachet omdat de espresso koffie machine op dat moment even buiten gebruik was. Syaffriti heeft u verteld dat de echte espresso niet kon worden aangeboden maar dat u gratis cappuccino uit een sachet, inclusief suiker en melk, kon krijgen wat u accepteerde. Op dat moment was dit de enige optie. Het was dus niet de normale espresso koffie die wij serveren en u werd hierover tevoren ge\u00efnformeerd.\n \nBetreffende moskee in de omgeving, u bevond zich in een land waar meer dan 90% van de bevolking moslem is en waar tijdens de vastenmaand, toen u er verbleef, meerdere keren per dag een oproep gedaan tot gebed. Dit geldt dus met name tijdens de vastenmaand, niet tijdens andere maanden. Noord Sumatra staat bekend om haar culturele, etnische en religieuze verscheidenheid waar Hindoe, Boedisten, Christenen en Islamieten vredig samenleven. Het gebied is een voorbeeld van tolerantie en wederzijds begrip. Wij hopen dat onze gasten hier eveneens begrip voor hebben.\n \nHotel Deli River is een kleinschalig familie hotel in een tropische tuin. Voor verder commentaar verwijzen wij graag naar andere reacties op Tripadvisor. Management Hotel Deli River.\n ",

Alle kamers zijn voorzien van airco, die heel slim is gemonteerd, waardoor je nergens in de \"waai\" zit of ligt. Mooi, ruim zwembad. Het personeel is buitengewoon vriendelijk en zeer behulpzaam. Het restaurant viel wat tegen. De kaart is beperkt en komt niet verder dan de meest gangbare gerechten, naast poffertjes, broodje kroket en bitterballen, dat dan weer wel. Kan eraan gelegen hebben dat we er waren in het laagseizoen.",

Das Restaurant und der Fr\u00fchst\u00fccksbereich sowie der wundersch\u00f6ne Pool sind r\u00e4umlich durch einen Teich von den Geb\u00e4uden mit den insgesamt 14 Hotel Zimmern getrennt. Die Zimmer sind individuell sehr geschmackvoll mit angenehmer Klimaanlage und warm Wasser Dusche ausgestattet.\nDie Betreuung durch das Personal und die Eigent\u00fcmer ist vorbildlich.\nDas Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck und Essen im Restaurant ist sehr gut.\nDas Hotel ist etwas au\u00dferhalb von Medan in einem sch\u00f6nen Umfeld gelegen. Man hat das Gef\u00fchl mitten im Regenwald zu wohnen. F\u00fcr den Transfer zum Flughafen, der nur 50 min gedauert hat, hatten wir den Service des Hotels f\u00fcr 250.000 IDR gebucht.\nPreis Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis ist f\u00fcr alles aus unserer Sicht passend.",

Zowel een Europese/Ned als Indonesische keuken. Opgezet door een Ned Indonesisch echtpaar die met passie bezig zijn met hun gasten, hotel en hun personeel. Ze organiseren tevens trips en reizen met hun reisbureau Trijaja travel. Ideale lokatie om trips naar Bukit Lawang, Berastagi etc af te wisselen met de rust vh hotel. Specialiteit van de gastheer is de historie van Medan en Sumatra.Ik heb veel uit zijn boekje gehaald over koloniale tijden en ben via hem achter specifieke adressen van mijn vader gekomen die in Medan geboren is. Ze organiseren oa 4 historische tours. Nostalgia! Een aanrader ook buiten het toeristen seizoen.",

Das Check-in war unkompliziert und ein Begr\u00fcssunggetr\u00e4nk wurde ebenfalls angeboten. Die Mitarbeiter/innen sind alle sehr freundlich, zuvorkommend und machen fast alles m\u00f6glich. Im Deli River wird darauf geachtet Plastik zu vermeiden. Im Zimmer gibt es nicht wie in anderen Hotels Plastik-Trinkflaschen, sondern eine Hart-Plastikflasche, welche t\u00e4glich oder auf Verlangen aufgef\u00fcllt wird. Das Zimmer war f\u00fcr indonesische Verh\u00e4ltnisse sehr sauber, liebevoll eingerichtet mit Blumendeko aus dem eigenen Hausgarten. Die Gartenanlage wird t\u00e4glich liebevoll gepflegt. \nWir buchten eine Massage, welche im Zimmer stattfand und durch ein blindes Ehepaar durchgef\u00fchrt wurde. Wir hatten schon in unz\u00e4hligen L\u00e4ndern Massagen und wir k\u00f6nnen sagen, dass diese Massage im Deli River zu den Top 3 geh\u00f6rt, welche wir je hatten!\nFlughafen-Shuttle: F\u00fcr 19 Euro f\u00fcr ca. 1 Stunde Fahrt vom oder zum Flughafen, bietet das Deli River einen Shuttle an. \nDas Morgenessen wird auf der Terrasse eingenommen. Es ist reichhaltig und schmackhaft, Kaffee, Saft, Eier, Pfannkuchen, Kokosgeb\u00e4ck, Toast, K\u00e4se, Butter, hausgemachte Konfit\u00fcre, etc. werden serviert.\nIn der Umgebung gibt es unz\u00e4hlige kleine einheimische L\u00e4den, 100m entfernt einen Alfamarkt mit ATM.\nWer eine kleine Oase mit Pool Und eigenem Restaurant (sehr zu empfehlen) ausserhalb Medan sucht, dann ist das Deli River das Richtige.\nVielen lieben Dank an das ganze Deli River Team f\u00fcr den angenehmen Aufenthalt.

              "text": "Als wir angekommen sind w\u00fcrden wir in der Lobby mit einem Willkommensdrink empfangen.\nDa wir unseren Aufenthalt verl\u00e4ngerten (da wir Lombok leider canceln mussten aufgrund der Erdbeben) mussten wir die zus\u00e4tzlichen 3 Tage direkt bei der Ankunft bezahlen.\nDanach wurden unsere Koffer zum Zimmer gebracht. Leider fiel direkt auf das kein K\u00fchlschrank vorhanden war, indem wir unsere eigenen Getr\u00e4nke kalt stellen wollten, aber die Frau von der Rezeption hat sofort eine L\u00f6sung gesucht und wir konnten die Getr\u00e4nke in den K\u00fchlschrank der Restaurantk\u00fcche unterbringen. \nAm n\u00e4chsten Tag hatten wir kurz die Gelegenheit mit dem Hotelbesitzer zu sprechen da er auf uns zukam und fragte ob alles okay sei und wo wir her kommen. Wir haben ihm mitgeteilt dass ein K\u00fchlschrank fehlte und er wusste nichts davon und wird sich wohl darum k\u00fcmmern. (So seine Worte.)\n\nDie Zimmer sind sehr einfach gehalten und die Betten aus Bambus. Das Einzelbett im Nebenraum war leider schon sehr wackelig, sodass man Angst hatte das es jeden Moment zusammen kracht wenn man sich drauf legt.\nKleiderschr\u00e4nke - Fehlanzeige. Nur eine Garderobe, die definitiv nicht f\u00fcr das ganze Gep\u00e4ck von 3 Personen reicht.\nAls wir am ersten Tag von unserem Tagestrip wieder kamen waren die Zimmer NICHT gemacht. Die Betten waren nicht gemacht und die Handt\u00fccher die wir am Morgen auf den Boden geworfen haben zum wechseln lagen noch immer da.\nAls wir dann in der Lobby nachgefragt haben wurde uns gesagt das wir denen die Erlaubnis h\u00e4tten geben m\u00fcssen. Das wussten wir \u00fcberhaupt nicht da es sonst immer selbstverst\u00e4ndlich gemacht wurde in anderen Hotels.\n\nDas Badezimmer ist l\u00e4nglich, allerdings - ein riesengro\u00dfer negativer Punkt - es ist oben offen. Die Wand ist nicht bis nach oben gezogen sodass man alles h\u00f6ren kann was derjenige im Bad gerade macht & durch das Eckdach schallt es auch ziemlich. Wenn jemand ein gr\u00f6\u00dferes Gesch\u00e4ft macht mussten andere raus gehen, au\u00dfer es st\u00f6rt die Personen nicht. Das finde ich ein absolutes no Go und ist ein Punkt, wieso ich dieses Hotel nicht wieder buchen w\u00fcrde.\n\nDer Pool ist sehr sch\u00f6n und auch angenehm warm, allerdings sehr klein und nicht so gro\u00df wie er vielleicht auf Fotos wirkt. \nSchuhe (Flipflops) muss man vor einem Gitter ausziehen bevor man \u00fcberhaupt in die N\u00e4he des Pools gelangt.\n\nIm Hoteleigenen Restaurant ist es wirklich sehr lecker und absolut zu empfehlen. \nDas Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck ist sehr klein. Es gibt Mie Goreng mit Glasnudeln (wenig gew\u00fcrzt) Fr\u00fchlingsrollen, Poffertjes, S\u00fc\u00dfgeb\u00e4ck und Toast, dazu Marmelade und K\u00e4se und Obst.\nDer Saft war wirklich widerlich, undefinierbar und einen ganz merkw\u00fcrdigen Nachgeschmack. Der Kaffee und der Tee waren aber sehr gut! \n\nRund um das Hotel sind keine Restaurants (nur einheimische kleine St\u00e4nde an denen es aber auch gut schmeckt).\n\nEine Ruheoase wie es einige beschreiben ist es allerdings nicht. Direkt bei der Ankunft wurden wir von gef\u00fchlt allen Moscheen aus Medan empfangen und das fast st\u00fcndlich & diese sind wirklich SEHR laut, auch beim Abendessen war es unertr\u00e4glich, sodass wir uns kaum unterhalten konnten. Selbst in der City direkt wo wir davor im Hotel waren war es nicht so laut wie es hier ist.\n\nDas WLAN vor Ort ist eine Vollkatastrophe. Es reicht GERADE SO f\u00fcr WhatsApp aber auch nur schreiben. Fotos laden ewig und Videos laden ist unm\u00f6glich. Videos HOCHLADEN auf YouTube ging null. Wollte man etwas googeln m\u00fcsste man ca 1-2 Minuten warten bis die Seite sich aufgebaut hat. \n\nMein pers\u00f6nliches Fazit: Das Hotel ist zwar sch\u00f6n und auch sehr sauber, allerdings sprechen zu viele Punkte dagegen, als das ich nochmal dieses Hotel buchen w\u00fcrde.",

              "text": "Dekli River is een prima hotel voor een paar dagen, net buiten het drukke Medan. Schone, ruime kamers en al het personeel is buitengewoon vriendelijk. Ook de Nederlandse eigenaren zijn zeer behulpzaam om je te helpen met bv excursie naar Medan. Er is een heerlijk zwembad bij om af te koelen. Op de kamers is een f\u00f6hn, toiletartikelen en er is koffie en thee. Het ontbijt is ook goed je kunt bestellen wat je wilt. Het eten is echt heerlijk, de keuken is open en erg schoon. S'avonds om 21uur sluit alles en in het weekend om 22uur. Maar je bent dan moe genoeg door de warmte en alle indrukken. Buiten het hotel is er niets om naartoe te gaan of eruit te lopen dus voor ons waren 2 dagen genoeg om bij te komen van de lange reis.\nWij hebben de tweede dag de Heritage toer gedaan naar Medan en dat was een goede keuze, heel erg interessant. Je krijgt een boek mee zodat je mee kunt kijken als de gids verteld over de gebouwen van vroeger, echt een aanrader. We hebben onze reis vervolgd naar Bukit lawang en konden onze bagage bij het hotel laten staan omdat je daar niet veel nodig hebt en je bijna altijd voor doorreis via Medan moet gaan dus kun je het dan weer ophalen. Goed geregeld.",

Het ontbijt wordt geserveerd en is heerlijk! Wat een genot om je reis hier af te sluiten. Het zwembad lijkt wat op een infinitypool, maar het uitzicht is niet zo denderend. Maakt niet uit, want het blijft heerlijk om te zwemmen en genieten, omringd door tropische planten. De kamers zijn erg goed. Lekkere bedden en een heerlijke douche!! Wat fijn om een volle warmwaterdouche te kunnen nemen na 2 weken koud water, of zeer beperkt warm. De airco is ook lekker. Ze hebben de airco niet naar het bed gericht, maar aan de zijkant van de kamer naar de muur. Zo krijg je niet alle lucht rechtstreeks in je gezicht, beperkt de kans op verkoudheid e.d. werkelijk heerlijk verblijf gehad. Aanrader! ",

Ein wundersch\u00f6nes Hotel mit sehr sauberen Zimmern, jedes mit AC, grossen B\u00e4dern in westlichem Standard und sch\u00f6nem Balkon mit Sicht auf die wundersch\u00f6ne gepflegte Gartenanlage. Die Besitzer sowie die gesamte Staff leisten hier eine hervorragende Arbeit und kommen den G\u00e4sten freundlich und sehr hilfsbereit bei jedem Anliegen entgegen. Das Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck sowie auch die Menues sind vielseitig und lecker zubereitet. Ein Pool mit Sicht auf den Deli River l\u00e4sst einen den Grossstadtdschungel vor der T\u00fcre vergessen. Die Besitzer f\u00fchren ein zum Hotel geh\u00f6rendes Reiseb\u00fcro und organisieren innerhalb k\u00fcrzester Zeit Touren in Sumatra oder innerhalb ganz Indonesien, ganz individuell auf die W\u00fcnsche der G\u00e4ste zugeschnitten. Ein sehr guter Platz um seine Reise zu starten, den Jetlag zu \u00fcberwinden oder seine R\u00fcckreise vorzubereiten. Wir m\u00f6chten dieses Hotel unbedingt weiterempfehlen.",

Das Personal ist \u00fcberaus freundlich und zuvorkommend, nahezu jeder Wunsch wird erf\u00fcllt. Und das gilt sowohl f\u00fcr Security, K\u00fcche als auch das Office. Die beiden Besitzer wohnen auf dem Gel\u00e4nde und ich hatte Gelegenheit, am Abend mit einem von ihnen zu sprechen. Sehr angenehm und definitiv eine Bereicherung. \u00dcber die interne Reiseagentur lassen sich Touren in die Umgebung, z.B. zum Gunung Leuser Nationalpark oder zum Lake Toba buchen. Auch gr\u00f6\u00dfere Touren k\u00f6nnen organisiert werden.\nDie Zimmer sind ger\u00e4umig, inkl. Klimaanlage und Balkon mit Blick auf den herrlichen Garten. Das Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck ist herausragend, mit Fr\u00fcchten aus dem Garten und jeden Tag ein wenig anders, auf Wunsch auch vegetarisch. Ebenso sind die anderen Speisen des angebundenen Restaurants zu empfehlen.\nVom Pool aus schaut man auf den Fluss und kann dabei vergessen, dass drau\u00dfen die Gro\u00dfstadt tobt. Sehr empfehlenswert und herzlichen Dank f\u00fcr alles! ",

Daarnaast de traditionele Indische keuken.\nEen echte aanrader.",

Zowel de kamer, het restaurant, het zwembad en het personeel waren voortreffelijk. De vriendelijkheid en behulpzaamheid waren erg goed. In een woord geweldig. Door het goede contact met ook de eigenaren hebben wij niet alleen een groot gedeelte van onze vakantie daar verder geregeld en laten verzorgen maar ook een Jungle Hash run met eigenaar Dirk meegedaan. Hij is lid van de \"Sunday Hash House Harriers\" een groep Chinees-Indonesische Hash runners die wekelijks twee maal een run doen door de Jungle. Dit was dan ook ons eerste hoogtepunt van onze eerste dagen op Sumatra. Een echte aanrader om zowel met lokale bewoners als de Jungle kennis te maken.  Dank voor de hartelijkheid en ons thuis te voelen in jullie paradijs.",

              "text": "Na een lange reis van ruim 24 uur stond er een taxi voor ons bij de luchthaven, geregeld door Deli River, ruim een uur later (het was erg druk op de weg), stapten wij onze heerlijke kamer binnen. Ons bestelde diner en gekoelde (koelbox) drankjes stonden klaar en smaakten ons goed na de lange vlucht.\nWe hebben twee nachten heerlijk geslapen, we zijn niet buiten de muren van het hotel geweest, maar dat is prima als je hier maar \u00e9\u00e9n hele dag (late aankomst eerste dag, vroeg vertrek derde dag) bent. Lekker zwemmen bij het zwembad met prachtig uitzicht, een heerlijke lunch die we aan een tafeltje bij het zwembad konden nuttigen en een klein middagdutje op de stoelen van onze eigen veranda. Ook het diner smaakte ons erg goed! Eerder werd genoemd dat de prijzen daarvoor erg hoog waren, wij vonden het erg meevallen. Het is een hotel waar je ruim \u20ac50 per nacht voor betaald, dan verwacht je geen restaurant met maaltijden van \u20ac2. Wij betaalden bijvoorbeeld ongeveer \u20ac4,50 voor nasi goreng (met 3 sat\u00e9 stokjes, een gebakken ei, atjar en meer dan genoeg nasi goreng) en ongeveer \u20ac7 voor beef rendang met rijst en atjar. Meer dan prima voor deze kwaliteit, de goede service en het prachtige uitzicht vanuit het restaurant!\nDe kamers zijn schoon, ruim en met warme douche (hoewel er een handiger ophangsysteem voor de douchekop zou moeten zijn), het personeel is vriendelijk, behulpzaam en spreekt prima Engels, kortom een aanrader om te verblijven!",

Een verademing als je niet van de chaotische stad houdt!\n\n- Fijne kamer met airco, prima douche, normale wc en fijn bed. Schoon.\n- Prima zwembad. Niks bijzonders maar wel schoon en groot genoeg.\n- Vriendelijk personeel \n- Goede, vriendelijke taxi chauffeurs\n- Excursie mogelijkheden \n- Vriendelijke Nederlandse eigenaar die af en toe een woordje met je komt spreken. Hij is welwillend om te helpen met een excursie (reselijk) op maat.\n- Lekker ontbijt. Je tafel wordt vol gezet met diversiteit aan ontbijt.\n- Goede Wi-Fi op slaapkamer en in restaurant. Geen bereik bij het zwembad.\n- Enige nadeel: Er zitten geen (westerse) restaurants in de buurt, dus je bent afhankelijk van hun menukaart tenzij je het ervoor over hebt 45 min in de taxi te zitten voor een restaurant in het centrum.\n- Dinerkaart is prima voor 2 avonden wat ons betreft. Er staan zowel Indonesische als Westerse gerechten op. Echter zijn de Westerse hoofdgerechten geen aanrader. De Indonesische zijn wel goed (als dit je smaak is uiteraard).\n- Prijzen zijn prima.\n\nAfstanden:\n- op ruim 1 uur van het vliegveld (overdag)\n- op 30min van het vliegveld (snachts)\n- op 45min van het centrum\n- op 3 uur van Bukit Lawang (wij verbleven in On the Rocks Resort in BW. Ook echte aanrader)\n\nConclusie: dikke aanrader!!",

Das Hotel ist rund eine Stunde vom Flughafen entfernt & bietet die perfekte Oase, um in Sumatra anzukommen, den Jetlag auszuschlafen & sich an alles zu gew\u00f6hnen. Es ist alles nach westlichem Standard eingerichtet & das Personal ist \u00e4usserst freundlich & aufmerksam. Ausserdem sprechen alle sehr gut englisch. \nAuch der Shuttle service zum Flughafen war sehr gut, wir hatten einen sehr guten Fahrer, der trotz der normale Medan Hektik, ruhig & sicher gefahren ist.

We vonden het meteen al een geweldige plek! Daarna maakten we een tour door Noord-Sumatra en toen we terygkwamen, verbleven we opnieuw 2 nachten in het hotel. Alle hotels waar we waren geweest, waren goed tot uitstekend, maar Deli River was echt met afstand het allerbeste hotel. Dat kwam zowel door de geweldige kamer, als door het restaurant en vooral door het geweldige personeel: een en al aandacht en voorkomendheid.",

Wat ons bijgebleven is:\n- Heerlijk groene omgeving met vissen en vogels\n- Heerlijk eten (Zowel ontbijt als dinner)\n- Aardig personeel en een leuke eigenaar\n- Genieten van de rust en natuur\n- Nette kamers voor Indonesische begrippen",

Bediening is erg betrokken en doet enorm haar best.  Zwembad is mooi aangelegd, goed zwemwater, schoon en verzorgd. Mooi uitzicht op Deli River. Iedere dag een ander ontbijt met specialiteiten van het gebied.\n\nEigenaar van het resort en reisbureau Tri Jaya Travel, Dirk Buiskool, heeft een op maat gemaakte reis voor ons opgesteld met priv\u00e9 chauffeur Yoel. Met mijn moeder (87) en dochter (22) hebben we alle plekken bezocht waar mijn moeder is opgegroeid in en rondom Medan, Brastagi en Tobameer. \n\nOok de kampen Pulau Brayan en Glukur hebben we bezocht wat heel veel herinneringen weer naar boven bracht. We hebben alle tijd en ruimte gehad om naar de specifieke plekken van mijn moeders jeugd op zoek te gaan. Echt fantastisch.\n\nOok in Medan hebben we bijv. Hotel De Boer en restaurant Tiptop  en het oude zwembad bezocht.",

              "text": "Na een reis richting bukit lawang wilde we weer even wat rust en luxe. We hebben gekozen voor hotel Deli River. Dit was een goede keuze, omdat we verbleven in een nette en schone kamer die dagelijks werd schoongemaakt. Het eten in het inpandige restaurant Omlandia was goed en er zijn zelfs Nederlandse gerechten op te vinden.\n\nDe eigenaar Dirk (historicus) regelt ook een stedentrip door Medan. Het mooie hiervan is dat hij graag zijn kennis deelt en daardoor een stedentrip net dat stukje extra heeft. De chauffeur heeft door de jaren heen ook wat Nederlands geleerd en is daardoor een aanwinst tijdens de trip...ook heel veel gelachen in de gesprekken over de verschillen tussen de Nederlandse en Indische cultuur.\nAls klap op de vuurpijl zijn we door Dirk uitgenodigd om deel te nemen aan een \" hash\" loop. Dit is een sportactiviteit waarbij je een tocht van ongeveer 5 km door de jungle maakt met een groep. Daarna wordt er gezamenlijk gegeten en gedronken. Deelname was maar een paar euro pp. Diana, de vrouw van Dirk heeft op verzoek van ons wat lekkernijen laten maken door de keuken. Dit was heel verassend..bedankt nog daarvoor!\n\nIn onze beleving is het hotel geschikt voor iedereen die dichtbij de stad wil zijn, maar houdt van een natuurlijke omgeving. Wij hebben ook in hartje medan een hotel gehad, maar dan mis je net die rust, ruimte en natuurlijke omgeving. Het is gemakkelijk om een taxi te laten bestellen door het personeel van deli river en daarna vanuit de stad weer terug te pakken. Mensen met weinig budget raden wij aan om voor een andere accomodatie te kiezen. Hiermee zeggen we zeker niet dat het te duur is, maar eten, drinken, slapen en een taxi kost bij elkaar meer dan gemiddeld. Het nadeel is dat je dan niet zo lekker zit als bij Deli River..:) Een aanrader en mooie afsluiting van onze vakantie.\n\nMocht u vanuit Deli River vervoer nodig hebben naar de luchthaven, dan raden wij u aan om met een normale taxi te gaan. Dit scheelt enorm in de kosten. ",

              "text": "Wij verbleven 10 dagen in hotel Deli River. Iedere ochtend kregen we een uitgebreid ontbijt bestaande uit vers gebakken brood, koffie en thee, verse vruchtensappen, vers fruit, verschillende soorten eigengemaakte cake en omelet of roerei of een gekookt ei. Elke dag werd het ontbijt aangepast zodat we niet 2 dagen achtereen hetzelfde kregen. Ook werd vaak een pannekoek geserveerd en speciale Indonesisische  gevulde rijst hapjes, zoet of hartig, ingepakt in bananenblad. Tijdens ons 10 daags verblijf kregen we elke dag een ander ontbijt dat vaak zo veel was dat we pas in de middag weer trek kregen. De kamers waren smaakvol ingericht met fraaie handgemaakte houten bedden.\n\n Ik verbleef in het hotel met mijn 95 jarige moeder en de service was uitmuntend. Haar kamer had  speciale handicap faciliteiten met extra handgrepen bij de douche. De route van hotel naar restaurant door de prachtige tropische tuin was ingericht op minder validen en er was een aangepast toilet in het restaurant. Het personeel begeleidde mijn moeder van haar kamer naar het restaurant, waar zij ook weer op haar wenken werd bediend. Overal waar ze naar toe ging, bij de kamers, het restaurant en bij het zwembad werd zij begeleid. Een speciale ligbank met extra kussens werd geplaatst zodat ze tussendoor uit kon rusten. De service was uitmuntend.\n\nTerug in Nederland vanuit het warme bad van het tropisch paradijs,\ndenken we terug aan de meer dan vriendelijke lieve ontvangst en verzorging in hotel Deli River op Sumatra. We maakten tochten door de omgeving, het platteland langs de weg naar Pancar Barut en Sibolangit, genoten van de hussle-bussle op straat, de karretjes, de kraampjes,\nde brommertjes en van de weg door het verder ongerepte oerwoud.\nHet hotel Deli River was een pied a terre om rustig te verblijven en naar terug te keren.\nMet zijn prachtige tuinen, vijver, het gegak van ganzen en de waterlelies, palmen en alle prachtig verzorgde tropische planten en vruchten. De tijd ging ondanks de rust van dit paradijs veel te snel, na 2 weken moesten we het weer verlaten.",

Onze fantastische chauffeur Erwin vergezelde ons de gehele reis.\nDe kamers zijn ruim en sfeervol ingericht. Ieder dag stond er in de kamer en badkamer een vers geplukt boeketje bloemen uit eigen tuin.\nHet eten is prima. Vooral het ontbijt is genieten, met iedere dag vers fruit en niet te vergeten heerlijke koffie.\nOok alle lof voor het uiterst vriendelijke en behulpzame personeel. Zij deden hun werk met veel plezier. Kortom: In het Deli River is het goed toeven.\nEen plek om naar terug te verlangen.",

Samen met enkele familieleden toch nog \u00e9\u00e9n keer teruggegaan: geen moment spijt gekregen! Mede dankzij de grote gastvrijheid van het personeel, het eigenaars-echtpaar (Dirk Buiskool en Diana Pardamean) inbegrepen.\nOp het eten - of het nu om ontbijt, lunch of avondeten ging - valt weinig aan te merken: de menukaart bood voldoende variatie. Tip: vraag vooraf of de gerechten goed warm geserveerd worden.\nDe kamers: ruim, sfeervol ingericht en schoon. Bed zorgde voor prima nachtrust. Mooi uitzicht over de goed onderhouden parkachtige tuin. Veel bloeiende heesters, bomen, vlinders...\nZwembad: achteraf besefte ik dat ik er te weinig van genoten heb! \nIn vergelijking met de 3 andere hotels,waar ik tijdens deze reis verbleef, verdient \"Deli River\" het predikaat \"uitstekend\" zonder meer.\nHans, Zutphen.",

Het personeel was wel erg vriendelijk om ons te helpen met het tonen van andere kamers. Het lijkt alsof op de site alle voordelen van alle kamers is bij mekaar gebracht. Het was dus een beetje kiezen wat voor ons het belangrijkste was. Wel erg vriendelijk personeel dat altijd klaar staat om te helpen. Ook organiseren ze erg fijne rondreizen door Sumatra die volledig aangepast kunnen worden aan eigen voorkeuren. Al bij al een erg fijn hotel met erg behulpzaam personeel en eigenaars.",

De baas van het hotel was op vakantie dus de staf stond er alleen voor; ze hebben het geweldig gedaan. Ze dachten mee over tripjes, vervoer, en het ontbijt wat ze serveerden was elke dag anders en super! Onze kamer was onze veilige plek, waar we zelfs de moskee tijdens de ramadan niet zo hard hoorden als in de rest van de omgeving. Een extra opvallend fijn punt voor ons was de beveiliging; we waren op de laatste dag richting het hotel in een illegale taxi gestapt. De chauffeur weigerde toe te geven dat hij niet wist waar het was en vroeg om extra geld terwijl we al anderhalf uur reden in the middle of nowhere. De beveiliging van Deli River heeft hem toegesproken en hem om half 1 's nachts naar het hotel geleid. Ze stonden met seinlichten op de weg. We zijn nog nooit zo blij geweest om bij een hotel aan te komen! Complimenten dus voor de hele staff! Enige minpunt zijn de vele muggen, aanrader is een anti muggen stekker mee te nemen.",

Super vriendelijke mensen, warm welkom en heel behulpzaam! Heerlijk zwembad, met rechtstreekse telefoon naar de keuken. Tip: locale vlees gerechten van de kaart!!! ",

Als begin- of als eindpunt  van een reis over Sumatra is dit kleine hotel, met veertien kamers, is dit hotel aan te bevelen. De kamers in aparte huisjes zijn ruim en goed ingericht, voorzien van alle gemakken die je tegenwoordig van een goed hotel verwacht. \nHet personeel is vriendelijk, spreekt Engels en begrijpt Nederlands, zij vinden op iedere vraag een passend antwoord; zij zijn behulpzaam om de gast op zijn/haar gemak te stellen.\nOmdat het reisbureau Trijaya is ook op dit terrein is gevestigd, kunnen de laatste voorbereidingen van de reis met de staf besproken worden. \nHoewel het hotel niet dicht bij het centrum van Medan ligt kan met een taxi een rondrit door de stad geregeld worden, waarbij de historische plaatsen en gebouwen door de chauffeur worden aangewezen.\nSinds 2001 heb ik mijn reizen in Indonesi\u00eb door Trijaya laten verzorgen, en iedere keer heb ik in het hotel tot mijn genoegen overnacht.",

Na een uurtje rijden vanaf het vliegveld brengt het \u2018eigen\u2019 taxibusje je in de rustige sfeervolle omgeving vlakbij de oever van de Deli River. En dan is het lawaai, de chaos en het gehobbel over de slecht onderhouden wegen van Medan al heel snel vergeten.\nOnder de palmen bij de vijver scharrelen ganzen huiselijk op zoek naar alles wat van hun gading is. In het open restaurant en ontvangstgebouw staan een hartelijk onthaal en een koel drankje gereed. De gastenverblijven liggen kleurig en fleurig en koel langs kronkelende paadjes met kleurige bougainville. Niets herinnert aan de hectiek en de drukte van het verkeer buiten de hekken.\nIn zo\u2019n omgeving slaap je de laatste restjes van de jet lag al heel snel bij.\nWie in Hotel Deli River logeert, maakt natuurlijk tochtjes naar en door Medan. Gastheer Dirk Buiskool heeft voor zijn gasten interessante routebeschrijvingen gemaakt die vooral langs koloniale gebouwen voeren en die de moeite van het bekijken meer dan waard zijn. Voor mij als Nederlandse bijzonder leerzaam en leuk.\n\u2018Thuis\u2019gekomen wacht er dan het heerlijke zwembad tussen de bloesembomen en de overdadig groeiende ananassen, kruidnagelstruiken en nootmuskaatbomen. Waar mogelijk worden die natuurlijk in de keuken verwerkt en \u2019s avonds eenvoudig maar lekker geserveerd.\nIn Hotel Deli River waande ik me even in het paradijs.\nTineke",

Zimmer sind mit Aircon, Terrasse und Blick auf den G\u00e4nseteich geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Ruhige Lage. Essen war super.

Die mit Elementen traditioneller Batak-Architektur und der Kolonialzeit sehr geschmackvoll gestaltete Unterkunft ist eine gr\u00fcne Oase f\u00fcr Erholungsuchende im gesch\u00e4ftigen und lauten Medan - und  nur rund 30 min vom Zentrum entfernt. Die Zimmer sind ausgesprochen sauber, der Service ist exzellent und vom Swimmingpool aus hatten wir einen tollen Blick auf den Deli River Fluss und den Regenwald. Wir hatten ein sch\u00f6nes Deluxe Zimmer mit AC, TV, sehr gutem Wifi und einem gro\u00dfen Balkon mit Blick auf den gepflegten Garten mit einem kleinem Teich. Das dem Hotel angeschlossene Restaurant bietet eine ausgezeichnete K\u00fcche. Alles ist famili\u00e4r und professionell gef\u00fchrt von den niederl\u00e4ndisch-indonesischen Besitzern Diana & Dirk. Absolut empfehlenswert! Wir kommen auf jeden Fall wieder!",

              "text": "De orang utans in de vrije natuur bekijken was al jaren een grote wens. Daarom besloten wij een week op Sumatra door te brengen en een kleine rondreis vanuit Medan te maken.  Wij zochten een rustig starthotel in het drukke Medan en dan kom je al vlug bij Hotel Deli River terecht. Op de site ontdekten we dat zij tevens touroperator zijn onder de naam \" Tri Jaya Tours and Travels\", wat is dan gemakkelijker dan de reis door hen te laten samenstellen voor een (in onze ogen) heel schappelijk bedrag? De correspondentie verliep heel vlot en bij de keuze van de overige hotels werd met onze wensen rekening gehouden. \nBij aankomst in hotel Deli River waren we heel aangenaam verrast: door de toegangspoort kom je vanuit het drukke Medan in een oase van rust terecht. Iedereen was even vriendelijk en spontaan, de kamer perfect, het eten en het zwembad heerlijk. De rondreis werd besproken, op een persoonlijke wens voor een bezichtiging werd meteen gereageerd en het nodige speurwerk verricht. De volgende dag begonnen we aan onze rondreis, aan het verkeer en de toestand van de wegen moet je even wennen, maar bij onze aardige chauffeur voelden we ons op ons gemak. Hij leerde ons onderweg het nodige over de natuur en de bevolking en ging op al onze verzoeken in. Ook over de hotels onderweg onderweg waren we meer dan tevreden.We hebben de koloniale gebouwen in Medan bezocht, het uitzicht op de vulkanen in Brastagi is fantastisch, het  Tobameer met zijn prachtige natuur en batakhuizen, en voor ons het hoogtepunt: de orang utans: we hebben er maar liefst zeven gezien! Na de rondreis brachten we nogmaals een dag in hotel Deli River door en de volgende dag vertrokken we al heel vroeg met een geweldige ontbijtbox naar het vliegveld.",

Ontbijt erg goed met een super service van het personeel. Iedereen doet super haar best het naar je zin te maken. De chauffeur Rudy is echt een topper. Samen met hem een aantal dagen op pad geweest. Spreekt redelijk Engels en weet erg veel over omgeving en natuur.",

Het hotel bestaat uit kleine huisjes met smaakvol ingerichte kamers, airconditioning is standaard, allen met een knusse veranda uitkijkend over de schitterende tuin. Echt een paradijs. Het personeel is zeer hulpvaardig en probeert het je echt naar de zin te maken. Het eten is voortreffelijk en het hotel is zeer schoon.

Je kunt ook 's nachts de ramen open zetten, omdat deze zijn voorzien van muskietengaas. Het hier 's avonds een must om je met muggenwerendmiddel in te smeren. In het restaurant wordt je dit direct aangeboden en geadviseerd je direct in te smeren. Zij hebben overigens een heerlijk ruikend antimuggenmiddel!! In overleg kun je ook buiten de kaart om eten. Excursies zijn hier te boeken en je chauffeur is erg bekwaam in het rijden hier en zeer vriendelijk en bescheiden",

Die Anlage liegt am Rand des quirligen Medans in einer wundersch\u00f6nen Gartenanlage. Die Zimmer sind sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet. \nBesonders hervorzuheben ist die Freundlichkeit und Hilfsbereitschaft des Personals, welche wir erfahren konnten. Denn leider wurde mein Mann am letzten Tag unseres Dschungelaufenthalts krank. Da es ihm am Abend im Deli River schlechter ging, fragte ich an der Rezeption nach einem Arzt. Ein Mitarbeiter des Hotels bot sogleich seine Hilfe an, telefonierte mit einem Arzt, welcher noch 22 Uhr vorbeikam. Zum Gl\u00fcck ging es meinem Mann am n\u00e4chsten Tag schon besser, so dass wir unseren Weiterflug antreten konnten. Hiermit m\u00f6chten wir uns nochmal f\u00fcr die unkomplizierte Hilfe bedanken!",

Kan mij voorstellen dat dit alleen mogelijk is wanneer het niet super druk is. \nWij hebben vanuit Deli Rivir een jungle trekking geboekt in Bukit Lawang. Onze chauffeur Ruudie die ons ook op heeft gehaald van het vliegtuig, ging ook mee naar Bukit Lawang. Ik was bij vertrek ziek en hij deed er alles aan om ervoor te zorgen dat ik mij goed voelde.

Unser Zimmer war geschmackvoll eingerichtet und einwandfrei sauber, von der Terrasse aus hatten wir einen herrlichen Blick ins Gr\u00fcne. Restaurant und Garten lie\u00dfen erkennen, dass das ganze Resort mit Liebe und architektonischem Geschmack gestaltet wurde. Das Essen hat uns gut geschmeckt, besonders sch\u00f6n empfanden wir das reichhaltige Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck mit frischen Fr\u00fcchten auf der Restaurantterrasse. Das Personal war sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit, unser Wunsch nach flacheren Kopfkissen wurde sofort erf\u00fcllt. Die Chefin, Diana, beriet uns so gut, dass wir bei ihr gleich eine 2 w\u00f6chige, preiswerte und einwandfrei organisierte Rundreise mit dem zuverl\u00e4ssigen Fahrer Daddy buchten.",

De service is uitstekend, de mensen zijn behulpzaam en vriendelijk en de organisatie lijkt geschoeid op een min of meer Europese leest.

Hotel Deli River ligt aan de rand van de megastad Medan maar dat zou je niet zeggen. Zodra je op het terrein van het hotel bent, word je omgeven door het groen en een oase van rust. Het hotel bestaat uit cottages en een zeer goed restaurant, Omlandia. De sfeer is een blend van traditioneel Indonesisch architectuur en decoraties en een Nederlandse finishing touch van luxe. Alleen al het ontbijt is fantastisch: je krijgt allerlei heerlijke, homemade en verse producten opgediend terwijl je uitkijkt over de prachtige tuin van het hotel. Het personeel is bijzonder gast-en service gericht en wil alles voor je doen om het verblijf aangenaam te  maken. De eigenaar Is Nederlander en heeft veel kennis in huis over de geschiedenis van Medan en Sumatra in het algemeen. Als ik weer naar Medan moet, weet ik wel waar ik ga logeren!!",

Das Hotel liegt direkt bei Medan, allerdings etwas abseits der viel befahrenen Stra\u00dfe. Man hat absolut seine Ruhe, um sich von Jet Lag oder den Strapazen der langen Reise zu erholen. Die Zimmer sind sauber und mit Air Condition, eigener Dusche und gro\u00dfem Bett ausgestattet. Der Service ist super. Es gibt W-Lan im Restaurant, einen sauberen Pool und gutes Essen. Wir w\u00fcrden dort wieder einkehren.",

El hotel es realmente bonito, los jardines son encantadores (contiene varias especies de \u00e1rboles y plantas tropicales que rodean un estanque con patos), las habitaciones son preciosas, c\u00f3modas y est\u00e1n muy bien equipadas (nosotros pod\u00edamos ver el precioso jard\u00edn desde la terraza de nuestro bungalow), el personal es muy atento y amable, la piscina infinita es incre\u00edble, el desayuno con vistas al jard\u00edn es maravilloso y la comida del restaurante Omlandia es buen\u00edsima. Si volvi\u00e9ramos a Medan, sin duda nos volver\u00edamos a alojar en el mismo hotel, un para\u00edso en medio de la ciudad de Medan.\n\nNosotros pasamos 2 noches en el hotel Deli River, la noche antes y despu\u00e9s de nuestro tour de 4 d\u00edas (3noches) por la isla de Sumatra contratado con la agencia de viajes del mismo hotel, Try Jaya Tour & Travel. Diana, propietaria del hotel, nos organiz\u00f3 un viaje a medida por la isla de Sumatra que en tan s\u00f3lo cuatro d\u00edas nos permitir\u00eda visitar lugares tan alucinantes como el lago Toba, la isla de Samosir, Berastagi y Bukit Lawang. El tour fue realmente maravilloso. Todo los lugares que visitamos nos gustaron much\u00edsimo, los hoteles eran encantadores (fue realmente emocionado pasar la noche en una casa batak en el lago Toba), el conductor Yuel era muy prudente y se adapt\u00f3 perfectamente a nuestro ritmo. Sin duda, recomendar\u00eda Try Jaya Tour & Travel por su profesionalidad y experiencia en la organizaci\u00f3n de excursiones por la isla de Sumatra. \n\nGracias a Diana y al equipo del Hotel Deli River y de Try Jaya Tour & Travel por este fabuloso viaje que nunca olvidaremos!!",

Een ideale plek om te acclimatiseren, rustig, prachtige plek, lekker eten en uiterst vriendelijk personeel. Tot zover de opmerkingen die ook door anderen al zijn gemaakt.\nWe leerden het hotel echter nog beter kennen toen we na een aantal dagen na een onfortuinlijke val in de jungle bij Bukit Lawang onze reis al weer moesten afbreken. We  besloten opnieuw naar Hotel Deli River te gaan en werden uiterst gastvrij ontvangen. Alles werd gedaan om het ons zo prettig mogelijk te maken: ontbijt en diner op de kamer, hulp bij het regelen van formaliteiten bij de ANWB-alarmcentrale, als troost een mandje met fruit en lekkers, etc.  We hadden het in deze voor ons vervelende situatie niet beter kunnen treffen! Ook hier nog eens dank daarvoor!",

              "text": "Dit prachtige, goed onderhouden hotel is Sumatra op zijn best. Mooie Indonesische architectuur, een stukje paradijs in de Tropen. Karakter zonder concessies te doen aan luxe. Eigendom van een Nederlands-Indonesisch echtpaar. Communicatie in het Nederlands is dus mogelijk met de eigenaren, maar het vriendelijke personeel spreekt goed Engels. Dit was veruit het beste hotel waar we tijdens onze rondreis door Sumatra hebben gelogeerd. We hebben goede herinneringen aan het zwembad met na afloop heerlijke drankjes en hapjes. Voor de Nederlandse gasten staan zelfgemaakt bitterballen, kroketten en poffertjes op de menukaart. Het restaurant is uitstekend. De kamers gezellig, smaakvol en exotisch ingericht. Handig dat de airconditioning niet rechtstreeks op het bed is gericht. We hebben een door het hotel georganiseerde stadsrondrit door Medan gedaan waar we veel hebben geleerd over het Nederlandse koloniale verleden in Medan.",

De kamers zijn bijzonder smaakvol ingericht en comfortabel. In tegenstelling tot de andere hotels waar wij op Sumatra verbleven, beschikken de kamers over een warme douche en goede bedden. Daarnaast was er een heerlijk zwembad om te relaxen. Het eten was van uitstekende kwaliteit en het personeel erg vriendelijk en servicegericht. \nIk zou dit hotel zeker aanbevelen en kom hier graag nog eens terug!",

Klein zwembad met beperkt aantal zitplaatsen. Verder alles goed, we moesten vroeg weg maar ontbijtbox werd voorzien... Kortom, Mooie kamer voor doorrit naar luchthaven Medan, niet supergeslapen door de vroege moskee gezangen",

Mijn grootouders van beide ouders hebben in voormalig Nederlands-Indie lang gewoond en gewerkt. Mijn vader was luitenant tijdens de politionele acties in het bataljon van 4 2 RI (1947-1949). Mede door de  kennis van heer Buiskool (historicus) en de fantastische hulp van zijn vrouw ( voormalig reisleidster) heb ik vrijwel alle plekken kunnen vinden, waar ik als kind veel over gehoord had. Hotel Deli River is een rustige plek met een fantastische tuin, net buiten het drukke Medan, maar met een taxi gemakkelijk bereikbaar. Hotel Deli River is een aanrader, een goede uitvalsbasis voor mensen, die nog naar hun roots op zoek willen gaan.",

              "text": "Lage au\u00dferhalb von Medan, ca. 1 Std. zum Flughafen. Sch\u00f6n und ruhig gelegen in einer tropischen Gartenoase.\nAnfangs hatten wir ein Standardzimmer, das uns allerdings nicht so gefallen hat, da es schon sehr alt und abgenutzt war. Die Sauberkeit des Schrankes lie\u00df sehr zu w\u00fcnschen \u00fcbrig (Schmutz und tote Spinnen) Beim 2. Aufenthalt hatten wir ein Honeymoon-Zimmer, das etwas sch\u00f6ner und moderner eingerichtet ist, vor allem das Bad. Das Himmelbett ist allerdings gew\u00f6hnungsbed\u00fcrftig, da es sehr hoch ist und man einen Hocker braucht um ins Bett zu gelangen.\nFr\u00fchst\u00fcck mit Blick auf den sch\u00f6nen Gartenbereich. Es gibt frischen Kaffee, t\u00e4gl. wechselnder frischer Obstsaft, Toast, Butter, Marmeladen, Honig, frisches Obst, Scheiblettenk\u00e4se (naja), t\u00e4gl. wechselnde S\u00fc\u00dfspeisen z.B. Bananenkuchen, Muffins usw. Ein hartgekochtes Ei (sehr hart gekocht!!! dieses hatten wir 3x, immer bl\u00e4uliches Eigelb). Au\u00dferdem gibt es immer eine t\u00e4gl. wechselnde  indonesische Fr\u00fchst\u00fcckskomponente z.B. Reis Porridge, Fr\u00fchlingsrolle, Kokosreis in Bananenblatt...\nDas Essen im Restaurant fanden wir mittelm\u00e4\u00dfig. \nDas Hotel selber, der Rezeptionsbereich und Speisesaal ist schon etwas veraltet und nicht sehr ansprechend eingerichtet. Dadurch dass die R\u00e4ume sehr gro\u00df sind, fehlt es etwas an Gem\u00fctlichkeit.\nDer Pool ist sch\u00f6n angelegt und hat einen traumhaften Ausblick.\n\nS\u00e4mtliche Transfers k\u00f6nnen vom Hotelpersonal bestellt werden. Maya hat sich hierbei als sehr zuverl\u00e4ssig erwiesen. Eine andere weibliche Angestellte hat uns immer das \u00fcberteuerte Taxi bestellt, trotz mehrmaligen Nachfragens nach einem Bluebird-oder Expresstaxis.\nBsp.: Hotelfahrer zum Flughafen 200.000 IDR\n          Festpreistaxi der Angestellten zum Flughafen 150.000 IDR\n          Expresstaxi zum Flughafen: 130.000 IDR\n          Bluebird vom Sun Plaza zum Hotel: 50.000 IDR (ca. 45 Min.)\n(wie oben erw\u00e4hnt dauert es zum Flughafen ca. 1 Std.)\nDie bereits erw\u00e4hnte Angestellte hat uns 1x ein Festpreistaxi zum Localbus bestellt f\u00fcr 100.000 IDR f\u00fcr eine Fahrtdauer von 15 Minuten.\nProvision???\nNat\u00fcrlich sind das jetzt keine gro\u00dfartigen Summen f\u00fcr uns Urlauber, aber da geht es ums Prinzip. Wir geben gerne gro\u00dfz\u00fcgig Trinkgeld bei entsprechender Leistung her. \n\nFazit: man k\u00f6nnte mehr aus diesem Hotel machen.",

Als wir zu der Zeit dort waren war sonst weit und breit keiner zu sehen. Wir mussten erst jemanden suchen. Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck wurde dann deutlich zu sp\u00e4t serviert. schlecht, wenn man Anschlussverbindungen hat. Die Rechnung musste bei Anreise bezahlt werden.

The next morning the staff arrived at 8 to prepare breakfast and clean the restaurant. As the dining room is an open restaurant in the middle of a tropical garden and nearby jungle with many trees, at night there are bats who spoil food at the floor which makes it dirty. Every morning this natural waste is cleaned. When our staff arrived at 8, guests were already waiting, although breakfast was ordered at 9. Guests said to our staff  that they had ordered at 8.30, so there had been miscommunication. Still guests could have breakfast at 8.30  in the yellow dining room where there was no food waste from the bats. We do not understand why guests complain as they had their breakfast at 8.30 although it was ordered at 9. Concerning the complain about the rooms, they are spacious with comfortable beds and private bathroom, there is coffee- and tea and water heater, air conditioned  in the room and the private balcony looks out over a tropical garden native fruit trees and fishpond.

Vor allem die Sauberkeit der Zimmer, die Freundlichkeit der Angestellten und die Anlage waren kaum zu \u00fcbertreffen. Wir konnten uns hier zwei Tage lang richtig entspannen. Wer nach Medan kommt um sich die Stadt anzusehen, sollte wegen der Lage ein zentraleres Hotel bevorzugen. Die Verbindung zum Flughafen ist gut - Eigener und zuverl\u00e4ssiger Shuttle. Wir ben\u00f6tigte ca. 1 Stunde dorthin. Essenstechnisch k\u00f6nnen wir nicht alles empfehlen. Das Nasi Goreng Spezial war allerdings wirklich super. Ebenso waren wir vom Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck begeistert. Sollten wir wieder in Medan sein, werden wir wiederkommen.",

Ons verblijf nu in Sumatra verliep in meerdere delen: drie nachten Deli River, twee nachten Danau Toba Int., uit nostalgie, dan een rondreis van 14 dagen en nog zes nachten Deli River achteraf. We kunnen nu duidelijk het verschil maken tussen de hotels.\nDeli River staat voor persoonlijk onthaal, gastvrij, kleinschalig, uitstekende accommodatie en kamers, schitterend ontbijt op maat, lekker eten en drinken, warm en proper zwembad... met dank ook aan het vriendelijk en tof personeel, dat ook Engels verstaat en praat. Dat is in andere hotels, zelfs de hele grote, dikwijls een probleem. Gastheer en gastvrouw Dirk en Diana staan u desgewenst ook in het Nederlands te woord.\nEn niet te vergeten: Deli River heeft een probleemloze internetconnectie, handig bij contacten met de thuisbasis.\nHet eigen reisbureau Tri Jaya had voor ons een 14-daagse reis uitgestippeld in Noord- en West-Sumatra. De dagen zijn voorbijgevlogen, de chauffeur bleek op ons lijf geschreven, we hebben veel meegemaakt. We kunnen er een boek over schrijven.\nKortom, we zouden zo terug willen maar dat is helaas voorlopig niet mogelijk.",

Unser Zimmer, das in einem Nebengeb\u00e4ude lag war sehr geschmackvoll und wertig eingerichtet. Richtig verw\u00f6hnt wurden wir zum Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck. Auf der Veranda mit Blick zum tropischen, sehr gepflegten Garten und Seerosenteich war f\u00fcr uns ein Tisch mit Bl\u00fcmchenschmuck gedeckt und dann wurde nach und nach ein \u00fcppiges feines Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck aufgetragen.Von warmen Ananasmuffins bis Fr\u00fchlingsrollen, frisches Obst, Saft, Eier... Wir konnten gar nicht alles probieren.\nAm Tag unserer Abreise w\u00e4hlten wir statt fr\u00fchem Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck das angebotene Paket zum mitnehmen. Auch dieses war sehr fein und \u00fcppig. Aber der Clou war der \u00fcbers Hotel bestellte Fahrer. - Er wartete zu unsere Abreisezeit bereits mit dem Wagen vor unserem Zimmer, mit  dem Fr\u00fchst\u00fcckspaket bereits im Auto. Einem ebenfalls anwesenden Hotelangestellten konnten wir den Zimmerschl\u00fcssel \u00fcbergeben und so war unser Check out in Sekunden erledigt. Ein toller Service, wie wir ihn noch nirgends genossen haben.\nIm Restaurant der Anlage haben wir ein feines Abendessen genossen. Es war lecker und h\u00fcbsch angerichtet. Die Atmosph\u00e4re in diesem Lokal ist sehr angenehm.\nWir w\u00fcrden das \" Deli River \" jederzeit wieder w\u00e4hlen und k\u00f6nnen es nur empfehlen !",

Alles is goed verzorgd, een fijne sfeer en het is gelukkig niet massaal. Vooral de kleinschaligheid gecombineerd met kwaliteit beviel ons goed. Ook erg prettig dat de eigenaren iedere dag persoonlijk aanspreekbaar zijn en zeer vriendelijke en hulvaardig. Heel handig dat zij ook een reisbureau hebben waar je voor heel Indonesi\u00eb kunt boeken.\nWij komen zeker terug!",

Na een heerlijk tropisch welkomsdrankje worden we weer naar 1 van de prachtig gelegen kamer gebracht. Wat een genot om na een verre vermoeiende reis in een kamer te komen die schoon, gezellig en goed ingericht is. Een ware mix van Holland en Indonesie. Ook het restaurant is zeer de moeite waard. Niet alleen wat inrichting betreft maar zeker ook de zeer gevarieerde menue kaart. Het aanwezige personeel is altijd vriendelijk en zeer behulpzaam. Wil je nog even zwemmen?? Neem dan een verkoelende duik in het prachtige zwembad achter het restaurant met uitzicht op de Deli River. Kortom een echte aanrader; neem dat maar van ons aan!!",

Zeker nu de vliegveld buiten de stad gesitueerd is. In het hotel aangekomen is het een verademing. Mooi uitzicht, rustig,  diervriendelijk en een groene omgeving. Wij waren daar met volwassen kinderen. Ze hebben ook leuke tijd daar.",

La chambre et la salle de bain sont tr\u00e8s propres avec tout le confort n\u00e9cessaire, eau chaude, climatisation, moustiquaire, lit confortable et suffisamment de rangement. Le personnel est extr\u00eamement serviable et aimable, le restaurant sert des plats indon\u00e9siens traditionnels et un peu de cuisine occidentale \u00e9galement. \nLa piscine est tr\u00e8s belle et tr\u00e8s propre, avec des chaises longues et des parasols tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9ables. \nSeul petit b\u00e9mol, nous \u00e9tions log\u00e9s au troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tage, ce sont les meilleures chambres mais mon p\u00e8re se d\u00e9pl\u00e7ant avec beaucoup de difficult\u00e9 et \u00e0 l'aide d'une canne, tous ces escaliers en bois \u00e0 grimper sous une pluie battante (donc \u00e7a glisse !) n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 une sin\u00e9cure pour lui.",

              "text": "Das Hotel Deli River liegt etwas ausserhalb von Medan,  aber sp\u00e4testens wenn man die Abgase und die Hektik des Zentrums erlebt hat, bereut man den etwas l\u00e4ngeren Anfahrtsweg in diese Oase  nicht. Die Anlage ist sehr gepflegt und um einen sch\u00f6nen Seerosenteich gruppiert. Die H\u00e4user sind zwar neu, weisen aber trotzdem einen kolonialen Charme auf. Der Swimmingpool ist sauber und man hat vom Becken aus eine sch\u00f6ne Aussicht auf die Gegend. Das Essen im Restaurant ist ausgezeichnet und das Personal sehr dienstfertig. Wir haben in keinem anderen Hotel auf unserer Reise ein so  reichhaltiges Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck bekommen.Es hat M\u00fccken (wie so oft in Indonesien...) aber das Personal ist sehr bem\u00fcht die Viecher im Zimmer zu eliminieren, falls sie es trotz der Fenstergitter reingeschafft haben. Die Zimmer sind gut ausgestattet und bieten einiges an Ablagefl\u00e4che. Zimmer mit Verbindungst\u00fcre sind allerdings ringh\u00f6rig. Was uns auch gefallen hat, sind nachts die Jungelartigen Ger\u00e4usche, denn ringsum ist viel gr\u00fcne Wildnis und der Fluss ist nicht weit.\nDer Laundryservice ist zu empfehlen da schnell und effizient.\nWir haben durch das Hotel eine mehrt\u00e4gige Reise zu Plantagen aus der Kolonialzeit gebucht, auf denen damals unsere Verwandten lebten. Unser Chauffuer Yoel konnte zwar kaum Englisch, hat aber die Plantagen auf Anhieb gefunden und war nicht nur ein angnehmer Mensch, sondern auch ein sehr vorsichtiger Fahrer. Die Nostalgie -Stadtrundfahrt in Medan mit ihm hat leider wenig gebracht, da er wohl all die Geb\u00e4ude kannte, jedoch keine Erkl\u00e4rungen abgeben konnte. Hilfreich war dagegen das vom holl\u00e4ndischen Hotelbesitzer verfasste und abgegebene B\u00fcchlein mit Erkl\u00e4rungen und Fotos der Kolonialarchitektur in Medan. Er hat Geschichte studiert,  ist spezialisiert auf dieses Gebiet und somit ein interessanter Gespr\u00e4chspartner, wenn diesbez\u00fcglich Fragen auftauchen.",

Wij zaten er in de periode van de ramadan en dan heb je wel veel last van de moskee\u00ebn. Veel mensen die we tegenkwamen verklaarden ons voor gek dat we 5 dagen in Medan bleven maar bij dit hotel heb je niet het idee dat je in de stad zit! Aanrader dus!",

Il faut preciser qu en Indo, la plupart des hotels ne feront pas de difficult\u00e9s pour accueillir 3 enfants dans 1 meme chambre, surtout s ils sont en bas age, comme les notres (9, 8 &5), du moment qu on se contente d un grand lit ou 2 lits jumeaux, on ne paye pas de supplement. \nDe tous les hotels ou nous avons dormi, celui disposait d un standard Europ\u00e9en appreciable, mais comme ils sont r\u00e9solument tourn\u00e9s vers une client\u00e8le Hollandaise, les go\u00fbts culinaires sont diff\u00e9rents et peuvent surprendre un palet francais (pas de lait frais pasteuris\u00e9, mais du lait en poudre, aussi bien pour le petit-d\u00e9jeuner que pour la pur\u00e9e !) alors forc\u00e9ment, \u00e7a peut surprendre et d\u00e9plaire. Et puis, si vous voyagez avec des Indon\u00e9siens, il manquera assur\u00e9ment la version locale pour le petit-d\u00e9jeuner (les mie goreng ou nasi goreng ne sont pas disponibles ici, juste des toasts, avec beurre et confiture ou paillettes au chocolat Hollandais, voire des c\u00e9r\u00e9ales pour les enfants).\nAutres points que les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents commentaires n'ont pas mentionn\u00e9, l'hotel se trouve en fait tr\u00e8s excentr\u00e9 de la ville et avec la circulation de plus en plus charg\u00e9e que connait Medan, il faut compter environ 1h de trajet jusqu'au centre ville. Pour ce qui est de l'a\u00e9roport, celui-ci ayant d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 le 25 juillet 2013, c'est a dire quelques jours apr\u00e8s notre d\u00e9part, je ne peux dire combien de temps il faudra pr\u00e9voir pour se rendre jusqu'au nouvel a\u00e9roport, mais d\u00e9finitivement, ce sera beaucoup plus qu'avant... se renseigner aupr\u00e8s de l'h\u00f4tel si besoin. \nDans les petits plus de cet h\u00f4tel, le jardin dispose d'une mini tyrolienne tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e des enfants et si vous faites un peu attention aux diff\u00e9rents arbres, vous trouverez, entre autre, un goyavier pr\u00e8s de l'\u00e9tang et un durian juste derri\u00e8re le mur de palissade, pr\u00e8s du restaurant. Ils mettent aussi \u00e0 disposition,  des jeux pour jeunes enfants tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ci\u00e9s de nos loulous, pendant l'attente des plats. \n Donc, dans l'ensemble, un bon h\u00f4tel, un peu ch\u00e8r malgr\u00e9 tout pour le standard qu'il propose, mais il vous permettra d'\u00e9couter sans frais le chant pour l'appel \u00e0 la pri\u00e8re. Et pendant la p\u00e9riode du ramadan, les mosqu\u00e9es se feraient presque conccurence...\nAlors, oui, tous les autres commentaires sont presque justes, mais il y a des ommissions que j'avais envie d'exprimer.",

Aan de andere kant van de vijver ligt het hoofdgebouw met het restaurant. Daarachter ligt een prachtig zwembad, heerlijk om na een lange vliegreis even af te koelen. De kamers waren netjes verzorgd, prima werkende airco die goed was geplaatst (dus niet op het bed blaast), complete maar iets gedateerde badkamer. We zaten in het eerste deel van acht kamers. Er zijn nog acht kamers bijgebouwd, die ongetwijfeld iets mooier sanitair zullen hebben. Het ontbijt is ruim en lekker.Goed hotel om even te wennen aan de hitte van Azie.\nVoor kleine kinderen zijn er op het terrein ook nog wat leuke speeltoestellen.\nEnige minpunt: het personeel spreekt niet allemaal goed Engels, maar met handen en voeten kom je een heel eind.",

De buurtbewoners zijn ontzettend vriendelijk en waarderen het dat je wilt kennismaken met hun woonbuurt.\nDe kamers zijn prima., het eten goed.

Een prachtige tuin, super comfortabele kamers, waar het je aan niets ontbreekt. Een prima restaurant, mooi groot zwembad, enzovoort. Enorm behulpzaam- en  buitengewoon correct personeel. Kortom: een erg goede keuze om daar een nacht door te brengen aan het einde of begin van de vakantie. Enige minpuntjes die we zouden kunnen aangeven: het restaurant, dat om onduidelijke redenen is vernoemd naar een Groningse studentenvereniging,  is heus goed, maar de prijs-kwaliteit verhouding vinden we niet in balans. Verder ligt het hotel 6 km van het vliegveld en daardoor komen er wel erg veel vliegtuigen langs. Wij waren er op een zondag en de hele ochtend hebben we naast de vliegtuigherrie ook geluisterd naar onuitputtelijk gezang uit de naastgelegen kerk. Dit, gecombineerd met de eigenaresse die hardnekkig toonladders zat te oefenen op haar piano, die in het open restaurant staat, gaf een aardige kakofonie van geluiden in de vredig ogende tuin. Het ontbijt moet je een half uur van tevoren aankondigen, zodat ze het kunnen voorbereiden. Dat is dan ook uiterst compleet. Wat ons betreft: schitterend, maar 1 nacht was genoeg.",

Vanaf het vliegveld een klein uurtje rijden door Medan heen en je komt in deze rustige omgeving terecht, heel bijzonder. Het personeel is aardig, aankomst is gastvrij. Diner is prima, wel sluit het restaurant al om 21.00 uur. Met de gastvrouw afgesproken dat we de volgende ochtend op tijd wilden ontbijten vanwege geplande trips. Er waren nog 4 of 5 andere koppeltjes die al aan het ontbijten waren, dit bleek wat teveel voor het personeel. We moesten een half uur wachten tot we het ontbijtje kregen. Ontbijt is ook prima, alleen niet heel veel. Het vult net.\n\nDe kamer is erg leuk, ziet er netjes verzorgd uit, romantisch hemelbed. Badkamer is wat achterstallig, maar goed te doen.",

We sliepen in luxe en zeer prettige appartementen, tegenover het in typisch Aziatische stijl opgetrokken restaurantgebouw midden in een schitterende tropische tuin, met alle kleuren, geuren en geluiden van dien. Het personeel is buitengewoon behulpzaam en vriendelijk, het eten heerlijk. Bij aankomst en verder bij elk ontbijt werden we vergast op het heerlijkste vruchtensap en vers fruit. Aan het hotel is een reisbureau verbonden dat voor ons een perfect programma organiseerde om Sumatra te leren kennen. Acht dagen in een airconditioned busje met gids/chauffeur langs de fraaiste plekken van Noord-Sumatra, heel prettige hotels, het was geweldig. Na die acht dagen voelde de terugkeer naar Deli River, voordat we weer zouden doorvliegen naar Bandung, Java, als een soort thuiskomen. Een must! \nRobin Gerrits en Laura Daeter en kinderen, Hilversum",

Prima hotel om na de overzeese vlucht een aantal dagen te verblijven om te acclimatiseren. Vergis je niet, het duurt ongeveer 3 dagen voordat je je aan de hitte hebt aangepast. We hadden een trip geboekt via Trijaya tour & travel de reisorganisatie van dezelfde eigenaren als van het hotel en niet te vergeten het restaurant Omlandia. De aangeboden trips worden vaak gestart met 1 overnachting in Deli river. Het is zeker aan te raden 1 of 2 nachten extra te boeken. Je kunt Medan bekijken, er is veel moois te zien. Daarna kun je uitgerust beginnen aan de trip die je begoekt hebt. Wij zijn via Pamatang Siantar naar Samosir gegaan. Heeeel mooi. Vriendelijke chauffeur, hai Zul! Everything okay? Volgende keer een andere trip, er is zoveel te zien. Fam. Buiskool, bedankt! Ellen en Tineke",
