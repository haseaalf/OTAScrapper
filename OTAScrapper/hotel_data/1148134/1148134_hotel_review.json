              "text": "Saya menginap di 1 Bedroom Villa selama 4 malam beberapa hari yang lalu. Jalan masuk memang cukup sempit hanya muat 1 mobil saja, tapi security sangat sigap membantu dari luar gang sampai parkiran.\n\nProses check in sangatlah cepat, karena villa sudah dipersiapkan sebelum kedatangan. Untuk villanya sendiri sangatlah lengkap, dari peralatan makan, gelas, rice cooker, kulkas 2 pintu, microwave, setrikaan, bahkan floatiespun bisa request.\n\nSalah satu yang paling membekas buat saya adalah keramahtamahan dari staff hotel yang ada, yang saya ingat pak Adhi & pak Nanang banyak membantu saya selama menginap. Selain itu, Recognition Elite Status juga cukup baik, setiap benefit yang ada diperhatikan dan dipenuhi.\n\nSaya tidak ragu jika ada kesempatan kembali menginap disini. Recommended!",

Dari front desk sampai room service, semuanya top. \n\nDari sisi propoerty, walaupun kami tidak ada keluhan yang berarti, semoga club anantara dapat mempertimbangkan untuk menambah propoerty baru di Bali yang memang menggambarkan kelasnya karena menurut kami villa yang di seminyak ini yang paling sederhana dibandingkan dengan propoerty2 lain dimanapun juga. Sangat disayangkan dengan kelas Anantara diwakilkan dengan kelas villa yang seperti ini. Could have been much better karena kita kenal Anantara. Kelas service yang diberikan kurang sepadan dengan propoerty yang ada..... \n\nSebagai anggota AVC kami merasa sangat diservice dan dimanja di villa ini. TOP!! hanya sedikit disayangkan dengan approach leader sales yang memberikan update kepada kami agak sedikit kurang mengena dihati (dengan pemilihan kata2, terkesan sombong) dibandingkan dengan sales (Ms. Shelly) yang menghandle kami yang sangat sopan dan memberikan informasi yang sangat baik kepada kami. \n\noverall, we love anantara's group of propoerty.",

Our flight back home was delayed twice and the staff allowed us to leave our luggage at the resort and provided us with a room to shower and relax in before our flight. We stayed in the villa with a private pool which was close to the dining area, public pool and lobby. Facilities were clean and the bathroom in the villa was amazing. In terms of location, it is about a 20 minute walk or a 5-10 minute drive away from the main Seminyak area. However this wasn't an issue as the staff called us a Bluebird Group taxi when requested. Would highly recommend Avani, purely for the service from the staff. ",

Stayed in new wing so was pretty clean but a fair way to walk to the reception/restaurant/swimming pool (unless you book a villa with pool).  Great for honeymooners, newly married and tourists who just want peace and quiet.  Not ideal for children because there is nothing much for kids. Fair way to walk to the village (1.5 km) and beach is not within walking distance but they have free shuttle on scheduled time or request. ",

The visit to the hotel was amazing, After a day of hustle and bustle this hotel offers a peaceful retreat. The privacy is perfect and the staff is 1st rate for customer service. Krisna and her team at guest services pay attention to every detail and make you feel appreciated. The Serai restaurant was great for breakfast and dinner with folks like Ben and Ayu treating us like family. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Bali. Make sure to get a Balinese massage. That will take you to the next level of relaxation :0)",

Overall a great place for a quiet break.  Great place for couples.",

We have traveled all over the world and Anantara Bali has to be the overall top resort and staff team I have ever seen and experienced.   If you are going to Bali as a couple as we did, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this resort.  Not on the beach which was fine with us. The local restaurants, small markets, and massage/spa's were very close and affordable. no car needed for us but the resort has scooters yo can rent if needed.  We went to relax and we did x10. We did not want to  leave.  There are two Anantara Resorts in Bali very close to each other;  1 bigger one on the beach and this one which is about a mile away inland, smaller and have villas with your own small pool - very private and quite - LOVED IT ALL.

The staff and was always courteous, friendly, and professional. They were always smiling and greeted us whenever we passed by. Even the cook staff would remind us to take an umbrella before we headed out on the days it may have rain. The grounds are beautiful and meticulously kept. The villa we stayed in had a kitchenette and wonderful pool to swim in. The layout of the room and bathroom felt very secluded and secure. We felt very safe and private during our stay. The whole property is very picturesque. The wifi was always strong and constant, and it was very convenient having a laundry room and exercise room we could access for free. \n\nWe paid for the shuttle from the airport and all the drivers we rode with were really nice. There's also a different shuttle that runs to the Vacation Club's sister hotel on the beach. We had access to their pool and facilities, their beachfront, and of course we ate at their restaurant too. It was like staying at 2 hotels for the price of 1! The front desk always kept our interests in mind when helping us choose excursions during our stay. We ended up doing the Uluwatu package and it was incredible. \n\nBut my wife and I both agree that our favorite activity was the cooking class! Their chef taught us how to cook a traditional Balinese dinner and showed us the ingredients used. I even picked up some techniques to use back at home. It was a fun and rewarding experience well worth the price. They even gave us certificates, aprons, and a cutting board to take home with us. \n\nOverall, everything we experienced was perfect. We ordered room service multiple times and we satisfied every time. We loved our stay here, and will most definitely be coming back and recommending the Vacation Club to friends and family. Well done.",

The accommodations were wonderful, the bed was comfy, the outdoor shower divine, and the private pool offered even more luxury. They have a restaurant on site if you want to eat in or you can order to your room. The staff was so friendly however that we preferred to enjoy our meals/snacks at the dining area. While the location of this accommodation isn\u2019t on the beach they offer convenient transfers to their sister property which is beach front. You can also use the facilities at the other property if you want to say, have lunch by the infinity pool before walking along the beach. AVC however is in a good location, walking distance to plenty of shops and restaurants. \n\nAlso can I just say it again...the staff was fabulous and made us feel right at home and welcomed. Thank you for a wonderful stay! ",

We stayed in the 1 Bedroom Villa and while we were out for the day, the Villa was neatly made up again; A/C blowing and lights were switched on for us in the evening when we returned. When using the Main Pool, the towels were neatly put out and included Sun Screen. Our 2 year old had fun with the inflatables provided by the resort. Overall a GREAT Experience and we will definitely be back again!!",

Turned off the main street to a long drive leading to a quiet and serene environment. The staff was friendly and welcoming. The 1 bedroom villa at Anantara was perfect for our group. 1 separate large room with very comfy king bed and huge bathroom with both indoor and outdoor shower. Then a separate small building with a kitchen and a convertible couch bed that was reported to be amazing. Had it's own small full bathroom. Pillows and linens were way better than expected. Kitchen was well appointed. AC worked very well in each room. Our villa had it's own private pool. What an extravagance! Also a nice main pool with cabanas. \nWalking distance to shopping, food and the beach. (20 minutes) \nRoom service was pretty good but eggs were lukewarm by arrival. Staff attended to our needs. All together a wonderful relaxing week. ",

My friend joined me a few days later.  I had set-up an airport transport for her with the front desk the day before.  The next day, a different person commented that I must be excited that Ms. Kristin was joining me today.  \n\nI was a high maintenance guest.  I asked them a ton of questions about the area, getting around, etc.  They were always willing to help.\n\nI loved having a private pool!  With the heavy heat and humidity, I found myself constantly going into the pool to cool off.\n\nThey offered a shuttle to the Anantara Beach Resort.  I'm so glad we did that. Their pool was magnificent and it was right on the water.  They had security that stopped people from coming up and bothering us.  At night, they had S.O.S.:  Sunset on Seminyak where they had happy hour type deals for food and drink and bean bag chairs facing the sunset.\n\nExcellent experience!",

We had a 1 bedroom villa for my family. Ours was 2 separate buildings with a private pool in the courtyard. One is a bedroom with attached bathroom, tub and shower and the other is living room/kitchen which has a sofa bed for my son. the second 3/4 bath is all by itself accessed from a door in the courtyard. We loved it. EVERY single employee we came across in our stay was helpful and nice... and with so few villas they all knew us by name from the first day. Can't wait to go back.",

The villa was very well appointed with a really comfortable bed, spacious bathroom (with a good shower and a large tub), a private garden with pool and a living area with a small kitchen.  For privacy the villa was amazing and the design meant that there were cool shady areas during the heat of the day.  The living area and bedroom were at either end of the garden (in the Balinese style). The pool was deep enough to swim easily, or to stand shoulder deep in cool waters. The villa was quiet and relaxing, although the bustling heart of Seminyak was less than 10 minutes walk away.\n\nThe staff at the resort were incredibly helpful and friendly, everyone said hello and asked how we were, many would stop for a chat to ask more about our stay in Bali and to ensure we were enjoying ourselves.  Two of the organised activities which we would strongly recommend are the temple visit and the cooking course.  These provide an amazing insight into Balinese culture and help to really appreciate the island. \n",

The area in which the hotel is located is great, only a few minutes walk to lots of shops, restaurants and bars. \nThe hotel was private and felt worlds away from the crazy outside world. \nThe rooms were wonderful, they were spacious, clean and had everything could have needed. The pool and outdoor sitting area was also great for a lazy day in the sun. The rooms were quiet and as soon as you walk through the villa door you feel relaxed. \nWe only ate breakfast within the hotel but could not fault it, was delicious. \nReally happy with our stay and would come back, great value for money.

Amenities and towels were lovely. I would give this place a 5, except that some of the aspects were so very tired. I like to use my kitchen, but this one was so very old and tired. On the plus side, there is an espresso maker in the kitchen!\nI came here as part of my Hilton Grand Vacations plan, so wasn't completely a member. (so no breakfast for me.) But the dining room looked fantastic. \nYou can see that there is a lotto pride in keeping this property up to great standards.",

The front staff and the support staff are very good and passionate, The rooms were clean and tidy, The layout of the 1,2 and 3 room resorts very good, we stayed on all the 3 villa's during our 6 nights stay. \nAs the part of the stay, we had to attend a preview for the becoming members, They were not at all professional and very aggressive (rude) in their tactics for selling the product . the resort in puket and at bali are totally different class, Puket was very upscale and at bali was not up to that mark. Will recommend to use the facilities in Puket and not at bali (not worth the money )\n\nCheers\nRajesg",

I love the privacy of having your own pool and the enclosed area.\n\nWe were greeted by Santi on arrival and she was so professional and very helpful.  I wish everyone was like her.  Unfortunately not everyone is like her and other staff should learn from her.  We have different experience from different staff.  Others would greet you when you get back to the villa whilst others ignores you.  There was another guy in reception who was nice and offered to call our driver as we were waiting at 0130 hrs in the morning for a sunrise trek... he was very helpful but unfortunately I didn't manage to get his name. \n\nOn our last night We requested for a late check out for the next day as our flight was at 1840hrs but they could not accommodate us as we were told they are fully booked.\n\nWe ordered cocktails on our last night and we waited almost half an hour for it to be delivered in our villa.  They were not that great either. I had better cocktails outside the hotel.\n\nIn summary, I still like the place but they could have at least taken that extra mile to accommodate some of the needs of the guest... after all, what's another extra hour to compromise for a late check out... it does dampen the good experience you had and felt like since it is your last day, they can't be bothered to accommodate a small request.",

There are basic cooking facilities and access to a shared laundry. Staff were so kind and friendly, nothing was too much trouble for them to help with.  I highly recommend this for families as it is hot in Bali, all the kids wanted to do was swim all day, and we could do this in the comfort of our own complex complete with it's own large gardens.  Management pre-empted our stay and some very thoughtful gestures to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable.  The street is quiet but is a short easy walk to the coffee shop and the main streets without being noisy.",

This is the first time we visit Bali and this club is located along a small alley which is hard to notice especially we arrived very late at night.   I have booked a one bedroom villa and I have no complain about the room itself.  There is a courtyard between the bedroom and living room where the tiny swimming pool is located.  There is also a tree planted at the lawn which is exactly what you can see from their website.  this place itself is so peaceful and if you are looking for activities, they are just few steps away from the club.  Staff are very friendly and helpful.  Club provides free bicycles, nice touch.",

If you are looking for beach and lots of activities in the middle of hustle and bustle, this is not it.  This is great for quiet relaxation, hanging out in your villa, walking to dining and shopping (staff is great at directions).  Both are within a leisurely 10-15 minute walk.  Lots of massage places for foot or body massages nearby for inexpensive \"on the cheap\" massage or use the villa spa for luxury service.  Will definitely go again for a relaxing time and a base to explore other parts of Bali.",

The staff is friendly and helpful, as it is a standard for all Anantara properties I've stayed in. The villas are spacious and comfortable. The food is OK. But despite being in a good place for you to explore Seminyak, the location is disappointing, If you like to walk around, there is construction works all over the sidewalks, which makes walking a bit painful and dangerous. To go to the beach the hotel offer a shuttle only 3 times a day. So, if the reason for your vacatin is to enjoy the sun and the beach, you be better off at the Anantara Resort.",

We enjoyed taking the shuttle to their hotel on Seminyak beach multiple days and were equally impressed with the pool and amenities at that location- we also had a couple's massage at their spa which I would highly recommend. For those looking to be a bit more active, it is within walking distance of a long, busy stretch of road filled with beautiful shops and boutiques and an array of incredible and trendy restaurants. The best thing about Anantara was the extreme friendliness and willingness to help of their staff. They all knew our names and were ready to serve if we needed anything- including spending much time calling the airport to find our lost piece of luggage for us!",

There is a swimming pool in each villa. \n\nAmeneties are complete - just call them if some toiletry items are not in your room; the kitchen is also stocked with commonly used appliances, cooking tools, plates, and cutleries. The internet is also fast, compared to Indonesian standard. \n\nOver-all, it was a cozy and charming place to stay at while in Bali.",

Not only that, but it the most wonderful room we stayed in during our trip with a gorgeous private pool.  Awesome!  It had a fabulous bathroom with 2nd outdoor shower, and even a third shower in the pool bath.  The separate living room featured a full kitchen, which we used to warm up our left overs from our fabulous cooking class.  We were able to wash our clothes in the washer and dryer provided, which was very convenient for our long trip.  Overall, this was resort the best!",

              "text": "I only managed to stay and book a 2 bedroom pool villa and 1 bedroom pool villa for 2 nights. Wanted to book the 3 bedroom pool villa for 3 nights but it was fully booked and it was like 3 months in advance. \nAnywaes we made do with our 2 nights booking.\n\nLocation:\nThe name Anantara itself, people knew it to be a big and luxurious hotel chain but for this property, it doesn\u2019t really show. To get to the place, we had to go through a narrow 2 way road and we had to really open our eyes to see the small sign board directing the place. When we spotted the sign, we had to turn and go through another narrow road that will eventually leads to wat looked like a dead end. Anantara staff will be there directing the small amount of parking lots. There are no those usual big Anantara brand signage on the wall of the entrance. U really need to have a vehicle to travel around here as to get to the main road, u will at least need to walk more than 15mins. This is really shocking that before entering the property, u dun have that wow feeling. Even those guest that ive brought along dun have the impressed feeling. They thought I had booked some budget villa.\n\nProperty outlook:\nThere is only one small entrance door which u dun really expect that form and well known brand. When we step in, the first thing we saw was the small check in lobby. It still dun have the impressed feeling. Just less than 10 steps from the door is the lobby. I looked around and just another few steps is the public swimming pool. It looks quite small and it doesn\u2019t justify itself from the photos in the website. Just beside the swimming pool is the restaurant. There is only 1 restaurant in this property and it looked really small and empty. \nThe property also looked really empty as for the 3 days ive stayed, I can count the no. of people with my 2 hands. Wonder why or how the 3 bedroom and 2 bedroom villa is not available.\n\nVilla outlook:\nIll talk about the 1 bedroom villa first. Ive requested that ill be having 4 guest in the 1 bedroom villa so they took the initiative to provide a double bed instead of the sofa at the so called living room. The living room look like a normal room with the wall replaced with floor to ceiling glass panel and of coz they have blinds to bring down for privacy. Well from the feedback I got, at night, they will be some insects entering that room maybe because of the small gap below the door. Anywaes, the living room is equipped with television and air condition.\nBeside the living room, there is a small toilet combined together with the shower area. It didn\u2019t looked like a bathroom as there are no sign on the door. We thought it was a service duct for the main switch board. We only discovered that it was a bathroom on the 2nd day. \nIn the so called middle of the villa is the private swimming pool. U have to call the front desk to open the circulation and so called Jacuzzi function of the swimming pool after 4. Well the swimming pool can get quite dirty with leaves and flowers and branch tweaks falling from the plantation and tree surrounding it. So before every swim, we have to literally clean up the swimming pool.\nThen at the other end of the villa is the master bedroom. They have all the standard items like tv air con safe box etc..in the room. Bed is king size and it\u2019s a little hard with very soft pillows not that to most of our likings. The bed is surrounded by mosquito netting which when not in use, it could be places at each corner of the bed which of coz needs the string to tie it nicely to one corner or else it would just come back to the center. This is good to prevent mosquito but the bad thing about this is that only one person could watch the tv when lying down. The tv is place at one corner where if someone lie down on one side of the bed, he wont get to see the tv screen as one side of the mosquito netting is obstructing the view.\nAnywaes in the cupboard, they even provide a shopping basket for us to use.\n\nBathroom:\nThe bath room is huge. They have 4 sections to the bathroom. One for the bathtub cum basin area, one for the toilet (doing business) area, one for the showering area and one for the god knows wat area is that.\nThe bathtub is huge and there is a glass window where the swimming pool view could be seen when ure in the bathtub and of coz theres blinds for privacy. Their toiletries as those normal basic ones with the additional of the sea salt bath for soaking in the bath tub. There is a looked like wooden ladder which they say is to hang the towels. Well it looks stylish and something new but I dun think hanging more than 1 towel is effective to let it dry as the steps are near to one another so the top towel will be coving most of the bottom towel. \nNext is the shower area. I seriously dun like Anantara shampoo as it\u2019s the jasmine smell as to me it personally will make me headache as the smell Is too strong. They should have a system where u could choose the shampoo before checking in.\nThey have the rainbath which nowadays most hotels would provide it. Behind the shower area is a door leading to the god knows what room is that area which I will touch on it later.\n\nFor the toilet area, it just a small room for u to do the business with frosted door for privacy but with one floor to ceiling glass wall which I really dun understand the whole concept as u can literally see the god knows what area and form the back door of the showering area, u could literally walk to the god know what area and to the glass panel of the toilet and see thru it. There is seriously no privacy.\n\nOkie now for the god knows wat area is that. It occupies the back of the toilet and shower room. The floor is slippery and there is this like bamboo pipe above for showering. From my first view, it looked like the shower area before entering the swimming pool. But there is no access to the swimming pool at all. I seriously dunno what concept are they trying to create. Doing business in the toilet at night could also be creepy as u can look thru the glass wall to that area which is opened to the sky.\n\nAnywaes, for the two bedroom villa, its practically the same, only with two bedrooms with the same things and the living room in the middle. To go to one room to the other is so troublesome. U need to wear the slippers, open the sliding door to enter the living room then open another sliding door to exit the living room.\nThe private swimming pool is bigger maybe 1 \u00bd times the size of the 1 bedroom villa.\n\nAnywaes, we were so lucky to get the villa near the lobby area as when we tried to explore the place, we had to walk so far to reach the end and even when we reach the end we cant see the 3 bedroom villa. Maybe theres a secret door. It would be really scary to walk at night to the furtherst end if ure unlucky enough to book it as its like walking through a jungle.\n\nFacilities:\nThere is a gym and washing machine area. I tried to enter the gym but as I enter, it was so hot. Maybe need to switch on the air con myself.\nFor the washing machine area, I think it\u2019s a really bad idea as everyone is able to use it. I would prefer individual villa having their own washing machine area. I did use the washing machine and it was at night. As there are only 2 small washing machines and 2 dryer, With a lot of clothes, I had to use 2 washing machine. Then have to go back to my villa which is quite far, wait for an hour or so , go back to the washing machine to transfer to the dryer, go back to the villa to wait for around 2 hours for the clothes to dry at the dryer. And all these process took me till 2am. Even that the clothes did not dry so I tot tmr morning I would put in the dryer again. So the next morning I did as I wanted to but after 2 hours, all my clothes are chucked to one side in the basket still wet and other guest clothes are now in the dryer. I guess my clothes are in there less than 10 minutes for other guest to take it out for their own use. Very evil guest. So that is why I suggest that each villa should have their own washing machine and dryer.\n\nService:\nService is practically excellent as per usual of Anantara standard. From checking in to our stay and checking out, the service of the front desk to the staffs are excellent. This is the only reason where the star rating brings up the property.\n\nConclusion: \nAs ive mention, only the service and the size of the villa are worth mentioning or rating. The rest are really a big disappointment from and Anantara brand. As first impression is always important and the luxurious image is important, there should really be a big change for them to create awareness to other people.\nEven though the service is excellent and up to standard of 5 or even 6 star property, but there are too many things on this property that made me really  torn whether to return to this villa the next time I come to Bali.",

              "text": "it is a late review for my stay in this hotel in Jan 2015.  While the villa and facilities are relatively small compared to other anantara properties in Thailand, but it is relaxing. I am not bothered much by mosquitos  And clients can use the larger pool and beach in nearby Anantara seminyak hotel, there are free shuttle bus between the 2 hotels 3 times a day I think.\n\nThen, this is what happened to me in my third day in Bali.\n\nMy wife and I went to nearby Anantara Seminyak Hotel to enjoy our afternoon. Early that morning, we saw some kids surfing in the beach. It seemed to be fun. The water is shallow, despite the windy weather and a bit of waves. \n\nEven though, we have never done surfing before, and we only know frog swimming, we rented two surfing board and went in.  Initially, the water is only on our knee, we tried a few time, but could not ride the wave, and after a few failure, we find the wave have actually pull us further into the water. Water was near our chest.  We tried to swim out with the surfing board, but every time, the wave pull us further into the ocean.  The surfing board become a big drag, and frog swimming is also not powerful enough for us to swim out of wave. We don't know free style, which may be more useful. \n\nWe began to wave our hands and yell for help, even though there aren't many people there. I began to think my life may end there, as the wave become bigger and bigger as we were dragged further into the ocean. \n\nThen, after a couple of more minutes, we saw the life guard from Anantara come to us with a larger surf board. We threw our small surfing boards, which was a major drag, and tried to climbed to theirs, but we have almost exhausted, and the wave has make it even harder.  I asked the life guard to save my wife first and wait for the second one to save me.  However, my wife can not climb to the rescuer's board, she just grabbed it, and that rescuer has also become exhausted himself because of this, and have to leave my wife, about tens of yards away from shore.  Quite a few hotel guests, jumped into the water, particularly Ben from Australia. They pulled my wife out of water and saved her life. \n\nSo special thanks to Ben, though I only know he is Australian and came to Bali for vacation with her girlfriend. He has helped to calm down my wife, and ask her to throw up the sea water.  I was aslo rescured shortly after. \n\nHotel manager of Anantara Seminyak Hotel, I recalled his name is Hilton, but not so sure, was immediately come and arranged Anantara car to bring us to an international hospital, to have thorough check.  The drivers have waited there for 30min to 1hr, until we checked in to the hospital, and was taken care of. \n\nMy wife was hospitalized for 1 day, and when I go back to our hotel Anantara Vacation Club to pick up some of her cloth, all the staff have already know the accident and sent their best regards. The hotel manager, a handsome young man, also come to ask if there is any thing they need, and whether I need a car.  Don't exactly recall if I used one of their car, but it was very helpful and comforting. Eventually, we spend last day in the hotel, resting before leaving. It was an quite experience, and Anantara, both the villa, and hotel, have gave us very good impression. \n\nSo very good hotel. You can depend on them.\n\nSorry for my English, not a native speaker. \n\nBen, if you see this, want to think you again for saving my wife's life.",

It is within walking distant to shopping streets and close to some nice restaurants in Seminyak area too.\n\nFront Office Staff: Staff is friendly and ensure that we feel at home. Not our first time there and thus, we are familiar with the property. Staff was able to identify we were returned guests and thus, a warm welcome.\n\n2 bedroom pool villa: 6 of us stayed in a 2-bedroom pool villa. Cozy enough for the 6 of us. Staff set up a sleeping bed in the living area for 2 pax and helped to replace one king size bed for 2 single beds in one of the rooms. Would love to stay in the 3-bedroom villa but unfortunately, it was unavailable during my period of stay there.\n\nBreakfast: Can only order one portion of food. Any extra orders will be chargeable. Selection of breakfast is very limited.\n\nRestaurant: Only one small dining area. Does not bother us since we will be out most of the time.\n\nMembership: We are platinum member and thus, services rendered were excellent and fantastic.\n\nOverall: Will definitely stay here again. Hope that breakfast selections would be more and also, we could order extra portions.",

I had planned for diving trip before with a dive center (ASDB dive center). However due to communication failure, there was no pickup at all. While not denying my part n responsibilities in the communication failure, I could not go for my dive trip and in addition the dive center decided to push all the failure to me and treated my case as a \"no show\" and hence I had to forfeit my payment (full payment for a parties of 3 divers). In additional of claiming that there booking is full and could not offer me another date for diving.\n\nHowever, the resort staff ( Miss Santi and Sri) was at hand to help me find another dive center n made another booking for diving the next day. As such I was able to fulfill my main objective for this Bali trip.\n\nThe resort staffs also are very helping and friendly in answering my questions and attending to our needs.",

To start, the resort features 20 individual villas only, which makes it very exclusive. We were lucky enough to be able to stay in the only 3-bedroom villa, which features 3 individual building (one with the living quarters on two floors), one with a living room and one with a kitchen and dining room) with a decent size open swimming pool in the middle. Very welcoming and attentive service from the front office and F&B staff in the resort. Housekeeping was doing a great job too. Really enjoyed that family vacation, and although the property in located in the middle of busy Seminiak, we really enjoyed a very quiet stay.",

The tub was just huge and amazing. We had a small dinner where the Chef did a private cookout. It was awesome. Location wise also good, near restos and coffee shops and nightlife. The only downside i think is the driveway which was kinda small, but i guess typical of other resorts as well. I will recommend to friends to stay here.",

After the long travel,we were warmly welcomed by Sri and company and she showed us around - the reception area, the pool, the facilities and finally to our room located at the near end of the property. We occupied a one-bedroom villa and arrangement for a 3-person accommodation was in place.Upon entrance, we appreciated the soothing,relaxing Balinese ambiance around us.The dim-lit bedroom and well-lighted bathroom were spacious and clean. Anti-mosquito measures were provided for. All three of us agreed that  we had  blissful sleep and rest during our entire stay. The kitchen area though was small and there was no space to assemble the dripping rack.The coffee maker was not initially working and had to be replaced. Spoons were missing.No kitchen cloth/wipes or  floor rags around. As our schedule was tight, we had no opportunity to dine there. The Wi-Fi connection was spotty and not constant.The staff in the reception area was really helpful and accommodating.The location of the AVC is strategic and accessible  by foot to shops, restos- to savor a variety of gastronomic surprises,the beach and a supermarket, especially when one has to contend with the traffic. Overall,  we liked and enjoyed Anantara  Vacation Club- Seminyak, the hospitality was 2-thumbs up but it could do better with improvement and upgrading its facilities and amenities to match their other world-class resort clubs.",

              "text": "We arrived earlier than the check-in time but luckily we were given room 114. The staff were friendly and the bellboy showed us around our villa. The villa pool size was bigger than imagined, with a bathtub that overseeing the pool outside. The bedroom size was okay to accommodate the 3 of us (we were travelling with our toddler) and the bathroom was quite huge. \n\nThe bed was soft and comfy, and so was our toddler cot. We were happy that the baby cot was already setup upon our arrival. The Management could have also invested in mosquitoes net for baby cot as well since the mosquitoes rate was very alarming. And also suggesting to have bed decor, at least on the day of arrival. The curtains and mosquitoes net was dusty and did not appeared to look clean. The bedroom parquet flooring was squeaking. And on one of the nights (we stayed for a week), I think I heard rats running on the rooftop!\n\nWe also noticed that our villa was missing the umbrella and the straw bag. And the hair dryer was not working. For the missing umbrella and exchange of hair dryer, we have to request twice. No doubt the staff apologized but we are certain that a 5 star resort can do better. \n\nWe were disappointed that our toddler was not given a towel, and were replenished 2 instead of 3 on our daily room make up. We did not like the quality and smell of the shampoo, body shower and lotion. Luckily we managed to get something we like at the nearby supermarket. \n\nThe separate living room or kitchen was not convenient to us. Not to mentioned that there were lack of many items, i.e. kitchen cloth. The basin tap was tilted to the left, the water kettle did not look inviting and we dare not even touch the rusty coffee machine! The equipment and cabinets looked old. Anantara should consider to revamp the whole place when bought over from the previous owner. \n\nHowever we were grateful with the helpful staffs who prepared us with mosquitoes lamp as our little toddler was badly bitten by mosquitoes and gave us suggestions. Despite all the preventive measures (mosquitoes patch, repellent, oil, coil and lastly lamp), she got a total of 31 bites on her face and fingers (average of 5-6 bites every nights). And thanks to the GM, Jonathan, who visited us and provide explanations. \n\nWe were quite upset with the daily set breakfast, which only consist of juice, yogurt, a choice of cereal or bread and coffee/tea. Would have been better if they come with a hot dish. The pizza also need improvement on taste and please take note if you order the seafood pizza. There was a fish bone in it and we were lucky that we were the one encountering it instead of our toddler!\n\nThe location of the club was good as only about 5-10 mins walk to the main busy street, with lots of caf\u00e9 and convenient stores. One can easily hail a taxi but take note to insist on running a meter or a flat price.  Overall, it was different experience from Anantara Phuket Mai Khao. Hopefully our next Anantara trip would be better. \n\nWe did had a great holiday despite the little inconveniences. And special thanks to the caring staffs from the reception and also the caf\u00e9. Tiffany and the rest, you did a great job!",

The driver was great and we used him again twice to take us on tours around Bali and we would have brought him home with us if we could have he was so fantastic. \nWe were welcomed warmly to our villa and booked in very efficiently. \nWe got to bed around 0430 and slept in the next morning. \nWe went to lunch and this began the love affair with the food in Bali. \nWe swam in the hotel pool after lunch and then went back to our villa and had another swim as each villa has their own pool. \nWe went to dinner and had some beautiful food in our hotel dining room and  loved it. The service for the 15 days we were their was exemplary and the staff so friendly. \nCould not fault any person at the villas from the Gardner to the General Manager they were the most friendly people we have ever met anywhere in the world. \nThe people of Bali were beautiful and so friendly we loved every minute of our holiday. I say to anyone who has reservations about going to Bali don't it is a wonderful beautiful country and the people are amazing. Best holiday ever. ",

              "text": "I came here recently on a family trip as part of my introductory Anantara Vacation Club membership package. The service has been great, but I do not think I would come back nor extend my introductory package. \n\nThe vacation club is tucked away in one of those alleyways not too far away from the main street, Seminyak St./Rd., which is about 15-20 minutes away on foot. However, that also means this property has no beach access, and really is not in the center of actions. They do run shuttle service to their beach front hotel every two hours or so.\n\nThen there is the villa: my biggest problem was that the rooms were quite dated and not well maintained. They were spacious, yes, but definitely not new. Shower room door had faded paints, and there were other spots and signs of wear. It felt quite like a property from the 90s. \n\nThe staff were very positive and polite and always smiling. They were by and large much more helpful than the Anantara Hotel staff I encountered (I stayed at the beach front hotel for the second leg of our stay). \n\nThe default breakfast choice was pretty much nothing, maybe that's because few came for breakfast because of the fully equipped kitchen. All in all, it was continental break in its barest form (think continental breakfast on your university-organized trips), and I was dismayed.\n\nOverall I just don't think it was good value, but I can see how it would work for people come with their families. This would not be my top pick, and is definitely enough to put me off from upgrading to a full membership.",

              "text": "We stayed here because my sister in law is a member of Anantara and she gifted a private villa to us for a few days.  long story short, it was a solid 3.5 star experience.  here are some tips to maximise your stay (in my humble opinion).\n\narrival:  don't get the Anantara taxi service.  it costs $30 USD (+21% tax), and most taxis will agree to around $12 (no tax), or 150,000 IDR.  we set one up prior to coming, but be committed to haggling at the exit.\n\nservice:  the service is here top notch. i contacted the GM via his responses to the reviews here on trip advisor and i mentioned to him that it was our 10 year anniversary.  he promptly replied and provided some amazing touches to the room that made me incredibly happy.  The GM, Jonathan, came through in big way.   the concierge also helped me a number of times, booking restaurants, recommending shopping places, giving us directions and so on.  \n\nI must also say that the bell boy (or staffer) called Nangnang (sp?) gave us the best introduction and explanation to a suite i've ever experienced.  he showed everything and how it all worked.  he was really great.  so again, the service is 5 star here.\n\nfacilities:  so here's the thing, the Anantara villas is not a beach front property, that's Anantara Resort and Spa.  that property is very different, more on this later.  The vacation club villas provide you with your own private pool.  to be honest, we left our kids at home so we actually didn't use the pool.  we sunbathed and relaxed by our private pool one morning, but we wanted a beach and big pool experience, so we took the free shuttle to the Anantara Resort and Spa.\n\n3 times a day, there's a free shuttle to the beachfront property.  you can take the free shuttle and then stay on their pool area, as long as you spend $25 per person on F&B.  we enjoyed a whole day there, suntanning, having poolside drinks and snacks, dipping into the pool, and taking full advantage of their free wifi.  i strongly advise taking a day to do that, as the infinity pool overlooking the beach is wonderful.  $25 isn't that bad, because it's $10 to rent any deck chair along the public beach.  but at Anantara you get wifi, sunscreen, towels, their nice bathroom, and their infinity pool.  \n\nfood:  since our stay did not include food we sadly did not eat there at all.  There are some great places to eat if you walk to the main strip on seminyak road (ask the concierge for the shortcut and a map) for breakfast.  for lunch and dinner, walk out to the main roads and you'll have great options for both local and international fare.  \n\nobviously use trip advisor to find the spots you want, but don't be afraid to randomly try some places.  we took a chance on the #100 ranked restaurant in seminyak and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  adventure and have fun.\n\nso, in summary, it's 5 star service, but with only 3 star facilities in my opinion.  it just wasn't as stunning as some other places, even when compared to their beach front property.  the things that dropped this rating to 3.5 stars for me was that the coffee machine in our villa was dirty and probably has never been cleaned properly.\n\ni will say that many people complained about the mosquitos, but we did not have a problem.  they provide many ways to deal with them and i only got bit a few times during our 4 day trip, but it was not at the property.  so just use the sprays provided and be mindful of closing doors.\n\nbottom line, i enjoyed our stay at the Anantara vacation club Bali, especially enjoying their service, but i left thinking that I would like to stay at the Anantara resort and spa.  Also, if choosing between this property and the Phuket one, I would suggest the Phuket one based on facilities and access to the turtle village.\n\nhope this helps!",

              "text": "Stayed 2 nights in one-bedroom private pool villa, room no. 114 as a promotion offer by credit card. Before we came here, we were a bit thrilled by the negative reviews on Tripadvisor saying the room is old and kinda dirty, as well as the problem with mosquito. But after our stay here, I would definitely want to write a review to share our own amazing experience in here!\n\nThe entire villa is with high privacy. Inside the villa it's big enough (About 100 sq.m), with living room that equipped with cooking facilities, utensils and television, pool (but quite small in size), bedroom and bathroom. The decoration of the bedroom looks retro yet romantic with the wooden floor and furniture. Bathroom was bright and clean, and the bathtub is really big. They also have a bit outdoor area outside where you can hang and dry your clothes after washing. \n\nLet's talk about the mosquito problem people are worrying about - they provided spray and lotion to avoid getting bites. We everytime after shutting the door of the bedroom, we will apply spray and lotion on our skin. Inside the room there was also electric mosquito repellent to help. To be frank under the cool air temperature with air con, mosquito would not be very active, and not to mention after all these prevention, we did not get bites inside the room. But if you are talking about at outdoor area inside the villa, personally think it's inevitable given that you are visiting Bali, a tropical area. Yet, we did not really see mosquito or other insects inside the villa and the resort, I thought I saw the staff doing pest control everyday.\n\nWe spent most of our time chilling inside the villa, except going out for dinner. There's a supermarket around (COCO SUPERMARKET) at about 10-min walk. We bought some fresh food and cooked our own lunch in the living room. I love to cook a lot and was surprised for all the utensils and appliances they provided - like rice cooker, toast machine etc. You could clean all utensils with detergent and new cleaning scrub pad. All appliance functioned well and utensils were quite new (despite some dishes get marks).\n\nFor dining experience, we only had breakfast at the cafe. The breakfast composited of a fruit juice, beverage (coffee or tea), yoghurt, main (Rice/Noodles/Pastry or Egg dish) and some muesli/fruit aside. The food were well prepared and were full. Will be great if the menu can be in more variation.\n\nFor facilities, they have a bigger swimming pool outside and fitness centre. We did not went to the pool, and for fitness centre it is equipped with basic equipment like fit ball, yoga mats, dumbbell, 1 treadmill, 1 elliptical and 1 cycling machine. Given the capacity of the villa itself think the numbering and variety of the facilities can be improved.\n\nLet's talk about the Staff - Tifani, the staff at help desk was cheerful and efficient when check-in. She then lead us to the room and introduced well, with a little bit humour. She also helped us check-out and called for a taxi when we were leaving to Ubud. Manager was very sincere and greeted us when we left the resort.\n\nStaff in cafe area were polite and responsive, despite I spot that when it was at peak hour, there were only 2 staff at the cafe doing all serving tasks. Some mainland china travellers were  not patient for not being served and ordered their breakfast right after they were seated. May need to arrange 1 more staff when cafe is at peak. Overall staff were friendly who always greet you when seeing you inside the resort. \n\nVisitor could enjoy the beach and pool facility at Anantara Resort & Spa Seminyak, they provided some shuttle service but you need to spend USD$25/ head for dining at there. The amount is acceptable and could be considered if you are looking for sunshine and beach. But we did not go for it since we already had enough during our stay in Nusa Dua prior to visiting Seminyak.\n\nIt was truly a great, relaxing and soothing experience for our stay, and we will consider Anantara chain for our upcoming trips in other places!",

I was also happy to learn that you enjoyed the breakfast and food in the restaurant. \r\n\r\nI will be looking in to the issues you raised regarding the air con and cleanliness as a matter of urgency. This is generally not the case. \r\n\r\nRegarding your comment re the rats, we have never seen rats at the resorts. Some guests have reported that after leaving their living room doors open, cats have come in and eaten any food that they have left out. Perhaps this was what happened in your villa also?\r\n\r\nWe would love to have you come and stay with us again. Please feel free to contact me directly at jsweeneylowe@anantaraclub.com should I be able to assist you in any way in the future.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nJonathan",

They got us a driver for 3 days so we got to see a lot of the island. Semanyak is a great location, some good restaurants and bars. Definitely a place to check out. Hope to go back again in the near future.",

We have gone with a more boutique style that offers a very high level of personalised service, which I believe you did enjoy. It is true that some owners prefer the bigger style hotels of Phuket & Samui. However, there are equally as many who enjoy the Bali offering in AVC's attempt to offer our owners variety in their vacation choices. \r\n\r\nWe would love to have you come and stay with us again.

My husband does magic and illusion the staff all wanted to learn and participate.\nWe all had a great stay, have given our feedback on some upgrades that the villas need to Jonathon. Re the steps or lack off out the villa swimming pools, as it is very difficult for anyone that is not agile. The location is ideal if you like quiet, lots of restaurants near by. The villas are spacious, lack a few things on the cooking utensils but I am sure they would give you these if you asked. My Husband liked the Villas, peaceful. We will be returning.",

The villas were spacious, clean, and private. The food at the onsite restraunt was always very good. The resort was 20 min from the beach, walking, but even closer to clubs, restraunts, and shops.  While the resort was amazing, walking anywhere you had to watch your step along what little sidewalk area that was available as there were open spaces with the drainage system below.  There was a shuttle which left 3 times a day to the  beach.  When you exchange your money for rupiah make certain that the money changer is part of a larger institution as one had a sign that the exchange rates can fluctuate without notice.  Which they did as soon as we had signed the form which had a blank space for the exchange rate!  The moneychangers closer to the beach offer poorer exchange rates than those a few blocks inland.  The traffic is insane and I recommend utilizing the taxis for any major traveling.  Taxi rates can be variable, negotiate before you get in the taxi and keep in mind that there are quite a few drivers that for $40 - $50 USD will spend the entire day taking you wherever you want.  Bali was fascinating and I will definitely return someday.",

They attended our requests very efficient.  We truly feel welcomed here. The villa is clean and have all stuff you may need. Breakfast is nice. We had a lunch in their restaurant which is very nice too. \n\nCons: Too many mosquitos inside the villa. not sure if any other solution can be done except have to place the coil everywhere to chase them out. At night we have to use the electric insect repeller, spray& 2 mosquitos coil to avoid get bite. the smell made our eyes very uncomfortable. The door of the living room is very tight and a bit hard to open.\n\nOverall we had a very relax and happy holiday in the club, great team of staff!",

              "text": "Just completed my 3-night stay over the weekend. 5-stars for services, 2-stars for villa condition. The condition of the first villa assigned to us was less than ideal. The customer service team responded to my feedback quickly and moved us to another villa of better condition.  \n\nAs mentioned in many of the posts before, the condition of the villas is rather rundown and much less than the usual Anantara standard. The mosquito problem here is significant, and will be even more so if you are here like me with a young kid. It is near impossible to enjoy the lovely yard unless you stay in the pool or doused yourself with insect repellent. Mosquito activity peaks at dusk. So much so that you get a constant buzzing around your ears if you stay outdoors and you will get a fair bit sneaking into the room as well. Have to keep my baby son under the mosquito net upon night fall.\n\nWhile the state of the villas is not in non-liveable condition, it is definitely rundown and not worthy if Anantara wants to brand itself as \"Asia's leading _luxury_ shared ownership concept\". \n\nMy wife very impressed when she stayed here 3 years back when it was still \"Ranadi Villas\". She was full of expectations when we found out that Anantara took over. You can only imagine her disappointment.\n\nNonetheless, kudos to the warm and wonderful service given by Jonathan and team. I have nothing but praises for them. The stay will be perfect if I get Jonathan's team in a location that is true to Anantara standard. Good job, team Jonathan!",

The villa have simple design but very cozy and convenience. The bedroom is a bit darker( I don't mind with that, since the room is for sleeping) but you may have the bright lighter in the living room. The bath room is well arranged with shower area, toilet and bathtub area. I really enjoy watch the TV in the living room. The kitchen in the living room is fantastic! . You may have the most complete tableware here. Refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, water cooker, teabags, rice cooker, knife set, spoon set, plate, glass for water, wine, coffe, tea, iron, iron table, insect repeller, etc. The private pool is an additional value to this villa. Overall, I am very satisfy with my 2night stay in this place.",

The food in the restaurant is good, we order pizza for dinner. The room is clean, unique and kitchen appliances are complete. The bathroom is big and comfortably clean.The location is good and in a quite area, but easy to find various restaurants and cafe. But actually we expect more before we arrived.Tthe hotel facility is very limited. One washing machine and 2 dryer machines for the whole villa are not enough, always being occupied when we want to use it. The light in the bedroom is too dark. Too many mosquitoes, especially when the evening came. The beach is too far and not convinience for kids. We hope that we can find more in other Anantara Vacation Club properties in our next holiday.",

I myself am 2 metres tall and have always found them to be very comfortable, to the extent that I have the same beds at my personal residence! My apologies if you were expecting a Super King. However, this is definately something we can look in to.\r\n\r\nWith regards to the pools, while the villa pools are not as large as our main pool, most of our owners find them adequate for a refreshing dip and even for doing a few lengths in the morning.\r\n\r\nAnd in terms of location, while I understand that you would have perhaps preferred to be closer to the beach, as you pointed out, we do provide a shuttle service that only takes a few minutes before you are relaxing on the beach with a cocktail in your hand!\r\n\r\nI was however pleased to hear that the service and staff at the resort met with your expectations. We are very lucky to have such a good team and are constantly reviewing our services and facilities to ensure we are providing our guests with the very best.\r\n\r\nThank you for once again for your comments. Please feel free to contact me directly should I be able to offer any further assistance.\r\n\r\nKind Regards\r\n\r\nJonathan Sweeney-Lowe\r\nDirector of Resort Operations",

Service is still great as usual but the pool is quite small and the lights in the room are way too dim. The villa seems smaller I guess because the room and kitchen are separated. What disappointed us the most is the size of the property and how there is only one restaurant. We understand that the other Anantara is only a few mins away by car but it's just not convenient to go there for food and spa considering the shuttle is only available three times a day. Maybe it's a personal preference but when we stay at a resort, we expect full facilities.",

PT Azzahra Maulana. the rate may not be as good but you are guaranteed your money's worth. some money changers at souvenir shop fronts offer good rates but take you to the back lane to exchange currency. you are at their mercy then and likely you might be cheated.\nBy the way, at the airport, go to the Airport Taxi counter. tell them where you are headed and they will let you know how much it cost and give you a booking slip. To head back to the airport, ask the hotel to call for Blue Bird cab. it only costs us 70,000 rupiah to airport.",

I apologise for the inconveniences you experienced and thank you for taking the time to discuss the specifics of them with me over the phone today.\r\n\r\nI was glad to be afforded the opportunity to explain to you that due to the 100% occupancy of the hotel during your stay, while it was not possible to change your room immediately, we did move you to a different villa as soon as one became available, where you confirmed that there were no further issues with the hot water in the shower.\r\n\r\nRegarding the insect on your bed in the first villa, as explained over the phone today, while we do everything possible to reduce guest exposure to Bali's natural inhabitants with regular fogging, it is impossible to guarantee that you will not see any insects during your visit. They do live here as much as we do!\r\n\r\nI must however thank you for bringing to our attention the fact that out TV Cable provider was not broadcasting the world cup matches! While I apologise that your husband was disappointed by this, you will be pleased to know that we have since addressed this issue and the World Cup matches are now available in the villas thanks to you.\r\n\r\nThank you for once again for your comments, and feel free to contact me directly should I be able to offer any further assistance.\r\n\r\nKind Regards\r\n\r\nJonathan Sweeney-Lowe\r\nDirector of Resort Operations",

              "text": "I had booked one 2 bedroom villa and 1 single bedroom villa for my group. The welcome at the resort was warm and our rooms were ready. The walk to the rooms does feel a bit strange as they are in one straight line and as a result it does not feel like a resort. The 2 bedroom villa is really spacious...The rooms are well furnished...the bathrooms are fancy and the middle living area and kitchen looks inviting. We used the private pool on both days and well its was good but I was always unsure about the cleanliness of the water since its open air. One of the drawbacks of the property is that the lighting in all the rooms is poor so it does become kinda depressing towards the evening. The resort is close to the Seminyak market but quite far from the beach and you have to cab it to any of the happening spots. I had to sit through a presentation with my wife on the 2nd day and go through the sales pitch of the Vacation Club staff. I did find them a bit insistent even after I had indicated that it would not suit my holiday style. I would rate the staff and service as friendly. Breakfast was ok and you had to choose from a set menu. There are a couple of cheap and good massages just outside the hotel which you should try. So the rating on the property is that it will suit you if you are traveling with a large group and if you like vacations clubs...I would prefer the full service beach resorts in Nusa Dua if you are in Bali.",

The reception was very knowledgeable about the places to visit and the timings and what to expect. The food was good.\nWould have been perfect if the place was nicer.

I apologise for any misunderstanding or inconvenience caused. While it is true that we are not a beach front property, we do offer a shuttle to the Anantara Seminyak (only 5 mins away), where you can enjoy sunset cocktails on the beach on their beach lawn.\r\n\r\nI was however happy to learn that you felt well taken care of by the staff and were extremely satisfied with the service you received during your stay, as well as having enjoyed our F&B offerings here at the Club Resort. \r\nI am blessed with an excellent team!\r\n\r\nYou will be pleased to know that we have just completed some refurbishments which have addressed what were some of the more weathered areas of the resort and she is now looking revitalised, ready for your next visit. \r\n\r\nThank you for once again for your comments, and feel free to contact me directly should I be able to offer any further assistance.\r\n\r\nKind Regards\r\n\r\nJonathan Sweeney-Lowe\r\nDirector of Resort Operations",

              "text": "Our stay at Anantara Vacation Club Bali Seminyak was average and not up to expectation, considering that it is one of the Anantara properties. \n\nWe stayed at the pool villa for 3 nights and the villa itself is quite beautiful. If you are looking for privacy and a quiet environment, it would be a suitable place. However, the vacation club is situated in town surrounded by walls which does not give a holiday feeling. There are also very few facilities and the main pool is not so attractive.\n\nThe vacation club is also a bit far from the beach and its so called \"beach club\" is ridiculous. It is just a few umbrellas and beach chairs at a deserted stretch along the coastline. We had to use a dirty bathroom of the restaurant nearby. Luckily, we were able to use the facilities of its sister hotel Anantara Seminyak Resort & Spa with a minimum spending on food & beverage. Its main pool and beach bar are very decent. The service there is a lot better than the vacation club. We could see more staff with smiley faces. \n\nThe quality of food at the vacation club's restaurant and in-room dining was average (but the Bali flavour pizza was excellent). We would not recommend its Babi Kuling which was disappointing (there is a reputable Babi Kuling place nearby but we did not have a chance to try). For dining options adjacent to the vacation club, you could go to the main street (around 5 minutes by taxi) with a lot of restaurants. Otherwise, the restaurants at Anantara Seminyak Resort & Spa are also nice. \n\nThe WIFI at the vacation club was annoying. We had to key in the specific login name and password on its login page every time when we wanted to use the WIFI.",

This change will take place with immediate effect thanks to your feedback.\r\n\r\nI was however disappointed that you felt there were more smiley faces at the Anantara Seminyak. It is usually the high level of personalised service from our small, intimate boutique style that owners enjoy here at Anantara Vacation Club Bali. I have passed on your comments to the team to review and investigate.\r\n\r\nI am glad that you enjoyed our Bali Pizza...it is excellent...I would have to agre! :) I am sorry that you did not enjoy our other offerings. The chef is currently working on a new menu which will be launched shortly and available for your next visit!\r\n\r\nThank you for once again for your comments, and feel free to contact me directly should I be able to offer any further assistance.\r\n\r\nKind Regards\r\n\r\nJonathan Sweeney-Lowe\r\nDirector of Resort Operations",

I apologise for any inconvenience caused. While it is true that we are not a beachfront property, we do offer a shuttle service to the Anantara Seminyak (only 5 mins down the road), where you may enjoy sunset cocktails on the beach using their pool and beach lawn facilities.\r\n\r\nI was however surprised that the service at the resort did not meet with your expectations. Given the intimate, boutique style of the Club, it is often the personalised service we offer that owners enjoy most here at Anantara Vacation Club Bali Seminyak. Please feel free to contact me personally if you would like to address any issues in particular regarding your stay.\r\n\r\nI have passed your comments about the pushiness of the sales team to the Director of Sales to discuss and review with her team. \r\n\r\nThank you for once again for your comments, and feel free to contact me directly should I be able to offer any further assistance and we look forward to welcoming you back to the resort in the future.\r\n\r\nKind Regards\r\n\r\nJonathan Sweeney-Lowe\r\nDirector of Resort Operations",

We had free breakfast included which you could either enjoy at the pool or sent to your room. We definitely had an amazing experience at this resort and highly recommend it for all.

Ticks every box for us, good aircon in rooms, great breakfast. Staff are wonderful. One of us had a fall/slip in a rainstorm requiring an exam at hospital. The staff went out of their way to arrange wheelchair, car and driver, and Dewa stayed with us to navigate the hospital experience. Thankfully just some bruised torn muscles, no fractures etc, but we would have been a tad lost without Dewa to help. He even grabbed copies of our passports they had on file for us, as needed by the hospital. We hadn\u2019t even thought of that at the time. We\u2019ll be back in a few months. Thankyou Avani staff for all your help!",

The Villas are ideal for a couple or small family, and the Avani has all the amenities you need (great gym, but no spa sadly). But the best thing about this place is the staff, who were outstanding, very thoughtful and went out of their way to make us feel at home. We stay in Anantaras and Avanis a lot....and I can safely say that the staff here are the best we have encountered in Asia. Dewa and Prida were amazing - looking after us even when my wife got sick! \n\nThanks for a lovely stay guys. ",

The one-bed pool villa was nicely appointed and we were able to stay with our teen daughter who slept on the pull out bed in the lounge. The highlight was the staff however. So friendly and helpful; I was sick for a few days and they looked after me really well, sending fresh ginger tea to the room and rice porridge. Thank you to the management and staff for making me feel better more quickly!",

I would like commend all the staff that helped me for their professionalism and dedication to go the extra mile. From the reservation team who recommended me the services they can provide to the front desk team who coordinated with me in discreet to all the staff that helped in the floral arrangement and the BBQ.

Main bathroom was spacious. Balcony was a great spot to hang out. Block out curtains worked well.  Pillows were soft, though bed was a little hard. \n\nLocation - Short walk to the main Seminyak shopping areas. The resort is down this beautifully presented drive way. Pool was not too small given the amount of people who use the facilities.\n\nStaff - All amazing and friendly. Loved them all. \n\nWe would 100% recommend this resort.",

              "text": "This has to be the best boutique villa resort we have ever stayed..ever! \n\nThe location of the resort is pretty near to the Seminyak beach which is only about 10mins away. However, it is very near to the Seminyak shopping and dining venues like Seminyak Square or the Flea Market areas. Location is also very peaceful and quiet within a villa neighbourhood and it gets you away from the bustling nightlife area after a day of shopping and play which was fantastic for us! There is even a golfcart service provided to bring us to the nearby Anantara properties for spa and dining options as well where guests are provided further discounts!\n\nThe quiet and cosy resort is very well maintained with beautiful landscape areas nicely manicured by the hardworking gardeners everyday while we stayed there. Check-in process was a breeze with the concierge helping with the luggage once we arrived at the reception. Our 1 bedroom pool villa was fantastic and beautifully decorated with the local flavours of Bali. The private villa pool is a welcoming sight for us as well and we had the 2nd option of the main pool at the side of the restaurant. The deck chairs beside the villa pool allows guests to relax and unwind in private which is great. There is also a small kids club play area and a library room within the main reception building together with the main sitting area which was beautifully renovated during the pandemic.\n\nOur bedroom in the villa was huge for the 2 of us and the bathroom was also nicely laid out. There is even a bottle of bath salt that was refilled daily for your bath tub soak to relax the day away. Another shower head at the outdoor area of the toilet will be nice too. A tote bag and sarong are available in the wardobe for us to use when we go to places of attractions which was very thoughtful. LED TV in the room is also large with clear reception of international satellite channels. However the LED TV at the living room did not have clear reception and thus we only watched the programmes in the bedroom.  Kitchenette is also fully equipped and great for small snacks. The only issue we had was that the wall of the bedroom seems to be thin and may need further sound insulation as we can hear the conversations of other guests passing by from within our room.\n\nBreakfast was served daily at the restaurant via ala carte style with nice pool view and I must say the spread was fantastic! We were greeted warmly daily by the F&B teams by name and they really did a commendable job! Especially the young trainee Mr Yoga who really treated us like close friends and not just guests. We tried the local dishes for dinner too and we were not disappointed. Afternoon tea with their mocktails was also something that we are very happy with.\n\nWe would like to sincerely thank Pak Made Subrata, the GM whom gave us such warm hospitality during our stay and Pak Ardi and his team who took very good care of us from the day we arrived. Other than recommendations of nearby attractions, he even offered to send us around the vicinity when he is available so that we can get there safely and comfortably. Truely commendable and top notch service from the entire team at Avani Seminyak! We are truely missing Bali and Avani again!",

              "text": "Stayed for 10 nights with my wife. I don't know why many said 10 nights were too long but just nice for us. Based on the other reviews, similar experience for us, hospitality is always good in most places in Bali, they always greet guests. First 9 nights was staying in the apartment but was upgraded to pool villa on our last night, thanks to the push from AVC. Will definitely opt for the pool villa next time we are back. To us this resort is better than AVC Legian, more Balinese style and quieter.\n\nBreakfast was unfortunately limited in choices but nothing wrong with the taste. If you are staying long like us you might be bored with it, but me and my wife are ok. Entering the narrow driveway gives you a sense of exploration. Location to us was not too bad as we rented scooter and a car. You can definitely walk out to search for food and drinks.\n\nMy wife noticed an Australian lady commenting about the music played during breakfast. She suggested to play Balinese songs rather and pop songs for a more relaxing breakfast. The next day the restaurant did changed it, good to know they do take guest comments into action.\n\nJust one thing that keeps bugging me, for the entire 10 days of breakfast we had, we were asked for our room number each day, even by the similar waiters/waitresses. Not much as issue actually but would be good if you do make an effort to remember your guests' room number or even their names. Don't think peak or not peak season has any effect on the effort.",

Perfect for our escape from busy city life. The location is smack in middle of Seminyak\u2019s hip restaurants tho we spent a lot of time dining indoors with their great room service! The staff were excellent and ever ready to assist. Enjoyed every minute of our stay",

We liked it so much that we cancelled accommodation booked elsewhere and stayed an extra night in a one bed apartment. This room was just as nice with a huge balcony. The staff were all fantastic and so friendly, special thankyou to Alfred from the restaurant, he was so friendly and welcoming every time we visited the restaurant, he was also so attentive to our one year old son, Alfred would greet him and constantly waved and smiled at him which he just loved. We will definitely be staying here again our next Bali trip, I can't imagine staying anywhere else now we have found this gem! Thankyou to all the front office and restaurant staff for making our stay so enjoyable.",

The rooms are fantastic and the pool area is beautiful. We cannot recommend this place enough. The kitchen has great food and within minutes walk are so many other places to eat. Turn right outside the resort and 50m on the right is a fantastic seafood place to eat. Turn left and 20m is Hibiscus who do the best Nasi Goreng for $7 Aussie.\nAvani is really 5 star and we\u2019ve stayed all\naround the world in timeshare for 15 years.\nWe will be back next year and this time take a private villa with own pool.

It even had a fully equipped kitchen which would be quite convenient on a longer stay. Everything was clean and looked like almost new. It's not a huge resort and restaurant, pool etc are on the smaller side too but we think that this isn't a disadvantage. It feels more personal and comfy this way. The most important point last : service and friendliness of all staff was really excellent . We can definitely recommend the Avani. \n\n",

If you felt like a walk to one of the Main Street near Seminyak square it was just a quick 12 min walk or a quick taxi trip. Customer servuce was great, everyone going out of their way to acknowledge you. We stayed in a one bedroom pool villa. Great size and modern features. Most important was the comfortable bed, which is hard to find in Bali.  If something needed attention, they were there within a flash. Another great feature is the free guest laundry station. To have access to a washing machine and dryer after a few days was a god send.",

              "text": "We are finishing up our stay at Avani and I just want to say it\u2019s been beyond wonderful.\n\nIt\u2019s our first time to Bali and we wanted to be near the shops but also the beach. We also had to take our 18 month old into consideration. We booked a two bedroom apartment and upon arrival at Avani we were upgraded to an apartment with plunge pool!\n\nThe apartment is massive, so airy and peaceful. We have our own kitchen as well which has been wonderful for cleaning baby bottles etc. The bathrooms are pristine and the beds are super comfy. Having a baby you need reliable wifi (for the white noise) and black out blinds (which ee brought with and didn\u2019t need to use!) the rooms have excellent curtains which block out the light so you get a great nights sleep.\n\nThe plunge pool is brilliant to cool off on a hot day and just chill around, especially while baby naps. I\u2019m equally impressed by the locks on the door going out to the pool. I am so fearful about that kind of thing, especially around a toddler who cannot swim. \n\nThere are washing machines and dryers they are in great condition and FREE to use. This means we don\u2019t have to do all that annoying post holiday washing back at home! \n\nThere is a bigger pool on site which is brilliant as well as a restaurant. You can have your breakfast in the restaurant or you can have it in the apartment. We love to have it in the apartment as it means our toddler can eat and run around. We don\u2019t have to worry about her becoming annoyed in the high chair for too long. The breakfast you order off a menu. It\u2019s delicious, filling and presented so beautifully. \n\nThere is a shuttle bus that does drop offs and pickups to the beach three times a day. Very very handy. When we haven\u2019t wanted to walk, we have just caught a taxi/blue bird for $3 to basically any street of shopping/restaurants in Seminyak. Super easy! \n\nThe biggest stand out for us has been the staff. We have stayed at many five star resorts across Asia and we have never been somewhere where EVERY single member of staff you meet is just so kind and willing to assist you. From Frieda at the front desk to Nyoman  doubt I have spelt it right, apologies!) who was working on the pristine gardens everyone is just so kind. It was my birthday here and they saw the birthdate on my passport and organised a cake for me! Front desk has also given us a late check out because we have a baby with us and they acknowledged she will need a nap and asked us if the late checkout would work for us.\n\nIf you\u2019re staying in Seminyak for the first time or you have a child, I would definitely recommend the Avani! \n\nThank you to all the staff who work so hard to make it so wonderful.",

This accomodation is perfect for people wanted to stay in the quiet parts of Seminyak but also a short walk from the main streets and beach. The closest beach was only a 15 minute walk, Avani also offer a beach shuttle bus to Seminyak beach. The staff were very helpful at recommending the best places to visit in the area and very accomodating. Highly recommend the private pool villas.",

From the minute we arrived we were greeted with such kindness and felt welcomed straight away! We stayed in a pool villa which was amazing and peaceful and it got cleaned everyday! The restaurant was incredible with lots of delicious food options for breakfast lunch and dinner! The facilities were great that we could do our washing, go to the gym, use the pool and so many more! The staff were always happy with a smile on their face and we cannot wait to return to avani the next time we come back to bali! Thank you Avani we love you <3!!",

It was clearly the best hotel that we have stayed in Bali thus far. The rooms were well-appointed, and many amenities available. It has a fully functional kitchen which is quite crazy. The only problem we had was the bathtub which is constantly leaking off water, we took almost an hour to setup the bubble bath. \n\nWe also tried the dinner and breakfast at Groove and the food quality is incredible, very reasonable prices. Our stay comes with a bunch of dining coupons so it is actually cheaper than outside, they also allow in-room dining so makes all the more to just stay in. \n\nThe Villa comes with a 4 metre lap pool that you can get some chill time, we basically spent our last day in the villa and had a lazy day. It was so good. The service here is great too, they had beach shuttle service to the Seminyak beaches, laundry etc etc. \n\nIt is a 5-star stay but yet very wallet friendly, we will come back again for sure.",

We took the free shuttle to the beach one day, but decided to walk back to do more exploring.\nOur one bedroom pool villa was very comfortably furnished, with effective air conditioning and ceiling fans in both rooms. There were bathrobes and slippers plus lots of extras including insect repellant, hand sanitizers and large bottles of drinking water. There were three showers and two toilets. The bathroom included a lovely, free-standing bath tub and large, eco-friendly toiletry dispensers. The kitchen was well equipped, although we didn\u2019t use it, as there were loads of great local restaurants nearby.\nAll members of staff we met, from front of house and security to gardeners, housekeeping and waitstaff in the restaurant, were exemplary, being friendly, efficient and helpful. Pre-stay emails were answered promptly, all my questions were answered  and requests granted. As a Titanium Discovery member, I received a double accommodation upgrade, a fruit platter and a late checkout. \nThe a la carte breakfast was very good; nicely prepared and well presented, with quite a few choices. All of this considered, it\u2019s terrific value for money!",

Very spacious, well lit, sockets conveniently located and all with a fully equipped kitchen. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Seminyak, and what great value for all that is provided.

It was very easy to call the hotel buggy if we didn\u2019t feel like walking the path to breakfast.\nMeals are served in the open restaurant looking over the pool and the food was delicious. Breakfast was ample and served at the table. \nThe hotel was very clean and hygienic, with staff masked all the time and hand sanitiser in our apartment.\nIt was very quiet at the pool so we had no trouble getting one of the 4 cabanas. It was a pity that one of the villa guests took the pool\u2019s inflatable flamingo and didn\u2019t return it as I heard children asking for it.\nThere are washing machines and dryers for those needing to was their clothes.\nIt\u2019s a great little place with lovely staff, and I would happily return",

Breakfast was great, staffs are friendly, shuttle car to Seminyak Beach available on call, you got everything you needed. Can only recommend this place, dont think twice to book!",

Location was good too, 5 mins away from a few really good cafes and 10mins walk away from popular restaurants. Shuttle service is also provided to and fro the beach at selected timings during the day. Rooms were great, very clean and really private. Was told that there would be mosquitoes and understand that it's unavoidable, but mosquito coils and repellents were provided, which was really appreciated! If it's really anything that can be improved, it would be that the private pool can be slightly cleaner and that the taste of the breakfast can also be better. \nDespite that, we would definitely return, without a doubt!",

Really nice people. Food and drinks was also delicious, we took full advantage of the happy hour two for one cocktails! Also very reasonable prices for great quality.

On the right there is a big bed room with king size bed, table to work, wardrobe and enough space to wonder around. The bathroom has a big window with the bathtub next to it, then separate toilet, separate indoor shower with rainshower head and normal one, PLUSSS another outdoor shower area. Privacy is quaranteed.\n\nOn the other side of  the villa is the kitchen area, fully equipped so that you can do your own meal if you'd like, although ordering from their kitchen will not disappoint. There is a sofa and table there, along with TV. \n\nThen there is the swimming pool and another outdoor sitting area where breakfast were served and 2 lounge chair to sun tan if interested.  \n\nIn the property there is also a washing machine and dryer that can be used by the guests for free. Ideal for longer stay.\n\nDespite being in close by to Seminyak main road, it is very quiet! Service was excellent and the whole villa was clean.",

I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever come across such friendly and welcoming hotel staff before. They were attentive and made sure our stay was fantastic. Location is nice and central, about a 5 minute walk from shopping areas with plenty of restaurants in either direction. 15 minute walk from the beach and various beach front bars which suited us (taxis and scooters are easily available if not wanting to walk) Would happily stay there again!",

              "text": "Had an excellent stay at the Avani vila resorts. We stayed in the 2 bedroom villa with pool. It was definitely too big for two people, but it was great to have all the extra space and extra bathroom! A big shout out to Frida who helped us secure an amazing last minute price. She was lovely and always made time to chat to see how we were doing. In fact, everyone at Avani was super friendly and was always on hand to help. The villa itself was great - we loved the massive pool that connected to the living room. You could just open the living door and step into the pool! The beds were big and comfy, the bathrooms were nice and big (although the toilet do need replacing, mine was a bit wobbly). The kitchenette area was functional, but a bit tired and probably needs updating. And if you ever have time to watch TV, I'd say the TVs were a bit old and the sound came out tinny and hard to hear unless you turned it up really loud. The location was great - about 7 min walk from all the restaurants and shops. There's a mall about a 20 minute walk away and same for the beach. I'd recommend a scooter/car to get around tho, unless you only want to stay in the Seminyak area. They have parking at the resort, so no need to worry about that. Overall, we had a great time and would definitely stay again!",

It\u2019s excellent , very kind and personal service staff , always pleasant and caring. \n\nPremises very clean and well maintained all these years. Air-conditioning and wifi excellent. Food is good and well plated. Breakfast spread served with good variety of local, Asian delights and Balinese/Indo style cuisine. \n\nMy husband and I have always enjoyed our stay very much and always wish we have more time to indulge in this tropical environment with its nicely manicured landscape. \n\nEasily reached within 20 mins from the airport, many other good restaurants within walking distance, easily accessible to beach too. \n\nThis resort is also good for family with its swimming pool facilities, playroom for young kids, and well-contained kitchenette.\n\nHighly recommended for its price and luxury.",

Early Check in \nCalled the hotel at 1130am to check if an early check in at 1pm is possible, staff mentioned that my room was ready for check-in in the next 1 hour. How amazing. \n\n2. Room upgrade \nBooked a 2 BR suite and was upgraded to suite with a plunge pool. The staff brought us to our room and even showed us around. They also provide washer and dryer for free! Even the detergent was provided. \n\n3. Room\nRoom was huge, clean, well equipped with a full kitchen and very well maintained. If you do drink ALOT of water, the resort provided an option to have a water dispenser in your room at a small fee, alternatively they  provide bottled water. All rooms, living area and pool area had ceiling fans too. Wifi was fast, took a video conference call and there was no bandwidth issue. Housekeeping staff were also very helpful and friendly! Although we were staying at the far end, there are buggy services available. \n\n4. F&B/Staff \nFood were reasonably priced for a luxury resort. I had a chance to order room service and dine in at the restaurant for breakfast. Ordered a breakfast set to takeaway as my friend woke up late, they staff offered to deliver the breakfast to the room. They even recognized me the next day and asked if I wanted to order breakfast for my friend whom is still not awake yet. Lastly the guards, FO staff, F&B, housekeeping staff were nothing short of amazing! Kudos to the whole team keeping their smiles on despite having a full house over the long weekend. \n\nLastly, checkout was a breeze. We had informed the staff of our checkout time in advance. 5 Mins after we checked out, one of the staff told us they found a charger in our room. Wasn't expecting them to had checked the room for us all within 5 mins.\n\nThank you for the amazing hospitality!",

Pool was polluted as filter systems appears to be insufficient.\n\nAs we have paid more than 150 USD net, this was to be expected and their room levels appear to be very artificial.\n\nDuring breakfast we were told that an omelette together with a very simple nasi goreng as well as even a 2nd would coffee would be chargeable.  No service attention and attitude during the breakfast.\n\nAfter we left the breakfast with this experience, we were called on our room that we can have a 2nd coffee without charge.\nIncredible and ridiculous.\n\nWhen we wanted to check out, we were told that the room needs to be checked first before we can check out making us feeling like criminals.\nThe reception did bot recognize when we wanted to check out even we called before from the room.\n\nIncredible service experience for this price.\n\nDon't spend more than 60-max70 USD++ and only if you have low expectations. We are surprised that GHA Discovery is not auditing this place.\n\nWe would rather choose any other 4* or even 5* property for this price",

My most since apologies for these shortfalls in product and service, this is certainly not the stay experience we wish our guest to have.\n\nWe have completed a thorough internal investigation as to where we went wrong and what areas may need improvement, likes pool water system circulation, upgrading on breakfast menu varieties & options and staff training, expediate checkout process meanwhile still ensuring no guest belonging left behind. Thank you again for sharing your comments and allowing us the opportunity to identify areas of our service standards that may need enhancing.\n\nOnce again, our sincere apologies for any inconvenience you faced during your stay and look forward to welcoming you back for another opportunity in future. \n \nStay well and best regards,\n\n\nMade Subrata \nGeneral Manager \nAvani Seminyak Bali Resort ",

So those of you who personally drive your car should be mindful.\n\nWe stayed in the 2BR Apartment with plunge pool and the amenities are very complete. They have all the necessities for a full-functioning apartment. Right across our room is a laundromat which is free to use for in-house guest. The hotel even provided the detergent for that.\n\nIn terms of experience, we can say that 95% of the interaction with the hotel service is of the highest standard, hence nothing to complain about. The restaurant was especially helpful, replacing unsatisfactory order with a new much better food.\n\nIn retrospect, there is no reason for us not to stay there again.

We got the standard room and was like an apartment style with a balcony area and kitchenette and living room. We were fortunate to have really hot sunny days in the low rainy season, so having a day bed by the pool area everyday was fantastic. \nThere was also a free laundry area with amenities included which was handy\n\nGroove Restaurant food was fantastic catering for all cuisines times with happy hours drinks. The staff at the hotel was absolutely beautiful, friendly and accommodating, which made our stay even more magical. The location was very convenient with only  5- 10 minutes walk to the main shopping, restaurant area and had a free shuttle to the sister hotel located on the beach with more option for food and drinks. \nWe found it surprisingly quiet as we were located in a popular area making it busy but couldn't hear any traffic or noise, even at the general pool area.  Would definitely recommend and come back for a  longer visit.",

Service was above expectations because they were so accommodating to all our needs. My mother got hurt and they offered the buggie to drive her to our room and our flight was delayed they let us wait in the air conned waiting room. They offered us masks to prevent coronavirus. The food at the resort is delicious and highly recommend the grilled fish rice dish which we ordered repeatedly. The staff were very friendly when we walk past they all say hello and welcome which made it feel like a family. We would definitely come back again because of this great service. Highly recommend this hotel to anyone thinking about going to Bali! Thanks for making it such a great experience!",

The concierge staff in particular were extremely friendly, always greeted us by name and were very happy to go the extra mile for us. For example, they were always happy to help us speak to the Grab drivers whenever the Grab drivers got lost and could not find the resort. On separate occasions we also left an umbrella at Merah Putih restaurant and a watch at Cafe Del Mar beach club, and the staff went the extra mile to contact those places to help us to retrieve our belongings. Overall, the service was faultless from every single staff we encountered in the resort.\n\nThe villa, while not the newest, was kept very neat and clean and always well-stocked with amenities. We could not find any fault with the villa facilities. The resort is also quite conveniently located and we were happy to walk out to the main Seminyak walking area from the resort. It is also a short Grab or taxi ride away to the best Seminyak restaurants and beach clubs like Potato Head and Mrs Sippy. \n\nOverall, we had a perfect experience at Avani Seminyak and unreservedly recommend it to anyone who is thinking of staying in Seminyak. We would come back to stay here on our next visit without question.   ",

The Resort itself is beautiful and not over crowded which was lovely, gorgeous pool area with cabanas close to the restaurant for cocktails. \nThe stand out feature of Avani is the beautiful & friendly staff which made our stay so much more relaxed! A special shout out to Frida @ reception who was amazing to deal with and always greeted us with a friendly smile and chat, she made our stay stress free!! \nThe resort is also going through more exciting updates so we cant wait to bring our families back to stay again!! Thankyou again to all the beautiful staff @ Avani Seminyak!! \"Terima Kasi\" \ud83e\udd70\ud83c\udf34\ud83c\udf3a",

I know they are owned by the same company but the lovely staff are wearing mixed uniforms and branding across the resort is mixed with Anatara and Avani - seems odd. We stayed for 7 days in a Pool Villa - very dated and old, a lot of work around the edges needs to be done. Villa is spacious and pool is lovely. It should not be listed as a 4.5 star property. We had a half board option in our package, the meals in the only restaurant are very limited and very poor quality. Staff are amazing and very accommodating.  ",

The private pool was a delight and we also enjoyed the main pool at the resort.  The staff are super friendly and efficient.  Our private pool was cleaned first thin in the morning and the whole villa (bedroom, bathroom, kitchenette and court yard) was maintained to perfection each day.  Every evening our room was sprayed for mosquitoes and there were mosquito coils burning in the open area which was awesome.  Breakfast was filling and good and here also the staff were able to cater to any of our requests.  The villa is walking distance to the major places and there  is a shuttle to and from the beach during the day.  Awesome place.  I recommend this hotel.  ",

The unit was spacious and clean and the location was perfect for waking to the main strip or the beach. \n\nThe pool was deep and larger than expected. Also loved that the unit had a second washroom. They supplied all the amenities including bug spray and a mosquito coil which they light every night. We didn\u2019t get any big bites there. \n\nAlso very impressed with the on site restaurant. The food was delicious and on par in terms of price with other restaurants in the area so we were happy to order from them regularly. If you do decide to venture offsite we really enjoyed Hibiscus restaurant which is a few doors down. \n\nThere is a Circle K next door where you can buy drinks and snacks. We also changed our money there a few times and were never shorted. \n\nOverall would highly recommend. I wish we were closer so we could come back again. ",

Would recommend staying here, location fantastic nearby to restaurants and bars. A short taxi ride away from all the day clubs of Seminyak, Canggu, Jimbarran, Kuta, and the airport. Transfers were included and very useful as wouldn't like to arrange my own pickup at Bali airport. The food was great, good for quiet drinks before heading out. All the staff so happy and could not do more for you. We booked an extra night as night flights back to Sydney, and the hotel was perfect for the last day relaxing by the pool, the only couple at the pool all day! We had a hotel room, but there were lots of private villas with their own pools where we thought most people may have been, or at the many day clubs. We are British living down under, and the day clubs definitely had an Ibiza feel about them!",

We booked through luxury escapes and we were not disappointed! \nOur package included breakfast everyday and lunch OR dinner daily. The food you do get included is good quality and a generous size. You can even ask to have the food delivered to your room if you want. \n\nThe staff were all so beautiful. Smiling and welcoming and happy to help with whatever we needed. We were genuinely sad to leave. \n\nThe rooms are comfortable and have facilities available for cooking etc. but we didn\u2019t use them as we ate at the villa restaurant but the fridge comes in handy for water and drinks if you want to buy your own. \n\nThe location is great - close enough to the Main Street or the beach if you want to walk or cheap enough to get a taxi (about 7-10 thousand rupiah). There is also a convenience store about a 2 minute walk and a money exchange which we used and had no issues with. \n\nOverall we loved our stay and we will definitely be back! ",

The only flaw was they missed cleaning our room on the 18th November and we had to reuse our bath towels They should have a system in place for recording which rooms they have cleaned so they do not miss on a particular room which was not very nice as we were short on amenities. Since we were checking out very early  the next day & tired out after a day out we left it at that otherwiseits a pleasant stay",

Very friendly and helpful with everything. The also gave advice and tips to help a first time visitor to Bali get the best value and not get ripped off. The Serai restaurant had beautiful food where we often ate and the room service we realised had no extra charge.\nThere are many complimentary benefits such as all toiletries (inc. soap, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, toothbrush & paste, vanity kits, shower caps, sanitary bags, insect repellant, sunscreen) were restocked daily; fresh linen daily, birthday cake for my sons birthday, activities and lessons, laundry appliances and detergent, wake up calls, mosquito management staff, baggage storage for late checkout and much more.\nBeautiful and inviting from the moment you go down the drive way. The pictures are what you get.\nVery accommodating staff that placed more family that arrived days later very close by.\nI was not disappointed one bit.",

But being part of a resort club you would think asking for basic repairs would not be needed. I would suggest either having rooms checked periodically by a quality assurance person or training your staff to actually report issues that are going to be an issue with a guest and avoid the actual complaint process.

Very spacious, well equipped and the staff were not just smiling and courteous, they went out of their way to meet our every need. \n\nWe did order room service and it was quickly brought and very delicious. Since we had a fully equipped kitchen, we cooked alot and ate out alot though. \n\nAvani Seminyak was a member only resort , I was told, which has recently been opened to the public and I would highly recommend these villas to honeymooners and families. \n\nThe pool in the villas is 1.4 m deep and very satisfying for swimming and frolicking. The main pool opposite the reception has a very shallow end safe for toddlers. \n\nThe airport pick up service was most convenient and available for midnight arrivals too. The free drop offs and pick ups to the beach was most convenient, and the staff would adjust the schedule to our timings when no other guests. \n\nLast but not the least, I praise the reservation staff who communicated regularly and helped arrange upgrades , airport transfers and baby-sitter well before we arrived.\n\nFrankly, I admit to being a fussy traveller, but, no complaints here \uff01",

The arrival experience was excellent and our departure experience was seamless. Although our schedule was tight, the front desk team helped us make arrangements to make it comfortable.\nLaundry- Agus\n-He was proactive to help my husband with our laundry when he overlooked the time.\nAll staff upon our departure\n-It was my birthday on our departure day, right before we left for the airport the staff came singing a birthday song with a birthday cake. I was extremely delighted. It was a great end to a fantastic stay in Avani. I really appreciate the team for preparing that. It was truly a memorable trip that we will forever cherish.",

              "text": "The Anantara Vacation Club Seminyak is an extraordinary place to stay.  Although it is in the busy Seminyak area, it doesn\u2019t feel that way, as it is tucked off the Main Street, walking distance to the restaurants and shopping but not in the middle of the noise and hassle and bustle.  The beach is a short walk away, although there is a shuttle there, there is really no reason to take it!  \nI have to mention that the staff at the Anantara Vacation Club are the best and go above and beyond to make you feel special. The service is second to none. The food is excellent, and it is brought ot your room.  You can also eat in the restaurant, but most people eat in their villas.  I had breakfast every morning in my villa and the staff that bring the breakfast are friendly, professional, and make you feel special.  Everyone at the resort  really are exceptional. \n\nThe Villas are very comfortable - I loved having my own pool, and used it morning and afternoon, and in the evening, I enjoyed having the small t.v. Room with the kitchenette to cool off before going to bed.  The bathrooms have an indoor and outdoor shower, and a very nice soaker bathtub that lets you look out into the private yard.  This felt like a luxury holiday and will definitely return.\nI appreciated the birds in the morning, and the breeze.  I highly recommend this resort.",

We stayed at a 1 bedroom unit which had its own private pool and living room which made our stay a very comfortable the one. \n\nDining experience was great. We had our daily breakfast and dinner at our own unit and it gave us a very homely feeling including a very high level of luxury and most importantly privacy. The team members in the hotel was very welcoming and has ensured all our needs were taken cared of from our arrival to departure. We highly recommend AVC Bali to all those who wish to travel to Bali soon and we have shared our amazing experience to our friends, colleagues and family. \n\nThank you to the entire team at AVC Bali, the driver, the guest service agents who handled our check in and check out, the team at the Sirai Restaurants, housekeeping, engineering and everyone else who ensured we had an amazing experience in Bali as well as with Anantara Vacation Club.

An Anantara vacation  always provides authentic quality accommodation in prime locations. Our 2 bedroom villa with private pool was spacious and very comfortable with beautiful natural stone bathrooms, pool views and spa body products: the beds were huge and comfortable with air conditioning as well as large glass sliding doors on to the pool. The bedroom villas are separated by a central kitchen villa tropical gardens and the swimming pool. Staff are unbelievably friendly and helpful at all times. The Balinese very high quality service whilst retaining their dignity which I enjoyed. It was a very lovely experience and we will be back. June offered the perfect climate in which to enjoy shopping, beach , swimming and stunning evenings.",

We had the cooked breakfast option but they do have a continental breakfast option as well. \n\n(Please note they do not offer a buffet breakfast option).\n\nThere is a bar but you need to sit in the restaurant or chairs near the pool to drink or take back to your room.\n\nThey have a large pool at the front of the complex which has several shade huts to lay down on and relax by the pool.\n\nThere is a front desk which is staffed 24/7 to allow you to drop your keys off or order a taxi or seek visitor information or organise day tours.\n\nThey offer a free shuttle service to their sister hotel which is located on the beach in Seminyak and you can stay and use their facilities for the day if you spend a minimum of $25 per person at that hotel. (I guess a lunch or dinner or maybe drinks).\n\nThe beach is approx 5-10 mins drive away.\n\nThere is an abundance of sports bars and restaurants and eateries available all within a short walk.\n\nThere are also brand name shops around and small supermarkets.\n\nDid not see many places to buy shirts or memorabilia etc like in Kuta where you need to barter.\n\nWe stayed in a 1 Bedroom Villa which accommodates 3 people - 1 king bed + Sofa Bed. You have access within your area of your own private plunge pool.\n\nYou do have a kitchenette with a microwave and medium size fridge should you wish to use.\n\nThe Villa is split into two areas with grass and plants between the rooms. The main room accommodates the main bedroom which has its own tv and DVD player with several wardrobes. You also have an ensuite which includes a deep bath, shower and toilet and outside shower.\n\nThe other area houses the kitchenette and a sofa (sofa bed) with another tv.\n\nBoth areas have ceiling fans and are air conditioned. \n\nThere is also another toilet and shower adjacent to the other area which I believe is more designed to when you use the pool and don\u2019t need to go through main bedroom to ensuite.\n\nYou have lay down chairs by the pool to relax.\n\nThere are no laundry in your villa however there is a guest laundry provided in the complex free of charge which has washing machines and dryers available for your use. \n\nYou also have a limited gym available to use in the complex with weights and balls and other items.\n\nThe complex also provides 2 bedroom villas for the small families which we saw staying here.\n\n",

From the moment we arrived to the day we departed, the staff here went above and beyond to make you feel comfortable and welcome. Probably the best staff I\u2019ve ever had in all our travels. The villas were gorgeous and had everything you needed. Our own private pool was fabulous!  We were close to the beach, restaurants and shopping. I also loved the restaurant. Their fresh food and drinks were great. It was easy to get a driver for the day through Anantara. The drivers were very knowledgeable and worked with you to come up with an itinerary for the day. I\u2019d like to also mention that one day my husband was not feeling well and we had to cancel dinner reservations that were made by reception. A short time later, wonderful chicken soup was delivered to our door. That type of service isn\u2019t seen much these days. We can\u2019t wait to go back next year!",

The pool villa is very well equipped, there a shower room next to the pool.  There is a separate TV room away from the villa itself with coffee machine and basic kitchen.  There is also a comfortable area outside for drinks or food.  It is not real close to the beach, but they run a free shuttle there and there are many great restaurants in the street the resort is on and also a main area 5 minutes walk away, with more restaurants, bars and a club.",

              "text": "We stayed 4 nights in a 1 bedroom pool villa at the Anantara VC Seminyak. \n\nLocation -\nInitially, we had slight reservations with it being a little far from the beach, but the location turned out to be great for shopping and dining! The main shopping street Jln Kayu Aya is only an easy 10 min walk away, and Jln Raya Seminyak is also 10 min away (using small alleys). There are good food options along Jln Drupadi itself (Kilo, Zibiru, Lacalaca to name a few), and myriad of restaurants/cafes are not far away. Funny how we ended up not going to the beach at all, as the in-villa pool and main pool satisfied the kids' water-play needs...\n\nResort/villa setting - \nEverything about its common area (reception, main pool, restaurant) fits what I have come to expect from Anantara: beautiful, well, kept, with their tasteful signature decor. This is a small resort, with only 18 villa-rooms, so it has a nice cosy feel to it, especially with the service personnel's warmth. The guest laundry area was clean and the machines were in good condition for use (bring your own detergent). The pool villa we stayed in was equally beautiful, and well equipped with everything we need. The in-villa pool was small-ish, but sufficient for kids to play in and a light swim for adults. \n\nService - \nService was top class, from check-in, housekeeping, dining, to check-out. I particularly applaud how the staff took only 1 day to identify my family (surname) and the room we stay in. Perhaps the small resort lend to this, but still, good service. All staff were friendly, and always greet people as they walk past. The staff at the restaurant provided good and warm service whenever we had breakfast. \n\nOverall, a very enjoyable stay is a fantastic resort. We liked this a lot, and will surely stay here again. \n\nHighly recommended.",

Very comfortable house with swimming pool, we have private dining room, our own laundry and kitchen in our place. It's very peaceful during day and night in the resort. But just 5 minutes walk to shopping street. There are hundred of restaurant and eat out over there with Asian and European style food, very cheap and not cause diarrhea.\n\nDuring my stay, Million Thanks to our guide Mr.Ketut Bayu brought us see Dolphin in North Bali even more than 2 hour drive alone (we were all sleepy). The spider-boat to see dolphin is great my 70-year-old aunty could join the trip without motion sickness and we found a lot of Dolphin there very close to them. Every trip was right on time and we have good picture from our guide.\n\nReally worth everyone time in Bali.",

The villa was gorgeous, and we really enjoyed the peace and quiet over a resort. Whenever we had questions about touring about Bali, or needed help calling cabs, or where to go to eat; the staff would research what they didn't know and recommend what they believed was the best. Meals at the Vacation Club were better than some of the restaurants we found around Seminyak. Between the two of us, we had a huge variety from the menu and it was all very delicious. We were very impressed with their pizza as it was better than something we'd find in America. During our trip, we bought a painting and needed to get it packaged in order to safety take it on the plane. When we weren't able to find a postal office to help us, the front desk took the painting and got a custom pvc pipe cut for the painting just a couple hours before we had to checkout. Overall, Anantara Vacation Club exceeded all expectations we had. 100% we will recommend this to everyone, and would return our next time in Bali.",

I organized most of our meals and a surprise dinner all through email and it was done to perfection! Our private room and pool were such a little piece of paradise just for us. We felt safe and near to so much. Taxis were arranged by the front desk and restaurant staff gave us recommendations on places to go and always asked how our daily trips were. You must experience a stay here while in Bali!! It will not disappoint. Thank you Anantara!!!",

              "text": "Quite simply, this property is a real letdown to the Anantara brand.  \n\nOverall ambience from lobby to pool to general grounds landscaping are at best comparable to the median, run of the mill 3* no brand property.  The so-called main pool is next to the lobby which is kinda bad resort design 101.  Location wasn't user friendly either - though it is within walking distance of Seminyak town it isn't all that close and there aren't really good shops or eateries nearby.\n\nWe stayed in a 2 bedroom pool villa, which didn't have a very user friendly layout.  The kitchenette, dining and living was housed in one small enclosure in the middle.  Somehow this made the whole place seem a lot more cramped than the sq ft would suggest as freedom of movement was restricted.  Bedrooms and toilets were reasonably spacious but not much decor and level of fittings were spartan.   \n\nThis is where I must say lies the real source of our disappointment.  I understand that Anantara bought over the property from a prior operator, so maybe not much can be done about structural stuff.  But c'mon guys please take more pride you HAVE to sweat the small stuff...the towels were rough, beds were hard and the kitchen did not even have a pair of scissors :)  To compound the already poor impression...WiFi was spotty, TV reception intermittent and daily amenities were not refilled (normally in a resort environment we would be more chilled out about these things but arrggh!).\n\nIn summary, the whole place just feels like dislocated as an Anantara property and we were frankly utterly shocked at the standards we experienced here.",

Facilities and restaurant options are limited in this small property.\n\nThe grand experience has gone lost in matters such as food offering, consistency of amenities available in the rooms, minimum number of towels available. Stains on linens, wear and tear if this fairly new property etc.\n\nNearest beach experience means going to Anantara Seminyak, where one can use the beach in front of the hotel where vendors frequently pass by trying to sell their merchandise.\nAlternatively a family beach outing would cost USD100 for a family of 4 which is the minimum spend in F&B to be consumed at the hotel to use their facilities.\n\n ",

We have gone with a smaller, more boutique style that offers a very high level of privacy & personalised service. Some owners prefer the bigger style of hotel that we offer in Phuket & Samui. The Bali property is really aimed at owners who want to get away from it all and enjoy real peace and quiet in the privacy of their villas.\r\n\r\nI was surprised that you raised concerns regarding the provision of amenities and linen. I was aware that you were not entirely satisfied with the scent of the body lotion and a new one was purchased immediately to replace the one in your villa. I was not aware of any other complaints.\r\n\r\nIf there were shortfalls in the amenities and linen, this should most definately not have been the case and I will look in to this with the team. My sincere apologies for any inconvenience caused.\r\n\r\nIt is true that AVC Bali is not on the beach front and as a result we have arranged it so that AVC guests may use the facilities of our sister hotel with minimum spend on food and beverage of USD 25 per person. Beach chairs can also be rented on the public beach for around USD 10 per day per person but this will not include the 5 star service available at the Anantara Seminyak.\r\n\r\nWe would love to have you come and stay with us again. Please feel free to contact me directly at jsweeneylowe@anantaraclub.com should I be able to assist you in any way in the future.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nJonathan",

I have since personally checked the hot water in all villas and it is working perfectly.\r\n\r\nI was surprised that you did not enjoy the resort location.

There are also many spas to choose from right next to the resort.\r\n\r\nIt is true that we are not a beach front property, however we do offer a shuttle service 3 times daily to the Anantara Seminyak, where Vacation Club guests can use the beach lawn & pool facilities with a minimum spend on food & beverage of USD 25 per adult. Alternatively, we can organise sun chairs on the public beach for USD 10 per day.\r\n\r\nIt is disappointing to read that you did not enjoy the breakfast. We believe that for USD 12 the offering is both sufficient and of good value. Furthermore, regarding activities, we have an extensive selection for both children and adults.

              "text": "I chose this resort because of atrractive package cost offered by bank promotion, compare to Anantara group hotels, this resort may be not in line with it, but still is an amazing and good place to stay.  Honestly, if they charge me market rate, this may not be my choice, but considering the promotion price, this is worthy.\n\nI just want to say something good about this resort, since I read many negative comments from trip advisor, but my experience is:\n\n1) private pool is definitely clean, there are some flower seeds or leafs on it, but this is definitely normal and acceptable, I saw how the housekeeping clean it on the 2nd day, they brush the pool and clear up all the floating leafs every day, so I was so enjoying the private pool during my stay.\n\n2) toilet is clean, not smelly, enough hot water, I spent half hour to take shower and shampoo, still have hot water supply.\n\n3) mosquito problem, I think this happens in Bali, not just Anantara. Nevertheless, I appreciate what Anantara has done to eliminate this, they have a memo tip in room to remind you how to stay away from mosquitoes, they provide mosquitoes spray in both bedroom and living room, also they regulary spray insects repeller inside hotel.  I think Anantara is really considering guest experience so they do a lot to tackle this problem.\n\n4) staff service is excellent, very helper, nice and polite, reponse quickly.\n\n5) even the last room you stay, it's not really far awy from the lobby, since the scale of the resort is relatively smaller than chain resort and those I travelled before (some resorts may need to drive a golf car to the lobby), so it is not necessary to request any room near lobby.\n\nLastly, I didn't purchase their package after listening their 90 mins preview, in fact, I spent 2.5 hours to it, cos I do interested in it and seems appealing to me, their salesperson was still nice even I declined it.",

              "text": "This was our 3rd Bali visit. We planned this visit after  we got this invitation from Anantara Vacation Club to experience and enroll. We were in a 2 beedroom Villa. \n\nThis place is in a remote part of Seminyak, far away from the beach and  about a 10 m walk to the Seminyak  market with loads of food options. Suited us fine, staying in SEA we have a little too much of beaches anyway. This place is close to Ke de ta, Rock Bar, Potato Head so the night life is taken care of...One thing that irked me was the road that led to the market, it was dimly lit and we saw a snatching right in front of us so we were super careful. \n\nAbout the Villa itself\u2026 we can find no major faults\u2026 yes the bedrooms are not connected and that\u2019s the charm of it\u2026. The glass living area in the middle was beautiful...The pool is lovely, people have complained that they were dirty but no its just the leaves that fall in the night. You can call the staff and promptly someone comes and cleans it. They have only one restaurant \u2013 not the best food but  passable, but there are plenty of choices at a 20-30 m walk. The rooms/ d\u00e9cor / amenities are fantastic!!! But we have stayed in Anantara resorts before... this though is lovely, don't expect similar amenities... These villas were fantastic but unlike the other anantara do not have the sea view or the rated restaurants... but they also don't charge you the other one's rates.\n\nThere are a few key drawbacks\u2026 First in the Villa the sunken tub is a hazard especially for families with kids\u2026 we told our toddler that it\u2019s a dry pool and she didn\u2019t go anywhere near it. Second is that this place is dimly lit so in the evenings if your villa is at the end then walking on the cobbled path is not too nice. Ours was the first villa so we didn\u2019t have any issues. Finally the entrance is a narrow pathway, for one car only, so if you are driving it\u2019s a major irritant.\nNow if one is wondering if we bought the package- the answer is no\u2026 but we were really tempted. If they pushed us enough we would have bought it\u2026 but we did the math and it didn\u2019t really add up so we resisted the temptation. \nWe have stayed later at a different Anantara resort and again tempted to most likely signup next year---- Lets see",

And were quite impressed with the exterior of our villa when we stepped in, as this is our first villa experience.\n\nYet, after we settled down in our room, we discovered:\n(1) small tiny bugs jumping on our bed; \n(2) the toilet ware and bath tub a bit worn off and doesnt look very clean\n(3) the toilet bowl a bit smelly\n(4) our private pool seems to be covered with dust and dead bugs which was not very appealing for us to get in and swim\n(5) At night, we found the room a bit dark even we switched on the light\n(6) the biggest problem is the bug mosquitos almost everywhere in our room and bathroom, even we didnt open our door at all throughout the day; we were being waken by the mosquitos at night and my eye lid got swollen after the second night, with my arms and legs got bitten\n\nAt first we planned to spend most of our time to enjoy the villa, turned out we stayed most of the time outside our villa to avoid the bugs.\n\nWe are reqired to join a 90 min presentation in the morning about their super expensive vacation club membership. I am amused that they compared themselves with Bayan Tree's USD 150K club membership. Anyway, we expected that and were quite firmed with our decision prior to that, so the experience not as bad as I thought.\n\nAll in all, it is a good deal for our stay given the low promotion rates for the AVC membership trial.

We are very lucky to have such a great team and are constantly reviewing our services and facilities to ensure we are providing our guests with the very best.\r\n\r\nI noticed that you experienced some difficulties with the bugs and mosquitos during your stay. As there is a strong presence in Bali';s tropical climate, we do employ the services of an outside contractor to conduct daily fogging & spraying to limit guest exposure. We also provide mosquito coils and repellent in the villa which can also be very effective. On occasion they can find their way to the pool but you need only let the Front Desk know and the problem can easily be addressed.\r\n\r\nI do apologise if the condition of the toilet & bath did not meet with your expectations. We have already been in to your villa and conducted a deep clean to ensure everything is spotless for your next visit.\r\n\r\nThank you for once again for your comments. Please feel free to contact me directly should I be able to offer any further assistance.\r\n\r\nKind Regards\r\n\r\nJonathan Sweeney-Lowe\r\nDirector of Resort Operations",

              "text": "My husband and I stayed in the Private Pool Villa, here's our experience:\n\nVilla Experiences: \n1) We had to changed to another villa on our second day, which was very inconvenience considering we unpacked everything.  Why did we changed to another villa?  Here are the reasons:\na) There was no lights in the bathroom and shower\nb) There were no shampoo in the shower\nc) At 7am the next morning there were construction worker banging on the roof and woke us up\nd) Well to be in a Private Pool Villa, you would at expect privacy right?  Whoops!  I had 3 construction men watching me going to the toilet, shower and basically I was EXPOSED to the 3 men.\n\n2) After I complained, they changed room for us.  Which we thought was 'much better'... but it didn't end there... after the 'better villa', the following issues still exists:\na) The shower and toilet was actually disgustingly old and dirty\nb) Hot water only runs 20 mins, if you want to take a bath in the bath tub, good luck, as it didn't work for us... took 20 mins for the tub to be half full... then had to wait another 20 or so minute for hot water to 'return' but of cos by then the original half tub was cold already!\nc) The pool is dirty and super small, put it clearly, we did not even step out feet inside that dirty pool!\n\nServices:\na) Well the services was of cos not up to any other 'resort' standard.  For breakfast, there were only one waiter, meaning wait wait wait and wait...\nb) To think they would have a Spa in this Villa, well, sorry there's none.  But to our surprise, NO ONE had given us the Anantara Spa Menu (which is 3 mins by car) at their other resort, but rather gave us some doggy local salon/spa.  We ended up exploring other spa outside ourselves.\nc) Well, they asked us for our flight schedule prior to our stay.  I booked around 4.5 months in advanced, but a very simple request of 'late check-out' just to match our flight schedule could NOT be entertained!?! What a joke!  We are not asking alot, just check-out at 1pm could not be entertained.\n\nADDITIONAL \"UNEXPECTED\" EXPERIENCE:\na) We came across this resort due to some promotion.  We had to listen to their vacation club membership programme for 90 mins.  My husband and I was in fact interested in it and asked many questions, which the 90 mins became 2.5 hrs.  Well, the membership they initially tried to sell us was just under USD100,000 (by installment), then the sales manager came and tried to closed the selling with a membership of under USD60,000.  To be very honest, my husband and I was seriously considering.  All we asked was for us to go back to our room and discuss tonight and give them the decision the next day.  (Considering we are staying at the resort, we can't go anywhere right?)   Well... typical 'closed door' sales... immediately when we say we need to consider and get back to them... they literally changed their attitude to \"BLACK FACE\" and closed their file ready to send us off?!?!?! What type of sales is that?  I mean we are talking about a ready buyer who actually just want one night to consider which option is better and we weren't allowed to? \nb) So what happened next?  They had a 'service-check gal' come into the room after the two 'disappointment sales left the room'.  She seems abit better and said we can try out their system with only around USD2000 trial fee, my husband and I thought it was very reasonable and said we will seriously consider, but we still want to confirm her the day after.  What was the answer?  No again! \nc) In conclusion, honestly, my husband and I was seriously consider buying the membership if only they weren't so hard sell and forced one-time closed.  If they let us consider, I actually am quite confident we would take up the offer as we travel lots anyway and it seems like a reasonable membership scheme.\n\nSo what happened next?\n- We were informed immediately after the 'sales presentation' by the reception that our \"ONE HR\" initially agreed late check-out was rejected. \n\nThis seriously was the WORST EVER EXPERIENCE I had ever had with a holiday.  \nI never really write much reviews or comments, but this experience I feel like I must share with the public and do the society some good by warning you all 'what you will expect'.",

The pool water was greenish and lots of leaves and branches in it. Then our air-con was not cold. When the engineering tool out the filters,  they were black...full of dusts. Then the TV reception was poor and we have to change room after nearly 1 hour trouble shooting in the room.\n\nThe villa layout is the worst. The bedroom is in 1 room and you have  another room for the sitting and kitchen. The 2 rooms are located at one end to another. It is so inconvenient. When we order room service, we have to walk and dine in  the kitchen/living room. It is truly a bad design. \n\nBreakfast only comes in a set. You have to pay for additional cup of coffee or juice. Food was terrible. However, our room service dinner and lunch were pretty good and thats the only consolation. Apart from that, this hotel has nothing to offer. Dont waste your time. ",

However, we found their service is great and the free shuttle is just 3 min away from the linked Anantara Seminyak hotel. The villa is spacious and the pool temperature is good for small kids.  We tried the in villa BBQ too, it was great experience. The people working there are all very helpful.\n\nSome suggestions here: should have kids club like other resorts and free shuttle from the main shopping street back to resort.",

We previously stayed in AVC Phuket and the Anantara Resort and Spa Seminyak.\n\nWhile AVC Seminyak is just like the rest there is room for improvement to make it a truly 5 star resort.\n\nWe stayed in Suite 15 and found that the pool was dirty when we arrived. None of the 3 airconds were working properly and probably had not been serviced for sometime. We had to inform the front desk about the airconds and to be fair this was rectified promptly. \n\nWhen ordering dinner at night do be prepared to wait for your meals. The staff are really trying their best but they are quite thin on the ground.\n\nOn the plus side the staff are friendly and do try their very best. Meals are up to scratch although we ate quite a bit in the Resort which is a short taxi ride away.\n\nOn the whole AVC Bali is definitely not as good as Phuket.\n\n",

Cab about 5 min ride about 20,000 rupiah. Would definitely return. Thanks to Jonathan and entire staff for a great stay!",

The welcome drinks is cold, ginger tasty, and a little bitter sweet, my favorite. They have the library, different with others, they prepared some toys for kids. My daughters were vetted indulged by the toys, even my 10 month daughter. I can also bring them to my rooms. I booked two bedroom pool villa, my husband, brother and my little daughters had spent whole afternoon in the dinning room. , it is bright, cozy and warm, just like home. My 4years old daughter like the swimming pool outside the dinning room. Jonathan Sweeney Lowe, the GM of the club is very helpful when I have special request. I would say, it is the best hotel I experienced in Bali with my family.",

No cleansing for long time! I would rather to swim at the large public pool - then what's the point to have a private pool\n\nThe location is far away from the beach and shop, and in fact the entrance is extremely small and most taxi drivers have never heard of this property and easy to miss.\n\nHowever the service quality is pretty high and very responsive.  The in house restuarant is another plus to this property, I have tried almost everything on the menu and the taste is well above Bali average.\n\nI realize Anantara Vacation Club properties are sub-standard product - at least for this and Phuket one.  I have visited another Anantara at Seminyak which is 5 minutes drive away and seems that one is a better option as it is along the beach front - and I dont mind it is not villa type.",

In pamphlets, visitors were encouraged to click pictures when they spotted a gecko to win a gecko soft toy. Brilliant trick but still didn't go down well with us! \n\nTaxi was must as place is far from market & beach.\n\nAverage experience as Bali seems to have better alternatives with significantly better value.",

The rooms were extremely comfortable and spacious. The villa was spotless. The outdoor shower, sunken bath, private plunge pool and amenities made us feel very pampered. I loved how we could either keep the doors closed and chill to the AC or open the living room/dining/kitchen sliding doors and jump directly into the pool from there. Service was prompt and food requests came within 15-20mins of calling. The only downside was that the location itself was not too great. Far from the beach (although there is a shuttle available to take you to the other Anantara property. Ideal would have been if the two were connected) and not near many of the shops and restaurants that made inland Bali properties worth it. That said, staff was always ready to call you a cab, or shuttle, or even the resort golf cart if you were too lazy to walk from the dining area to your villa.",

My friend and I absolutely loved waking up in the morning and starting our day with a refreshing swim among the frangipani trees and room service with a smile if we desired. \n\nThe staff here are amazing, always answering our calls promptly from the room and offering their services for any bookings or housekeeping needs. Our rooms were always refreshed with clean towels and amenities including bottled water, tea and coffee. \n\nWe were more than satisfied with our stay at anantara vacation club and would happily stay here again.

              "text": "I couldn't agree more with the most recent review given on this property.  It isn't suitable for a family with young children. We travelled in 5 pax and this includes one toddler and an infant .  We stayed in a one-bedroom pool villa.\nThe biggest downside to this property is the separation of the living room / kitchen from the bedroom.  When it rains ( 5 straight rain- pouring days out of our 6-day stay) having to travel between the 2 rooms is extremely annoying.  Constantly opening and closing doors not only meant inconvenience, also risked mosquitoes invasion, frog or lizard coming to the room .\nThe second foremost downside is the kitchen.  Poor design, limited bench space, can't even fit a plate on the benchtop. There's also no dining sets or a designated place for dining. There's one small table and chair so each person has to take turns eating.  The other downsides are the deep sunken bath (dangerous for kids), one washing machine to be shared by 18 families (when full house), poor functioning air conditioner, and poor location.  You can walk for around 15-20 min to reach some real shops but the walk is unpleasant. The road is narrow so cars or motorcycles will splash water on you from the puddles.\nThe only upside to this place is the service, it is a 6 star service.  Despite being fully booked, the service is extremely prompt and accommodating. We made quite a lot of requests from housekeeping, each time our requests were received with smiles and patience, and items were delivered within 5 minutes .Staff members were extremely friendly n helpful.\nOur stay has been unpleasant due to the extreme poor weather and disappointment with the room itself, but the excellent service and helpful staffs made our day everyday.\nThe rating of Poor is given based on the price of this accommodation vs what it has to offer. Disregarding the price, it would deserve an Average rating.",

              "text": "Stayed for a week with 7 pax with a mix family profile of grandparents, a toddler, an infant.\n\nStayed in a 2-bedroom villa near to the entrance/deli. Was initially worried about possible noise from outside, but it was very private. It is also near the gym and laundry area (villa 5). It is also near the main pool which has a children shallow pool area. This is good for us as the pool villa does not have area suitable for young children. \n\nVilla design is not suitable for families with young children. There are three main buildings/wings separated by outdoor space. Two bedrooms are to the east and west of the kitchen/living room. So, when it is raining heavily, we will have to carry an umbrella when we commute between rooms or we will be struggling to juggle carrying several items (eg an active infant and milk bottles) while opening and closing doors. It was also dangerous to leave our children (infant & toddler) sleeping in the bedroom alone and rest/watch TV in the kitchen as it is too far away to hear any cries. The toliet is also dangerous for young children as it has a deep sunken bathtub where they can walked into it easily. The design is more suited for couples rather than families with young children. \n\nWas also disappointed to find out that it had a common laundry area with only one washing machine and two dryers. Spent half a day doing laundry for 7 pax. It didn't help that there was a power trip and we had to restart the cycle. So do bring sufficient clothes. Was probably spoilt by other anantara vacation club facilities in Thailand where there is in-villa 2 in 1 washing machines and we could just throw our laundry into the machine and travel out. \n\nService was excellent. All staff were very professional and  friendly. They were also very prompt in repairs when given feedback. I also enjoyed the refreshing cold water served when we go to the common pool.\n\nFor service. I only have issues with the quota of two 1.5L drinking water bottles per villa, which is very challenging for 7 people (including two milk drinking children). On good days, I could get 3 bottles after 'begging' for more. Anyway, we had to buy much more on our own. I just felt that they could ration the water according to the number of people living in a villa, rather than just standard 2 bottles per villa.\n\nDeli food was tasty and nice. It is reasonably priced at around 100k to 150k for each main. For cheaper options, you can just take a short walk just outside (restaurant selling pizza, pasta and local food). There is also a mini mart just outside.\n\nThere are 3 shuttle timings to go to the beach club starting at 10am which is very hot at the beach. We called a cab to go there earlier in the morning for around 25k. It was cheap and recommended if you want to avoid the afternoon sun. Beach club for AVC is a good 5-10 min walk from drop off point and only comprise of 4 beach seats and an outdoor shower. We decided it was not worth the walk there but rather pay for the facilities nearer to the drop off point. \n\nGenerally, feel that AVC in seminyak is more suitable for couples instead of young or large families.",
