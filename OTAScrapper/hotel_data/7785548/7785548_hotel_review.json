The location is great- 4 mins walk to restaurants, bars and cafes galore. 5 mins walk to the beach, and more beach bars or water sports. The villa itself is beautiful- lovely big private pool with cute water fountains. Comfy living space with equipped kitchen. Bedroom is air conditioned and bathroom has fantastic shower and free standing tub! Everything was clean and spotless, with nice touches like dressing gowns, amenities and free drinking water. But best of all was the service- friendly, informative, the team really couldn't do enough. They even arranged late check out for us. We would go back in a second- thankyou for a perfect start aradhana! Only suggestion would be to invest in a Bluetooth enabled music device for guests :)",

I did a lot of research of Canggu villas and decided this was the pick and I was correct. Everything is perfect even the pathway down to the villa is spectacular. The villa itself is extremely private with beautiful pool and gardens with lots of little birds visiting the pool and frangipani flowers. The staff are all very sweet and helpful. We ordered Indonesian breakfast each day which was delicious. The villa has two large double rooms each with a spacious bathroom which is opulent but fitting into the tropical environment. Would suit family of 4 or 2 couples. Beds are comfortable and fresh towels and sheets supplied each day. Complementary drinks were stocked in the fridge and we still haven\u2019t drank them all. There is nothing we could complain about and it has been money well spent as it was just what our family needed. The staff were always happy and smiling which is a sign that they are working in good conditions so also happy to support that. It is our last day today and it will be sad to leave and wished we had booked a longer stay. It\u2019s a gorgeous place.",

              "text": "The villa was truly lovely, the pool was just so great to have.  The daily cleaning was thorough and thoughtful.  The food however was terrible  and they got simple orders wrong, the massage (included with our package but priced at $60.. was poor, considering you can get a great massage in many places for $10).  The free wifi wouldnt work after day one and after advising staff 3 times of this problem we got no response nor attempts to remedy it.  Fortunately my daughter had access to data on her plan otherwise we would have not been able to do any planning or staying in touch with family.    They didnt replenish the 2 instant coffee satchets that were there on the first day, nor provide milk, so without going out to buy, or requesting and paying for it, no coffee available.  When i compare to what we paid elsewhere, this definitely was NOT worth 200+ per night.   Also the only way to get out of the pool was on the side of the bathroom/bedroom with SUPER slippery tiles, so you couldnt get out of the pool straight into the outdoor living area, where fridge, and chairs were, so you had to drip through the bedroom every time you wanted to hop out for a drink or something.   Definitely wouldnt stay there again.   Find somewhere cheaper with the same facilities and hopefully better food/service",

              "text": "I had a much longer review, but courtesy to trip advisor I lost a lot of the content and am just gonna have to some up some points here.\n\nThe villa was okay, not a sunny pool villa like we hoped it would be but nice all the same. I would recommend putting some form of a concrete strip that goes from the pool to the downstairs bathroom though, the tiles are very slippery when wet and there are times where you need to go to the toilet shortly after or during a swim and times is not in your favour. Sadly in our case, Mum slipped as a result and hurt her leg and back.\n\nThe staff were amazing, if you had a request they did their best to accommodate and were always very friendly and welcoming.\n\nThe food was up and down. Sometimes it was really good, other times not so much. Most of our personal issues were either inconsistency or mistranslation. For example, we ordered the Snapper Herbs Crumbles a few times, the first time it was amazing, the second time the fish was dry and the third time the potatoes were missing. We also tried to request a runny egg on our Nasi Goreng. We tried fried egg, sunny side up egg and then finally poached egg; the first was scrambled, the second was sliced omelette, and finally the third one worked out. Our least favourite dish was the Gado Gado, we had tried a street cart one before ordering from the villa and the difference was amazing. The villa one looked nice but tasted terrible, the street cart one was not too pretty but tasted amazing.\n\nFor the afternoon tea, we pretty much enjoyed most on offer, aside from the toasted bread pieces with the raw ingredients on it.\n\nThe drinks are mostly a pass, aside from Watermelon and Papaya, most of the others tasted like they were watered down quite a lot, especially the Pineapple and Strawberry. The apple juice was our least favourite. As for cocktails, we enjoyed the Tequila Sunrise the most but we often found better and cheaper cocktails 5 minutes down the road.\n\nThe shuttle service was okay, but it would be nice if they could be a little more flexible with shorter distance drop offs. It just feels odd booking what would otherwise be an in the moment decision to head down to the local shops.\n\nThe massages we had at the villa were nice, but very expensive, so we often went down the road for some instead and the quality was just as good.\n\nMy only real hard complaint aside from the villa tiles would be the distance to our villa. We were in villa 7, almost right at the very end of the path. My mum and I have MS, and my grandmother was with us as well (she has quite weak ankles due to breaks). I though when we first arrived that night that the reason we were so far down was because it was to cater to our request for a sunny pool villa, but sadly this wasn't the case (at least from our perspective as 2 hours of sun in the day that only covers half of the pool is far from what we were expecting). It's a long distance, and while I myself was fine still being quite young and able, mum and my grandmother were always finding themselves quite tired going up the elevated path each day.\n\nAll in all though, we still managed to have a nice holiday here!",

The food was amazing and the barbecue we had on our final night was perfect, cooked by the staff in our garden area and candle lanterns provided for a lovely setting.

The Rendang was very mild and Nasi Goreng was lacking flavour and the Satay was a bit dry.\n\nThis could however be just down to our own personal taste!\n\nThe staff were wonderful and nothing was too much trouble for them\n\n",

The staff are all amazing and friendly, call you by name from day 1 and are extremely helpful without being obtrusive at all.. I can\u2019t rave about them enough. \nThe villas themselves are absolutely amazing, you sacrifice the rice paddy view for absolute privacy and it is so worth it. We didn\u2019t hear another guest in our entire time there. The staff always call before food delivery or any service just to make sure it is ok with you. The villa is stunning, pool is clean and always refreshing and the maintenance men who come around each night to clear the bugs and do citronella candles do a great job. \nThe food is all incredible and the breakfast menu has something for everyone, the juices are great! \nThe drop off service is super great but be sure you don\u2019t get ripped off in a taxi on the way back. Shouldn\u2019t cost more than 50,000 in a metered taxi. Always use bluebird. \n\nCan\u2019t recommend this place enough, can\u2019t wait to come back. Thanks to all the staff for making our honeymoon unforgettable.",

I loved the outdoor bath and living areas. The pool is a good size and we spent quite a lot of time either in the pool or on the comfortable sun lounges. \nWe can also recommend the massages!\nThe room service was very reasonably priced and the Indonesian food was delicious. The western food was also done pretty well. The villa was kept spotless by the staff and the staff did a daily mosquito treatment throughout the villa to keep them at bay. \nThere isn\u2019t really any reason to leave the villa if you don\u2019t want to, but Canggu was a great town to explore. Much quieter than Seminyak but still lots of great places to eat and shop. We didn\u2019t get to half the places we wanted to during our week long stay! We used the drop off service a few times with and found it really useful and easy. \nWifi is decent but a little patchy at times.\nThankyou Aradhana Villas for the much needed R and R!",

Our Scoopon purchase included two-bedroom villa for four guests (even though we were a party of three), daily breakfast, high tea, lunch or dinner, 2 massages per guest, airport transfers and free drop off in Canngu or Seminyak. From the moment, we were picked up from the airport to being returned to say goodbye we felt we were treated like royalty. Every need or request from ordering and delivery of meals, advising of local amenities and restaurants plus transports was met with an attentive response and smiling face. Particular members of staff and the operations manager Ariani went out of their way to ensure everything was perfect to create a memorable relaxing stay. I cannot thank the staff at Aradhana Villa\u2019s enough for their hospitality during our stay the memories created will last a life time!",

Aradhana is a great little resort with fantastic facilities and really nice, helpful staff.  We stayed in a 2 bedroom villa with 5 of us in total.  The villa was very luxurious and is just as it appears in their promotional photos.  Our packages included a couple of meals per day and they were the only slightly disappointing aspect.  Most of the food was actually pretty good, but on our first day we were served ribs and potato chips and both were stone cold.  We also ordered 3 scoops of sorbet and they were served it as a liquid!  We assumed it had completely melted prior to being served.  We never complained about either of these things and they probably would have fixed them if we had done so - just thought it was worth a mention.  The only thing we did complain about was that on one day, all the glasses that the drinks and milk came in with very dirty, with brown muck on the inside of the glasses.  We spoke to the manager who apologised and told us it wouldn't happen again - which it didn't.    Overall we had a very relaxing stay at Aradhana and would recommend it to anyone travelling to Bail who wants to stay in a nice resort away from the crowds.",

From the lovely bunch of flowers placed on our bed, to the crystal clear pool; this little villa was a great place to escape to after the craziness of spending a few nights in downtown Bali.\nThe pick up was arranged without any dramas, and the check in was easy. My husband and I enjoyed our breakfasts each morning (perhaps the coffee could have been hotter, but this is a minor issue) and we decided to eat in one evening. We were not disappointed.\nThe little shop across the road has a lovely young woman working there, she was a delight to talk to, and Berawa beach was just down the road and Canggu was an easy walk as well. The staff were incredibly friendly and I really enjoyed my time at Aradhana Villas. Thank you!",

Aura, Arik, Pak Sugita etc were amazing! \n\nThe villa and pool area are so much more beautiful than the photos suggest. The garden is immaculate; flowering plants are all around the pool - just beautiful! Size of their pool was perfect for swim and chillax while holding your cocktails! We had massage at their pool area and enjoying most of our time in the villa - enjoying breakfast, afternoon tea, dinner / lunch, sunset time because we just dont want to leave this beautiful villa!\n\nThe villa is very spacious and the kitchen / living room is well equipped and clean. I imagine that this is a brilliant choice for families or couples! \n\nWe stayed at their 2 bedroom villa and both room was large, with a vaulted traditional roof structure inside. The air con and wifi are 100%. \n\nYou surrounded by great restaurants and close to Brawa Beach. Finns Beach Club, Oldmans etc are within walking distance\n\nFor the price, particularly, this is such a great choice.\n\nWe will come back. Thank you Karaniya Experience!",

Arriving at the airport we were greeted by the amazing Sugita, who became a friendly, familiar face throughout our visit. All the staff we dealt with were polite, professional and always smiling. The villa itself was great, we particularly enjoyed the outdoor bathroom, even using the bath a couple of times despite the warm weather. The outdoor living space was also very pleasant. Breakfast each morning was delicious, particularly the Nasi Goreng :) \n\nThe area the villa is in is perfect really. We hired a scooter from the convenience store across the road (Great little shop with lovely owners), which made accessing the many local cafes very easy. You could also walk about 1km to a nearby street filled with top shelf cafes such as Nude, Milk & Madu, and a nice bakery which I can't recall the name of. \n\nHighly recommend Aradhana and will be back as soon as possible. \n\n",

In truth we didn't need to leave for anything but when we did we found the beach just down the road which stretches all the way to the Seminyak/Legian area. So we walked often to restaurants this way. Local cafes are close by as well. The staff are very very helpful and very kind and the villa itself is a Balinese oasis. Outdoor / undercover kitchen and the bathrooms have a beautiful way of bringing indoor and outdoor together. We had one small but persistent problem with the toilets blocking up but the staff were on to it straight away. The food was lovely if not a bit limited so venturing out to the nearby amazing cafes and restaurants was the way to go. Highly recommended way to spend a week or 2 if you value peace and privacy.",

The staff were so friendly and happy to help with anything.\nWalking down the beautiful path to our very private villa we felt like we were in paradise.\nThe setting is beautiful and the room is very comfortable.  There is a seperate outdoor kitchen and sitting area connected by a path to the bedrrom and semi-outdoor bathrrom. The room was very clean and anything we needed was only a call away.  \nIt is located in a quiet area of Canggu and only a five minute walk to Berawa beach.  There are some great little cafes in the town and very close to Seminyak if you want to do some shopping.\nWe loved everything about Aradhana Villas and would definately stay again!",

              "text": "I can only concur with many of the other glowing comments about Aradhana. It is very private, quiet and in a sense isolated. In our week at the villas we only saw two other couples at reception where you could give a smile or g'day. This is the perfect anti stress location and obviously is not for everyone and perhaps not something you'd want to do all the time.\nThe villa is spacious, the outdoor bathrooms unique and a pleasant outdoor seating area, dining, kitchenette etc. It can get warm there and we did retreat often into the aircon bedroom. The pool is superb! Mossies are a bit of an issue altho not thru any fault of the measures the staff try to put in place. If mossie bites affect you badly well maybe it could be an issue.\nThe housekeeping staff were fantastic with great attention to detail, very organised and accomodating. The food we had in house, as all is room serviced was very nice. Coffee was often cool but nothing that couldn't be fixed by a boil of the kettle.\nI would suggest the need for extra shelves in the cupboards as there is hanging space but limited other storage which meant living out of the case which is not ideal over a week.\nOverall we had a wonderful stay and are much refreshed.",

We were picked up at the airport by a lovely staff member which was much nicer than negotiating with the hundreds of taxi drivers! The villas were lovely and each came with a private pool. We were two families so had villas next door to each other, the staff were happy to bring our meals to one villa and there was plenty of room in the outdoor area.\nOne of our party is anaphylactic to peanuts and cashews and the staff were great with ensuring there were no traces of nuts in any of our food. \nThe area is very quiet and if you want proximity to lots of shopping and nightlife this is prob not for you but for a relaxing family holiday it was great.\nStaff were happy to drive us into Canggu or Seminyak and we just caught taxis back.\nWifi was fast which kept the teens happy!",

These villas are the ultimate in relaxation, tucked away, far from the hustle and bustle.  The villa had everything we could need and the staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing was a problem.   We spent two days just chilling in our private pool, with regular deliveries of ice for our drinks :-)  The facilities are first class, from the super comfy bed to the experience of the outdoor shower/bathroom.  We even indulged in a fully body massage by our private pool.  I would totally recommend Aradhana Villas to anyone who wants a quiet break to relax and do very little.",

The air con in the bedroom is very powerful and gives you deprive from the hot Canggu air. The staff here are seriously switched on and make you feel so welcome with solid advice, tips and a good sense of humour. That make your room look every day by making your bed, put away stray clothes and putting mosquito coils out at night to avoid nasty bites. Breakfast is solid with enough to feed even the bigger eaters it there. The location is a quite part of Canggu only a short distance from the incredible Nude cafe. There is also a cross fit box around the corner which was handy for me. Strongly recommend staying here.",

              "text": "We have just returned from an excellent week at Aradhana Villas, feeling refreshed, revived, spoilt and a little bit fatter than when we arrived!\n\nFrom the moment we arrived we were looked after with friendly greeting at the airport, smooth check in. \n\nWe stayed in villa 6, very spacious, immaculate, peaceful and beautiful! The private pool is MASSIVE! Wonderfully not overlooked and felt very private.\n\nWe had booked using a scoopon voucher and was worried we might be treated as second class citizens as sometimes happens but this was absolutely not an issue and the staff were warm and clear regarding our inclusions.\n\nWe ate often from the menu, breakfasts were excellent! The lunch/dinner was ok, well presented and tasty. We would love to see more local dishes available but I understand you are catering to western tastes. Afternoon tea was a cute addition but we didn't rush to order as we were eating ALOT!\n\nWe bought duty free bottles to enjoy poolside, the staff were more than happy to provide plenty of ice and limes. We also grabbed mixers and beers from the local shop just across the road. The cocktails offered were very yummy too!\n\nLots of people have commented on the location, to me it was PERFECT! Plenty of great eating / drinking spots within a 10 min walk or the super drivers would drop you off in Canggu / Seminak. We opted to stay local most of the time and enjoyed walking home in the cooler evening air. Actually didn't have a bad meal in a week!!\n\nIt's a super safe area. Quite so if your a big party person this might not be the right area, but if you are after peace and quite with lots of delicious places on your doorstop then this is it!!!!\n\nA few small points for the managers.\n\nYour staff are amazing!!! \nThank you for late checkout!!!\n\nWe were often referred to by our middle names rather than first or family, we found it very funny and didn't mind but perhaps a quick guideline on the formality of European names.\n\nWe arrived after 10pm when the kitchen was closed as was all the local places. A really great added extra you could offer would be a cold snack waiting for late guests arrival - club sandwich or something like that would be perfect!\n\nThe above are so minor! Was excellent!!  Thank you again, we can't wait to come back.",

The location is very quiet and peaceful and the staff are friendly, welcoming and the service, housekeeping  and meals were always of a high standard.\n\nThe only downside to being in a very quiet and safe location was that it is a little out of the way, meaning organising transport each day was essential.\n\nUnfortunately the Hindu New Year celebrations fell during our stay and this did have an impact on our ability to get back to the Villas in the afternoons ( 4 hours to get from Seminyak!) Had we been advised when we booked tthat our last 3 days would fall during these celebrations - we would have chosen a different week.\n\nOverall a wonderful first trip to Bali.",

              "text": "These quaint villas are located in Canngu. Canngu offers modern facilities in a traditional Balinese environment. It is close to the beach which is ideal for those whishing to surf and only a short drive for shopping in Seminyak. The Villas are situated in a quiet street surrounded by rice fields and only a 400 mt. walk to the beach. The Villas are very comfortable and have everything you will need to make your stay a pleasant one. Our villa had its own pool, outdoor living and dinning area fitted with TV,DVD lounge seating, dinning table and cooking facilities including cook top,pots and pans. We chose not to cook but ordered meals from the kitchen. All meals are cooked fresh and served in your villa. All meals were delicious including breakfast everyday. Lots to choose from! The enclosed airconditioned sleeping area was large with a very comfortable king sized bed,TV iPod dock,safe deposit and small writing desk with phone. Through the bedroom is an outdoor bathroom with bath,basin and shower facilities. All is very private. What really stands out with these Villas are the staff. All the staff are friendly and and go above and beyond to make your stay a pleasant and memorable one. We will stay here again.",

We rounded off on the villas in the basis of trip advisor reviews and we were not disappointed at all. \nBeautiful quaint villas situated at about 400m from a not so known Berawa beach in the Canggu area of Bali. \nTalking of the villas there's nothing you can find fault in. They give you enough privacy and luxury you will want. The semi outdoor bathroom is  great, the shower head amazing. Only that expect a few tarantulas walking up your soap case, just be aware especially after a rainfall as the villas have a lot of garden area and the insects come out in the evening and after a rainfall. \nThe semi open kitchenette is very convenient, really helped us vegetarians in a country which barely had concept of non meat meals. \nThe pool is great and it's very refreshing to have an early morning and late night dive. We completely loved it. \nThe bedroom opened directly into the pool which we didn't really use. Could have been a little larger and the closet area a little more spacious, I had to put some effort in figuring out some space to put my stuff. The study area had practically no light, but who would like to read on a vacation (I guess some people would). \nYou can have better bath robes guys !!!\nOn the whole the villas are great and offer amazing privacy. We couldn't hear rest sight any guest, when they told us they had almost half of the villas occupied. \nAll in all a great stay of three days. Would recommend Aradhana only that the location is a little distant. But you will love it. ",

Ariani and her staff are so welcoming and warm and nothing was too much trouble. The Villas are stunning, beautifully appointed, quiet, totally luxurious and private. Having a private pool was amazing! The location is in a quiet part of Canggu but easy to get to and the villa are always happy to drop you off. The breakfast each day was lovely and we also enjoyed some other meals like a delicious BBQ and cocktails in our villa as well as some wonderful spa treatments. The whole experience was so personal and you really felt like you were the only guests there. We would definitely recommend Aradhana to anyone who is looking for a relaxing and blissful stay in Bali!

The kitchen and living room were in the open space and you could rent a bbq machine and the staff would grill the meat for you. The room was clean and cozy of course. And the bathroom was to die for.

We were delayed by 2 hours due to DPS's amazing baggage handling but he waited and greeted us with a smile.\n\nThe staff are truly wonderful, so kind and willing to help. They provide excellent customer service. \n\nThe villa was lovely, the pool was perfect, everything was very clean, the grounds and plants were gorgeous. There are a lot of Villas in Canggu but this is a special place. It is only 400 meters to a beautiful beach and very walk-able to a number of restaurants. There is also a little store down the road if you need to grab some water or Bintang.\n\nYou can rent a scooter from them and they can arrange transport to other places in Bali. The driver they arranged to Ubud was a very nice guy.\n\nIf you are looking for a spot in Canggu, stay here, you won't be disappointed. Four nights was not enough!!",

              "text": "We enjoyed 2 wonderful weeks in a 2 bedroom villa at Aradhana Villas.  The villa itself was large & comfortable with a decent sized pool for the kids to play in.  The staff were always very friendly and happy to help in any way.  They offer a 24 hour reception service as well as free transport from the villa to Canggu or Seminyak which we found very flexible.  Room service meals were available throughout the day which was great for the times we didn't want to leave the villa.  The staff served us breakfast in our villa each morning & the menu was generous & the food was good.\n\nThe villa is located about 500 m from Canggu Beach and is quite an easy walk with kids.  It is nearby Finns Beach Club and whole range of gorgeous cafes & restaurants are just down the road.  Plus the Canggu Club is a 5 min ride by car and even in traffic, Seminyak is only about 15 mins drive.\n\nWe have been to Bali many times and have tended to stay in Umalas or Seminyak.  Having had such a wonderful experience at Aradhana and in Canggu we wouldn't consider staying anywhere else.  The other great thing is how peaceful and quiet it was at our villa.  Even when we knew there were other guests in the surrounding villas, noise never travelled and we felt like we had the place to ourselves.\n\nWe would highly recommend Aradhana Villas and staying in Canggu.",

The Villa's are absolutely stunning, beautiful tropical garden surroundings, private pool,  outdoor shower and beautiful indoor shower and bath,  the bed was luxurious, gorgeous outdoor undercover living and dining area & kitchen. The Villas are serviced daily and cleanliness is of the highest standard.\n\nThe staff are the lovliest people we have met. So friendly, kind, polite, always happy and accommodating, extremely professional and will go out of their way to do anything for you. \n\nThe food was incredible with a large selection to choose from and excellent presentation. The Nasi Goreng was the best we have ever eaten.\n\nThey have a shuttle service and will organise bike hire, tours, restaurant bookings etc. Anything you want they will do for you.\n\nWe wouldn't stay anywhere else.\n\nThank you Ariani, Cita, Sugita, Ratna, Onik and all the staff at Aradhana Villas, apologies we couldn't remember everyone's name!\n\nWe didn't want to leave and can't wait to go back!\n\nAlex & Jacqui James",

The staff were very helpful and spoke good english. For those that use it, the WIFI was excellent, stronger than Kuta! The bathroom downstairs was amazing with a great semi outdoor bath. Only downside really , if you can call it that is that a cab was needed to get everywhere, so make sure you take a card with you when going out at night as some taxi drivers didn't know where it was. If you stay here thoroughly recommend a trip to echo beach, watching the sunset whilst sitting on beanbags and enjoying great well priced food.",

              "text": "We just recently spent 7 nights in Aradhana's 2 bedroom Villa No 8.  It was simply stunning.  Our two kids ( 9 & 6 ) absolutely loved having their own pool and being able to jump in for a swim at any time of the day without leaving the villa was great.  The Service was fantastic and the staff were just beautiful.  The free shuttle into Seminyak and Canggu area's was a great bonus and very necessary as Canggu has no footpaths and not the best for walking.  If you do go into Seminyak, make sure you catch a BLUEBIRD taxi back to the Villa  ( the real ones have Bluebird typed on their front windscreen, there are plenty of fakes so be aware )  When you give directions, you can tell them that Aradhana Villas are near Finn's Beach Club, as they often have no idea where the Villa's are.  That leads me to Finns Beach Club, an absolute must to visit, whether it be with or without kids, its awesome. Much better than Potato Head or Ku De Ta and much more reasonably priced.   If there are no Day Beds available when you arrive, place your name down straight away to go on the wait list.  You will be glad you did.  I would go back to Canggu just for Finns. Loved it.  Can spend all day there.   \nBack to Aradhana, the BBQ cooked in your Villa was scrumptious and soooo much food.   The daily breakfast is delicious and always felt full well into the afternoon.\nThe beds were super comfy however we did feel that the bedrooms were too far apart and therefore my husband and I slept with a child each and failed to get any time alone.  All in all, it was a great memorable holiday and beautiful location. Once you get used to the location of the Villa then you will relax.  Only 1 big fault, they do not do Cocktails.  Just beer. If we travel here again as a family we will go with another family so we don't feel so secluded.   A big thanks to the wonderful, hard working staff.",

The staff were friendly and willing to help. The local beach was relaxed and quiet, yet walking distance from some great food and drink spots (Finns, La Laguna, etc). Having said that, the food at the Villas was so good, we often ordered room service!\n\nWe highly recommend Aradhana Villas to anyone looking to escape the craziness and relax in pure bliss.",

This time we kicked the holiday off with a 10 night stay at Aradhana Villas.\n We cannot fault the villas. My wife loves it here. Extremely friendly and competent staff, so very accommodating with anything you may need. Your villa is thoroughly cleaned each day and the bed linen also changed each day.\n A small number of restaurants and cafes are appx a 500m walk, take a small flash light as the road is a little dark at night, but safe. You will not be disappointed if you choose to dine in house, the food is excellent and reasonably priced. If there was one suggestion we could make, it would be the inclusion of a Cocktail / Spirit or Wine list as there is only beer and soft drink available. So take some duty free.\n Another tip is to give them a days notice if you want your complimentary in room BBQ and massages etc.\n You will not be disappointed if you choose to stay at the Aradhana, it is quiet yet easily accessible to the main locations of Seminyak or Canggu with the complimentary transport.\n A big thankyou to all staff at Aradhana for a job well done and for making our stay what it was. A special mention to the manager Mrs Ariani for having such a talented team.\n             Paul & Megs",

If you are after nightlife then Seminyak or Kuta may be more your thing however if you want a more authentic Bali stay Canggu is for you. \n\nRestaurants in Canggu are less than half the price of nearby Seminyak and the quality is exceptional. \n\nCannot recommend thus place highly enough. Ps massage at the villa was divine. Been coming to Bali for many years and this was the best massage I have ever experienced\n\n",

              "text": "We stayed for 7 nights as part of a Scoopon deal in the one bedroom villa. The villa itself is fantastic - a great outdoor area, lovely pool and gardens and semi-outdoor bathroom. The housekeeping service is perfect - everything you need is provided, including bottled water. The villa is a close walk to the beach, but be warned, the entrance to the beach is terribly littered and deserted. It can look uninviting at first but if you persist and walk a little further you will find it is a nice walk along the beach to Finns Beach Club (go left) and Echo Beach (go right). It would be too dark to walk at night though. Also, be wary there are lots of local dogs around which gang up and bark at you on the way from the villa to the beach. You can walk along the beach to Seminyak which is quite a bit further but a lovely walk along the ocean. There are some little shacks on the beach near the villa offering hire of sun loungers etc ($5) which is a great way to spend the day. To get to Canggu town it is necessary to have a scooter ($6 per day). The drop-off service is great but you still need to get back to the villa. They provide bicycles which is fantastic, but the traffic can get very bad so we only ever took the bicycles for short distances. The food at the villa (although exquisitely presented) is average overall. The staff are friendly but we did have some trouble being understood whenever we needed assistance such as ordering breakfast or booking a scooter - it was often a very slow and confused process. As for the Scoopon extras, we were entitled to two free full body massage - we would not recommend it. I tried to swap the full body massage for a foot massage hoping this might be better but was told that wasn't allowed. If you want to take advantage of any of the Scoopon lunches and dinners you are entitled to you have to give 1 days notice - I understand this for the BBQ dinner but did not understand why 1 days notice is needed for the other meals which are all on the menu. Often you do not know a day in advance whether you would like to go out for dinner or stay in so this was an annoyance. Without these small issues our stay would have been flawless. However, overall we did have an excellent time.",

The room was fantastic and private, sometimes the only other people we saw were the staff bringing in our meals. \nThe villas are surrounded by rice fields and is rural but very close to plenty of restaurants and bars in Canggu and 30 mins from Seminyak. The free drop off service is perfect for this. The staff are lovely and more than willing to go above and beyond. We would highly recommend the villas to anyone.",

The outdoor bathroom and shower was great as was our own private pool. You order your breakfast the night before and is delivered to your villa at the time you request. Great food, we had no complaints, we also had a couple of our evening meals in our villa and again the quality was very good.  Canguu is a little bit out of the way but the free shuttle service really compensates for that and as long as you organise that the night before or first thing in the morning, you will have no problem.  The wifi was great and we organised a couple of day trips on line so again being a little bit out of the way presented no issues for us. Also it is within walking distance to the new Finns Beach club, which is also worth a visit.  Thank you everyone at Aradhana villas, we had a great time.",

Certainly a place to experience and keep on experiencing. The staff were so friendly and accomodating. Thanks to all who made our holiday amazing. Just a short drive to Echo Beach and a 5 minute walk to Berewa Beach which was also amazing.",

Beautiful gardens surrounded the outdoor lounge, kitchenette and bathroom. The bedroom had a comfortable king size bed and air con. Breakfast each day was from a large menu selection. We had a lunch, BBQ dinner and afternoon refreshments as well. All meals served in your villa and delivered quite quickly and all very delicious. The villas are near Berawa Beach which was not the nicest in Bali. Close to Finns Beach Club. Didn't swim much at the beaches as the waves were really rough while we were there. The Villas are a fair distance away from the main tourist areas. More country area but being developed. Lots of rice fields around. Aradhana provided shuttle which we used to get to Seminyak and taxis to get back which didn't cost too much. Overall really nice place to stay if you want to get out of Kuta, Legian or Seminyak.",

The pool water was always clear and cool which was a great delight. The staff were very helpfull, friendly and accommodating. Breakfast delivered to you every morning and always beautifully presented. We spent our time lazing around,reading and cooling off in the pool while butterflies flew in and about. The location is out amongst the rice paddies which makes it very quiet. We recommend these villas to those who like the slower, restful holiday.",

The villas are pure Balinese paradise, whilst being clean and practically brand new. \n\nA perfect quiet spot just a short walk to the beach, or hire a scooter for about $8AUD a day and visit the amazing beach towns up and down the coast.\n\nThe hotel offers a free shuttle to Seminyak which is a trendier suburb of Bali but still as busy as Kuta. But the restaurants in walking (or scooter) distance offer a great variety and quality.\n\nHowever the food served in the Villas is restaurant quality, in fact it's probably better than most restaurants we went to, and the BBQ is highly recommended.\n\nOverall, whether you're after a romantic getaway, a family holiday or just somewhere to actually relax- the location, beauty, peace and serenity (the property is surrounded by fields and bushes), the friendliness and warmth of the staff, the attention to detail and luxury, the food, the tropical gardens and design, make this hidden gem a perfect choice.\n\nNext time we return to Bali we won't want to stay anywhere else.",

A great little warung just around the corner.\n i would definitely stay again.\nFor independent movement,  I consider you need a motor scooter/bike in this location, there are so many great foodie things within a short ride. traffic is not as manic as seminyak area.\nEvery time we returned to the villa, we received a warm \"welcome home\" which was lovely.",

The staff were very friendly and very helpful. The villa is very quiet and private with lots of space and a decent sized pool. The in villa Balinese BBQ is a must do as well as the massages. Only issue we had was the location as my husband and I like to go into kuta and legian. The shuttle needs to be booked in advance and will only go to seminyak and the traffic to go into seminyak is pretty hectic making it difficult. Otherwise we had a fantastic getaway! ",

The breakfast is generous and yummy and served in your villa at the time you choose!\nThe airport pick up we transferred one to pick us up from a previous hotel, they were on time and very friendly, and our driver on our departure to the airport was lovely and smiley! \nThe villas are a short walk to the beach but it is the deserted part of the beach. They're not in the heart of canggu but from our few days canggu is pretty spread out so nowhere is going to be spot on! It's walking distance to berawa and a little further but easily walking distance to old mans! ( a scooter in canggu is pretty necessary I think)\nBUT we booked directly, paid a deposit and were to pay the remainder when there. On arrival I enquirer about paying but they said wait till the end, so I asked if I could pay AUD or if I had to pay IDR. IDR was the response and as I only had an AUD value I asked for the IDR value so I would gave the money. Come pay day the rate had gone up up up and when I questioned this it was a big 3 hr drama. Eventually I paid what I was told on the first instance but my advice would be stay here, but pay before you do!\nStaff were otherwise lovely a little inefficient but fine. Don't rely on the free shuttle it's rarely available.\nOverall a nice villa",

We had never been to Bali so feeling a bit daunted & not sure of the location but needn't have worried there was always someone to help out with advice & suggestions. Went on a few tourist ventures but could have easily spent all our time in the luxuy of the villa. Went for a few walks to the beach & bakery & all the locals were friendly and not in our face. Would recommend these villas to anyone but may be better if they stay a secret (make it easier to book next visit). Have just returned home absolutely refreshed.",

The accommodation was expansive with a lovely big pool, terraced lawn area, outdoor kitchen and pagoda and beautiful open bathrooms. The two bedrooms however were  un-connected rooms on different levels and locked separately which is not ideal with young children but would perfectly suit older/teenage children or two couples travelling together. Each room also had its own fabulous bathroom. The staff were incredible and particularly kind, generous and attentive with our children. The food was excellent, the drivers knowledgeable and the reception staff attentive and accommodating.  A fabulous experience overall.",

I had never been to Bali before and since staying here I will visit once a year at least ! \nMe and my partner stayed in a one bedroom villa. The pool was amazing! Every morning at around 8am the water features would turn on so all day until late at night you would hear a tranquil flowing water sound. \nThe free breakfast daily was amazing ! It offers Both local dishes (mi goreng and Nasi goreng) and western style brekkie like eggs benny, omelette and pancakes. You also receive a freshly squeezed juice a fruit platter and a side as well. We always chose the French toast ! We never got sick of the breakfast menu it had a great variety and we were always very full afterwards. \nWe did order room service twice (2 mains and an entree each time) our bill at the end of our stay was $50 Australian ! Such a Bargain! \nThe room had great air conditioning and was serviced daily with a complimentary refill of mini bar and toiletries. \nWe could never hear any of our neighbouring villas occupants at all. \nImpeccable service from all staff! We felt like they really looked after us ! \nThe complimentary shuttle bus saved the trouble of ordering taxis or hiring mopeds. Seminyak was about 20 mins away and the shuttle would drop us whenever we requested. \nWe once caught a taxi from Kuta back to Aradhana in peak hour traffic. It took about 45 mins and cost about $8 Australian. So the location is out of the way which makes it more relaxing but still affordable if you want to look around the more populated areas. \n\n",

The staff are friendly and attentive, whilst still being very respectful of guest privacy. The food was beautiful - and plentiful! \n\nThe villas themselves are gorgeous, every tiny detail has been perfected. I particularly loved how well thought out things like the lighting were. It's like being in your own perfect little world; we never heard another guest, even though the villas were fully booked. I honestly can't say enough positive things about Aradhana, you really have to experience it to understand the level of detail.",

We didn't want to leave our private pools. The daily in room massages were just what you want to unwind after a day of exploring.

There is not a lot nearby, but the beach is only 400 metres down the hill & we enjoyed early morning & late evening walks watching the many surfers catch the waves. The villa's also have 2 mountain bikes available to use, so do yourself a favour & get out on them, or walk the local area to one of the many coffee shops / cafes only 10 mins walk away in the main street.\nThe Villa's are well equipped with air-conditioned bedroom, private pool, outside & undercover kitchen & bathroom. Kitchen is fully equipped & you could cook yourself if you wanted to, but why would you as the in house menu was extensive, well priced & food delicious.\nOur deal included massages in the villa; a massage bed was delivered each day & the massages were fantastic, only down side was it too warm to have these outside would be better if done in the bedroom if the massage bed would fit but I doubt it.\nThe staff are amazing & very respectful of ensuring your privacy a special thanks to Ratna, Onik & Leo who made our stay a memorable one.",

              "text": "We recently spent 5 nights at Aradhana and wish we had booked our whole 8 nights we were in Bali here.  It was simply amazing.  The staff are outstanding, every detail is taken care of.  We were here over \"silent day\"  which was a new experience, not being able to leave the villa complex, having the private villa was great.  There are so many pluses I'm sure we sill miss something.\nWe arrived the day prior to silent day we were offered for the driver to take us to the mini mart to get supplies, not being able to go out the next day this was great.  \nThe villa was absolutely beautiful.  Very nicely set up with everything at our fingertips.  We spent a lot of time at the villa relaxing and swimming in the pool.  We ate a few meals here all were good, highly recommend the Balinese BBQ.  There was a good variety to choose from for breakfast.  Breakfast was chosen the day before and served in our villa the next morning.  The table being set perfectly, it was such a treat eating breakfast by the pool every morning.\nWhen writing a review I think often the house keeping staff are missed.  Due to silent day we saw them in full action. The pool was beautifully cleaned as was the whole villa.  It wasn't just a quick dust over it was cleaned to perfection, clean sheets and towels, floors mopped, used dishes and mini bar replenished.  At night mozzie coils were lit, a plug in mozzie thing was placed in the room, curtains drawn and lights turned on.\nThe Villas are a little out of the way which was perfect for us, it was so lovely and quiet.  There is a shuttle service to take you to Canggu area and Seminyak.  A taxi to Seminyak was around $5 AUD sometimes under, sometimes over depending on traffic.\nA special mention to the staff and their outstanding service, they made our trip a memorable one.  The attention to detail was amazing.  Our last day our flight was a late one, we were given a late check out of 6pm which made it so much easier for us.  We did some last minute shopping and were surprised to come back to a perfectly cleaned villa and replenished mini bar, something we certainly did not expect, but was a pleasant surprise.\nThere is so much more I can say, but I think you can see from the reviews what a wonderful Villa this is to stay at.  Ten out of ten, it ticks all the boxes, We want to go back already!",

Reliable when called upon and deliver with excellence. This includes the drivers. All are very friendly.\n\nAccommodation: Pool was clean + comfortable temperature all day, bedroom is serviced/maintained when you go out to enjoy yourself. Pillows and beds are comfortable. Bathroom and Toilet are sheltered, although open and ventilated to the elements. These are also well-maintained and have a mix of contemporary and traditional styles. \n\nFood: Varieties in Indonesian and Western cuisine. Delicious and consistent! Nasi goreng was very nice (I ordered it for brekky 5 days straight, IDC, that's some good nasi goreng!) and fresh fruit + juices + tea provided also. We also had the Balinese BBQ for dinner, was very pleasant also. \n\nI'd like to thank Aradhana Villas for an awesome and safe place to stay. Sugita, I owe you Bintang. \n\nCheers.",

              "text": "These villas are not short of gorgeous! The pool is a good size, private and a comfortable water temperature. Although it was very hot the air conditioner coped well in the bedroom.\nThe villas are well equipped with quality toiletries and linen. More space for luggage/clothes would have been useful.\nThe staff were pleasant, ever present and eager to please. \nThe food was delicious and generous with serving size. \nThe villas are close to Berawa Beach, 400 metres, but this beach is quite dirty and not suitable for swimming. However a short stroll along the beach either way good swimming and surfing and cafes are found.\nA paper map of the locality would have been most helpful, but wasn't available.\nCanggu is a quiet village with rice paddies, suited us, we were never hassled by hawkers while out walking. But some would prefer staying where there is more action.\nAnother suggestion to improve the villas would be to key the locks alike. There are four locks to the villa with four different keys, a tad frustrating. \nOverall we were most satisfied and would happily return.",

If you like the hustle and bustle of Kuta/Seminyak , then this is not for you.Aradhana villas is located in quite street just few minutes away from main strip of Canggu and about 15 minutes from Seminyak  They offer complimentary drop off services to Canggu and Semniyak, we did not really use this as we hired a scooter which was organised through the villa [very reasonable price]. Great service from all the staff, they are all very attentive and remember even the tiniest details. \nWe had quite a few meals in our villa and they were all very delicious\u2026 Wide variety for breakfast\u2026seafood BBQ cooked in the villa is highly recommended\nIf you are after a private gateway, this is perfect.. Villas are all very private and intimate with all meals served in the villa. Massage and spa is the villa was great",

The staff were amazing and couldn't have been more accomodating, our compliments to the chef..meals were awesome. We looked forward to coming \"home\" after our day trips to our villa where we would relax and enjoy the complimentary mini bar inc a cpl Bin Tangs and take a dip in the gorgeous pool  :)\nAny aussies who know the real estate advert with hubby telling the wife to keep a poker face well this was me when shown thru the villa ...WOW!! The only thing we could fault was there is no steps from the pool to the seated outdoor area so we had to walk back thru  our room to get back outside, would be handy. Highly recommend a stay here. .pure bliss thankyou :-) ",

Beautiful lush garden through the villas with a gorgeous outdoor bath, rain shower, kitchenette and pool. We bought the scoopon voucher and had a complimentary seafood bbq, daily breakfast, 2 lunches and 4 one hour massages, It was the perfect place to come home to after spending the day on activities all over Bali. Can't recommend it enough. The complimentary drop offs to Seminyak square were really awesome to.",

This place is a stunning retreat from the hustle and bustle of Seminyak but still close enough to pop down for shopping, drinks and pampering. \nNot that you'll need to go far, because the food at the villa is just as good as you'll find out on the Main Street of Seminyak. So a quite night in is a must. \nThe Villa's themselves are inviting and well presented, and the open plan outdoor living adds a feeling of space to the tropical little sanctuary that is each villa.\nWe've stayed in both the two bedroom villa and the one bedroom villa, and both are as lovely as each other.\nThe staff are friendly and polite and always helpful, Onik especially so, she has beautiful English and always keen to make you stay a pleasant one.\nThe in room massage is one of the best massages I've had in bali, and I've been visiting bali about 13years.\nThis villa is a truly lovely place tucked away in unspoilt Canggu! If you are looking for a bali experience that is slightly more authentic than the clammer of Kuta I'd throughly recommend Canggu and Aradhana Villas. You won't be disappointed!   ",

This was our first time out in Canguu and it was a lovely, peaceful start to our holiday.  \n\nLocated about 5 minutes from Splash Water Park Aradhana Villas are nestled amongst rice paddies, a much quieter pace than the hustle and bustle of Seminyak.  The villas are more traditional Balinese in design, with an open air living area, overlooking the infinity edge pool and grassed area (perfect for our kids to run around).  Our favourite feature was the day beds in the pool, allowing for relaxation whilst watching the kids swim.\n\nThe main bedroom was located downstairs whilst the upstairs had an additional bathroom and open air bathroom.  The beds were comfortable and the villas were kept in pristine condition.\n\nThe staff make your stay extra special and go above and beyond to make sure your stay is enjoyable.  Transport to and from restaurants was included and made it easy to venture into Seminyak when we needed to.  We can't thank the staff at Aradhana enough for being so lovely.\n\nDefinitely recommend staying at Aradhana Villas in Canguu for a peaceful, relaxing holiday.",

Stepping into the villa and seeing the HUGE pool (which you can jump into from the bedroom) was such a delight. The decor is quite a traditional style, which adds to the charm. The semi-outdoor bathroom is also beautiful to have a bath underneath the stars. You have a lot of privacy as well, the only disturbances are room service calling out every now and then. \n\nIn regards to the location, it is 5 minutes from the main strip in Canggu, and 15 minutes from Seminyak. They also offer complimentary drop off services which is really useful. But, you can also rent scooters to zip around town.\n\nThe staff are so lovely and really attentive, they remember every little detail. Big thanks to Ari and Yoshi, who really helped us out during our stay - they were so friendly and welcoming!\n\nI'm really glad that we found this place. I highly recommend to anyone who wants to have a peaceful and well-serviced stay in Bali.",

The bedroom isn't sealed- spiders, mozzies and gecko poo (on the bed!) to deal with; and the aircon struggled. Although generous with mini-bar & water, no coffee/tea etc is provided. Breakfast was odd - one staff brings random trays that were never quite right. A massive bbq -quantity not quality (so much waste). By the time we found great local stuff, we were leaving. Guests would have better time if AV gave out local info -like dinner on Echo Beach and the fabulous supermarket Canggu Station. HINT:take own supplies of coffee, milk, snacks etc (stock up at the Station on the way). We have fond memories, but no WOW factor.",

The villa itself was incredible and looks just like the pictures, the perfect place for a relaxing holiday.  The location is ideal if you want something a little quieter as it is a 15 minute drive to Seminyak.  There is however a beach nearby which is about a 5 minute walk away where you can join the locals to watch the sunset. (By the way the corn sold on the beach is very tasty!)  The staff are what makes Aradhanna Villas spectacular as they all go out of their way to accommodate your every need.  Thank you especially to Onik, Yoshi and Sugita who we saw most but we also thank all the rest of the staff who work at Aradhanna.  We hope to be back one day in the future as it was our favourite place we stayed in whilst in Bali.",

The area is quiet and the Villas tranquil.\nThe staff here are very friendly, attentive and helpful.  Nothing was too much trouble.\nI would highly recommend these Villas to anyone travelling to Bali.  You have the peace and tranquility of the country side and just a short ride (via hotel car) to bustling Seminyak.\nThe villa was very clean and the pool was fantastic and service was excellent.  We will definitely be returning to Aradhana Villas in the future.\n\nThank you for a memorable stay.",

I have to admit it was a little worrying that it wasn't right in the hustle and bustle of Bali but that's what made it so special. You wouldn't even know if someone else was staying there. We hired a bike which gets you around to the cafes and restaurants which are very close and many options. Staying here actually made us appreciate Bali more and saw a different side that we want to come back to. As for the staff, BEAUTIFUL. EVERYONE was so accommodating and helpful in every way possible. They were always smiling and going out of their way to making your stay amazing. The Villas are very clean and set out well. The beds are very comfy and linen always clean and changed daily. Pool kept clean and great aircon. The food, amazing. Breakfast everyday was always fresh and very good. We also had dinners and lunch and it was always delivered fast hot and yummy. \nI would like to thank all the staff for making our stay one of our most amazing memories. Even when we had ash cloud issues and our flight was cancelled and I was in a panic it was very comforting knowing that staff were trying to accommodate if we couldn't get there on time.\nThank you everyone again and we miss you already.",

Wasn't long enough!! \n\nALL staff were absolutely beautiful at all hours of the days (including our 11pm flight), and we were treated like royalty. Shout out to Ari and Yoshi who really went above and beyond to ensure our stay was great. \n\nVery peaceful (and private) location, we never saw any other guests during our stay (although the villas were actually booked with guests in them). Pool was beautiful temperature so it was easy to enjoy, we did lots of swimming! \nWent into Seminyak for shopping and restaurants (about 15 minutes drive). Echo beach was also a great spot for dinner. \n\nThe villa was ultimate luxury, and was serviced daily. Airport transfers and Complimentary drop off service was excellent and very helpful. Daily breakfast was delicious, especially the banana pancakes. The bbq cooked in our villa was awesome and very tasty (Balinese bbq was my favourite). Daily massages were so peaceful and top quality. \n\nHighly recommend for both a relaxing holiday, or getting out and about in Seminyak and surrounds.",

              "text": "Recently spent 10 nights in a one bedroom villa and this is without a doubt the best Villa I have ever stayed in. Wife and I spent our honeymoon here and we were absolutely blown away by not only the villas themselves but all of the fantastic staff that work here to make Aradhana Villas an amazing place to stay. Right from the moment we were picked up at the airport (2AM) until we were dropped off we were treated like royalty. The villas themselves are located in a quiet little area of Changgu surrounded by rice paddy fields and only a short 5 minute walk to the beach. Newly opened less than a year ago they have done an amazing job of designing and furnishing these villas, from the moment you enter your private residence through lovely Balinese gardens past your  outdoor covered dining and lounge area that is next to the private pool to your one bedroom villa they have gone all out to create a quiet, tranquil oasis.\nOur package included daily massages, breakfasts and some meals and we took full advantage of these. Breakfast highlits would be the seasonal friut platter, watermelon juice and the omlettes. We left our villa to do our daily holiday making full enough that lunch was always a distant thought. \nArandhana villas is situated at Changgu and it is only about 10 minutes walk to Old Mans beach and Echo beach is about 20 minutes walk along the beach where there is always a great wave and plenty of places to eat and have a cold beer, i would recommend hiring a scooter to get around the area as it is not that busy and hectic like Legian and Seminyak\nThe most outstanding feature of Aradhana is without a doubt the awesome staff that work here. They were always happy and friendly and willing to do anything for us.Onic, Sawenda, Yoshi and the rest of the crew were fantastic and as I was informed as they have all started at the villa as new staff at the same time when it opened they all feel like they are one big family and they make you feel like you are a part of it.\nIf you are looking for a Villa in Bali that is in a quieter area...do yourself a favour, check these guys out. You will not be dissapointed...we will be heading back!!",

You have your own little kitchen area with gas cooktop, kettle & blender.  The only suggestion I can make is that maybe they need to provide you with tea & coffee so you can make your own during the day. ",

Our special thanks to go to Ori, Onik, Suardhana, Apsari and Sugita to name a few. Special thanks to Ariani who runs the team.\n\nThe villa is nicely furnished and gives a nice secluded look.\n\nThe only downside is that it is away from the touristy track but that is also a blessing! And they also offer complimentary drop off to Seminayak.\n\nIf you are considering staying at Aradhana then go ahead - you won't regret it.",

The villa itself was stunning and had everything you could need. The food from the hotel, including breakfast, was also reasonably priced and delicious. The hotel staff were phenomenally helpful and sourced drivers and taxis as well as recommending restaurants. The service was truly outstanding (especially Yoshi) and we were made to feel very welcome. Even had a cake brought to me on my birthday! Would 100% recommend this hotel to anybody looking for a peaceful get away in Bali.",

Although a little out of the way but we didn't mind it was great to use the complimentary bikes to ride around the area and then when we returned to our villa It was great to laze by your own private pool. \nBreakfast everyday was delicious and the BBQ dinner in the villa was amazing. We also enjoyed our daily 30min messages (which we combined into 1x90min and 2x60min) \nWe definitely left aradhana very pampered and relaxed. The staff were all amaz ing and friendly and always welcomed you home each day by name\nWe will definitely be back. Thank you Aradhana",

We have stayed for 10 nights and they have made us feel like this is our home away from home. The one bedroom villa is elegant and yet relaxed in that Balinese style you come for. It is in a very quiet street which when you see how busy many places in Bali are, you will appreciate this area. Yet, with the drop off service provided into Canggu and Seminyak it is still close by to the shopping and restaurants. You may find flashier places, more expensive places, or busier places, but for us, this is the place we will be coming back to for that special Bali feeling.",

The massages are also in your villa with a very comfortable massage table. The massages were excellent. For a relaxing holiday this was perfect for us. The villas are in a great location, 5min from the tourist destinations ($4-5 taxi away) but quiet and no traffic noise. \nWe will be back for another blissful, relaxing stay. \n\n",

Even down to the smaller things like a traditional Bali welcome drink and an iced tea on departure - so thoughtful! Staff were always at the front desk to farewell us each day and greet us on return! Canggu is perfect for a Bali getaway without the madness of Kuta and Legian, hosting Canggu Station (mini grocery store), Canggu Club, cafes and close enough to Seminyak by scooter. Highly recommend Aradhana, we will definitely be returning.",

Also the fact that you could jump in you private pool from the bedroom in awesome :)\n\n2 times a day the villa staff is refreshing the mosquito coil, so even though most of the villa is outside this is not much of an problem. Better bring some additional mosquito spray.\n\nStaff is very discrete and allowed privacy if needed, but at the same time they are always there to serve your wishes.\n\nFree shuttle service is provided to towns close by or if you need to purchase something outside.",

The villa was cleaned daily, with mossie coils lit for the evening, not that we saw any. The bed and pillows  were comfortable. The outdoor bathroom was very romantic, with the bath an excellent size for two. The gardens and pool were excellent. The only downside was not many restaurants within walking distance. Easily rode the Villas push bikes to beach. Courtesy bus available to take you into Seminyak.",

I have never stayed somewhere with such exceptional and personal service! Not to mention the huge, very clean, spacious and relaxing villas! Because there are only 8 villas you feel like the only guests. The staff went out of their way in every regard. From the drop off service (brilliant), to restaurant recommendations and bookings to rearranging massages to suit us and bringing me coffee first thing each morning, the service was faultless. Ariana heads a brilliant team, Ari and Oink exceptional. Yoshi waited 2 hours at the airport for us after a delayed flight and was still smiling! On the last day we were unable to have a late checkout (for a red eye flight) as new guests were arriving. I was 29 weeks pregnant so the girls moved heaven and earth to accommodate us until 1pm and arrange for us to transport to a nice hotel in kuta for the day. We couldnt be more happy or thankful. Nothing was ever a stress or a worry. The breakfasts were amazing as were the massages. The complimentary mini bar was a great addition.We were so happy with every aspect of or stay. The location is out of the way and quiet (what we wanted) but the drop off service gives you the option to shop, sight see and dine in Seminyak (or close by). A taxi is about $10 home. We dines at Bambu, La Luccino and Sardine. Highly recommend all 3. The staff even cooked us a cake for our wedding anniversary. Thank you Aradhana! You were awesome!!! xx",

The pool for a villa is very generous and the villa is just stunning- I loved the styling and it was perfectly clean the whole time. The staff were simply gorgeous- the most lovely people, very professional and polite. The breakfast in the morning was simple and delicious, served in your Villa in the 'lounge room/dining section.'  We will definitely be back- It's my new happy place!",

This property is newly on the market and exceeded my expectations to say the least. From the staff, the grounds and the area itself it truly was a relaxing trip and the getaway that we needed. We stayed in villa 8 which was a two bedroom pool villa, we felt like we were staying in a large property, it was so spacious and the pool was always the right temperature to have a midnight swim. This is the perfect place to stay if you want to be away from Seminyak but a short ride into Seminyak and Legian. The staff were always so accommodating to all of there guest and always held such professionalism and had genuine care for their guest. I am a travel agent myself and with a short walk to amazing coffee shops, minutes away from the beautiful beaches and restaurants Canggu is the place to be and definitely to property I will be recommending. For my clients.The value for money at this property was fantastic. We were lucky enough to have amazing 4 course breakfast sent to our villa everyday, massages, afternoon tea and the complimentary drop off service to Canggu and Seminyak anytime we needed. I travelled with a family and there baby of 5 months and before we walked in the door they had the cot set up in the right place, the facilities they required for the baby and they always checked on us every couple of hours to see if we were happy.

A beautifully appointed large and spacious villa with tropical gardens and great private pool.\nEverything you see on the website pictures will match your expectations.\nBreakfasts are awesome as are all their meals and drinks which are reasonably priced. The property is a little out of the way of the busier tourist areas but there are nearbye cafes and restaurants 10 minutes walk away. If your comfortable hire yourself a scooter to have some flexibility.\nCredit to the entire staff from front desk to housekeeping with special mention to Wayan the Manager,well done.",

Every request of ours was attended to during our weekly stay there. The Villas themselves are located about 30 mins drive from Seminiyak Square - so its perfect if you want a quiet location away from the busy areas - yet want easy access to the nightlife in Seminiyak if you want to explore it. I would highly recommend these Villas - and a special mention to the front desk staff and the chef - who were all just brilliant",

I would suggest perhaps spraying twice a day rather than the once that the staff do at 6.30 pm. The location is very quiet and a bit away from the shops etc. Perfect for a romantic getaway. The driver provided will run you into Canguu or Seminyak. Staff at the desk and the drivers were fabulous. Always smiling and nothing was too much trouble. Would highlty recommend if you wanted a secluded villa away from Kuta/Legian. Mini bar restocked every day. Bintang by your own pool listening to the frogs and the cyciads.....perfect!",

Always greeted you with a smile and made you feel right at home. The service was exceptional and the villa was just incredible. We stayed in the two bedroom villa, which was very modern and comfortable. The infinity pool was surrounded by lush greenery, which made it feel like your very own little oasis. A huge gourmet breakfast was served daily in the villa, which was just delicious! It was in a quiet location amongst the rice paddies, but only a 10 minute bike ride to the beach. Canggu is a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle, but within easy access to Seminyak and shopping, especially with the free drop off service. However, with the number of top quality cafes and restaurants now in the area you don't even have to leave. I couldn't fault this accommodation in any way. We didn't want to leave and will definitely make Aradhana our only choice when staying in Bali!",

Never had an issue on our stay which was 10 days. The drop of service was extremely helpful, and the villa staff made it super easy to organise a scooter when we wanted one. Anyone who has said it is too far away from everything is a bit of a sook really. You have the drop off service available and cabs are cheap if you know how to barter anyway. I would stay here again and again. ",

A friend and I stayed in a 2 bedroom villa for a week and could not say anything negative about the place or the staff! The food is amazing, and breakfast is always served so promptly- with such a big menu we still didn't have time to try it all! We had both a 3 course lunch and a BBQ dinner served on our villa and the BBQ was cooked in our villa by a chef! We had massages everyday and they set up in the villa so you can stay comfortable where you are!  The staff are so helpful and want to do anything to keep guests happy- a love man named Yoshi came and helped us remove a large frog from the bathroom! There are bicycles you can take down the road to the local shops as well. The only downside is not of the villas or staff but the location as it was a new area it was hard for taxi drivers to find. However, after the 2nd day we had decided to take a google map print out and we were fine!",

The staff was so kind and caring, young smiling people who did their best and beyond to make us feel mostly welcome. The villa was great, luxurious and extremely cosy, with privite pool. There was free shuttle service in Canggu area, we spent a few days at Echo beach-really great place with nice young surfers, good restaurants and those amazing sunsets just 10 minutes drive from the Villas. Wonderful breakfast with fresh fruits. It was a real pleasure to return after a day full of adventure to our Bali home. Thank you, friends, for taking such good care of us! Bali and Aradhana Villas are in our hearts! Hope we meet again!",

              "text": "My girlfriend and I purchased a Scoopon for 5 nights at Aradhana Villas during May, 2015.  We were unsure what to expect as originally there were no reviews and this was a relatively new establishment.   \n\nThe customer service at Aradhana was excellent, they were happy to go out of the way to ensure every demand is met, including calling nearby pharmacies and booking trips (such as the Night Zoo) for us.   We also found the drop off service to be really impressive, were always happy to take us to Seminyak/Canggu and it was generally around $3-$5 to return by taxi depending on the location.   They were even happy to drop us off at Bali berries (amazing Frozen Yoghurt) one night at around 10:00pm when we were craving some dessert, then wait and bring us back!\n\nI thought the location was great, in a really quiet, pretty sort of area where you could walk around peacefully and fall asleep at night.   It was only around 500m from the beach however as others have mentioned it was quite dirty and not really suitable for swimming considering the large swell.   It\u2019s about a 12 minute drive to Seminyak and you\u2019ll always be able to find a taxi to bring you back for under 5 bucks AUS.  If you\u2019re looking for something closer, they do serve a variety of food at the Villa (we had a fantastic lunch and BBQ dinner), or there are restaurants (such as Bettlenut/ Roti Canai) which are a short drive away.\n\nThe Villa was really nice with an outdoor kitchen/bathroom and heaps of plants by the pool.   The room was well air conditioned and television had quite a few channels (although the reception isn\u2019t great).  We found the breakfasts to be more than satisfying although the juices were very watery.  Mini bar was also stocked up each day which was fantastic.  Free Wifi as well.\n\nOverall hard to find the negatives and what was a fantastic 5 days, was amazing to get back to the Villa at the end of the day and just relax in those beautiful surroundings.\n\nThanks to all the staff !!!\nNeil & Kathryn",

The service was amazing the girls couldn't do enough to help you, the breakfast was amazing but their fruit juices are a bit watery. They had a taxi service which dropped you off in Seminyak area which was convient as its a little way out from Seminyak, there are no shops/ restaurants within walking distance but I'm sure there will be soon as the area is developing. The villa itself was amazing I felt like I was in paradise. Daily massages and topped up our mini bar daily. I miss this place already thank you to all the staff was fantastic.",

              "text": "The property itself is new, clean and well designed. There is a large bedroom with direct access to the bathroom. The kitchen and living room with TV in the open air. The swimming pool is quite large, however water was a bit cloudy as the pump was out of work one day.\nThe staff was very nice and eager to help. The breakfasts were generally OK, with selection of fruit, main dish (fried rice, noodle, eggs, and few other choices), toasts or vegetables. The juice, although in the menu named 'fresh juice' included too much water.\n\nSmall areas for improvements regarding the quaity of service shall include forgotten towels, open door left after room service, missing cups when serving tea or coffee, but these should not be considered a key issue.\n\nThe main issue is the location, which is too far from amenities, restaurants, shops, etc. It is rather in the middle of nowhere, so after dark you could only stay in the villa and watch TV or..... The beach is approx. 400 m from the property, but it is dirty and not suitable for swimming as there are high waves all day long. The property offers a complimentary bicycles and car transport to Seminyak area, but be careful. We agreed with the reception that the driver will give us a ride to Carrefour in Kuta, waits for us approx 30 min and takes us back to the villa. During the ride the driver changed his mind and tried to leave us in Kuta and offered a paid taxi instead. After short discussion we enforced that he keeps the plan agreed with the reception or we leave the property immediately. So be very precise when you book a complimentary transport. \n  \nOverall, this is recommended if you require quiet and cosy place and do not need a beach and nightlife.",

              "text": "We spent one week in a 1 bedroom villa. The location is a little bit off the beaten tracks of Cenggu - e.g there is not much choice to find a nice warung in walking distance, however this is true for many villas in Canggu and there is a complimentary drop off service. Berawa Beach is very close, but rather dirty and not nice for a relaxed beach day. Same here: Echo beach or Potato head can be reached in 15-20 mins walking the beach or by using the drop off.\n\nMost of all: the villa has a wunderful design, the detached outdoor sitting area, the really big private pool and the garden are really marvellous. \n\nWe were not 100% convinced by the service. Although everybody is really nice and trying there are too many small issues to make it an really outstanding experience: mixed-up breakfast orders, forgotten towels, difficult negotiations to arrange the drop off, unpleasant sewer smell in the bedroom, villa doors left open by housekeeping. However, these are rather fields for improvement, no reason to be unsatisfied in general. So finally: definitely a recommendation.",

The area is quiet but I feel like in a few years it will be a busy little hub of amazing eateries and shops. \n\nThe villa was picture perfect, without any faults. Comfy beds and super pillows, air conditioning when you want it, multiple TVs, stunning pools ( however ours kept needing topping up to maintain fountains but super easy to do/have done ) beautiful facilities & the occasional wild life visitor ( rogue crab/cat )\n\nThe staff at Aradhana are also a fantastic part of this. Orik & Arri were our main 'receptionists' and those girls are wonderful. They smile constantly & their level of help & advise for the area was second to none. The beautiful lady who brought us our epic breakfast each day was also lovely. The staff who cooked our Bbq were professional and friendly and bril chefs & even the drivers were sweet and attentive. \n\nTake a push bike out around the corner and land yourself around cute cafes and beaches, rice paddies and local temples. It makes being that little bit out of Seminyak really peaceful ( read less scary around scooters etc ) \n\nI loved our stay here & have even been in contact with the girls since ( they check up to make sure everything was ok!! ) oh & definitely book a spa treatment!!! Those girls are tiny but so amazing! \n\nLoved it!",

Never had anything like this in South-East Asia. The staff is very friendly, helpful 24/7 and professional. The food, the rooms, the comfort - honestly everything is on a very high standard. I went with my parents. We received a free upgrade and enjoyed every minute. \nThere is a very good super market around the corner, plus Echo Beach and Old Mans is easy to get to with scooters or drop off. Definitely try the BBQ at Echo Beach and Desa Sari for Yoga. Amazing! Everything easy to get to from the Villa with the Scooter.",

              "text": "Stayed here on my own for a week. I had a one bedroom villa, which is basically a spacious outside living space, with a small kitchen and a living area with tv, a private swimming pool, an inside bedroom with tv and airconditioning (no mosquito net - lots of mosquito\u2019s - they do spray), and an outside bathroom with bath and shower. Wifi is good, although you do have to reconnect several times a day. You get sun loungers and a bit of garden to boot, with lovely lush trees and plants. All of it is enclosed, so it offers a lot of privacy. The beach is close by, less than five minutes walking. If you go to your left, towards Seminyak, you quickly get to Canggu\u2019s good (cleaner) beaches and beach clubs. If you go to your right, you can actually cross the river via the beach (via the water), which is a much better and quicker walk into Canggu than taking the busy roads. \nWhat I didn\u2019t enjoy, was the apparent lack of trust. They instisted on photocopying my husband\u2019s passport, even though he was leaving for the airport that same afternoon. They said they do this for everyone who visits. Furthermore, I was asked to pay seven nights in advance without being shown the room first. And they actually had a security guard do a full room check before I was allowed to check out... to make sure \u2018I hadn\u2019t forgot anything\u2019. I heard the guard tell the front desk that \u2018everything was found complete\u2019 - pretty sure that didn\u2019t mean that I hadn\u2019t left anything.",

              "text": "The service is great and warm from Ariani and her team. But we feel the actual physical setup of the villa is not great. \n\nWe took a 2 bedroom villa which is at the end of the narrow plot of land where the entire property sits on. Quite a walk in from the main road. We had a 6 year old child with us. \n\nVilla \nMost 2 bedroom villas in Bali are situated at the ends of a private pool. But this one is stacked one on top of the other. So it\u2019s a pain to climb up and down the stairs. \n\nRooms are really small for Bali villa standards. So much so we could not open up 2 suitcases flat in the room. Maybe 1, but you are left with little walking space. \n\nTried to take the clothes out and place them in the wardrobe but the wardrobe is built outside of the room, in the bathroom which is situated outside, and is very warm and humid. So if clothes are placed in there, it will become humid and smell. The wardrobe did smell and there were animal droppings on the shelves. I\u2019m certain housekeeping never bothered to check and clean the wardrobe, nor was there a system to check the work of housekeeping.  \n\nIn the bedroom, only one bedside had sockets to charge devices. Preferable to have sockets on both sides of the bed. \n\nLoungers by the pool did not come with any cushions and it was really hard and hot to lie on them. It was only after I asked for the cushions did they manage to find 4. I think the cushions should be standard instead of just rattan loungers. \n\nThe common area ie open air living room & kitchen area by the pool is tiled. This is a big mistake when building the villa as it becomes extremely slippery when there is water on it. \n\nIt\u2019s normal to walk into this space after exiting the pool, or when water from the kitchen sink gets onto the floor after washing up, or after a downpour which we did experience. And we did slip and fall on the tiled floor a few times. Adults and the child. So beware. \n\nThe refrigerator in the kitchen is installed in a cabinet which did not allow air around it to ventilate, resulting in the refrigerator not being cold at all. So we had to keep the cabinet doors open. That did not help much either. \n\nThe bedroom on the second floor had animal droppings falling onto the bed everyday. We suspect there might be insects or a small animal living in the ceiling. So even after housekeeping change the sheets after, we still return to find animal droppings on the bed \n\nFood \nBreakfast is good. Timely, tasty and the team is always quiet when setting up in the morning. Something we appreciate. \n\nWe had lunch and dinner in the villa too and it was good too. \n\nLocation \nGood location and within walking distance to restaurants and gyms in the area. \n\nAriani and her team tried to improve things for us but we feel the actual physical problems with the villa are out of her control.

              "text": "The villas are just gorgeous. Honestly, the pictures cannot capture how lovely they are. Stunning grounds, large private pool and more space than expected. The bedroom and bathroom was opposite the large outdoor living area with the pool in the middle. Staff were excellent and discretely always ensured that the villas was clean etc. \n\nWe loved the location which was close to Berawa main area and less than five minutes to the beach. Finns is also close by and we had a great time there. Do check out Avenue A - super friendly, great food and music. \n\nThe villas are equipped with a small kitchen and there is a good supermarket close by if you were inclined. I know that they do packages but my advice is to do room only like we did. Breakfast and brunch is a big deal in Canggu and you have many excellent options on your doorstep. The one morning we did have breakfast at the villas, it was cold and the coffee was standard Bali coffee. And for massage, Dream is a no frills place which offers excellent massage from 100,000 rupiah. Laundry was very overpriced and I had to send two things back. \n\nOtherwise, my only recommendations for improvement would be a coffee maker/pot (strange omission when there was a blender) and mirror in the bedroom as it was rather sweaty trying to apply make-up in the non aircon open air bathroom. \n\nIf we were coming back to Canggu, we would defo stay here again.

Amazing villas with outside lounge and dining areas and the 2 bedroom villa also had an outside bathroom. Immaculately clean swimming pools, beautifully presented gardens. Staff that are extremely friendly and helpful and beautiful breakfasts brought to our villas every morning with a smile. So happy that we chose Aradhana.",

The food was also very good with portion sizes just the right size for us. The villa was located within walking distance of Finns beach, shops and cafes. We would both highly recommen Aradhana Villas for those who want a quiet, peaceful holiday but still be able to get out and about and experience Bali.",

The villa and the staff were incredible, nothing was too much trouble and they even gave me a birthday cake and sung happy birthday. We were a bit flabbergasted by previous reviews, we had no problems with slippery tiles (we simply put a towel down) and we thought the food was awesome - try the pancakes and the Healthy Start at breakfast. We had complimentary transfers to and from the airport, a free fridge of drinks, lots of free fruit and a beautiful welcome drink. We were upgraded to the two bedroom villa for our last night and it was simply stunning! It's a 4 minute walk to the beach, a 15 minute walk to Batu Bolong and a few minutes to supermarkets, restaurants and more. I can't recommend this place enough. This is my 7th trip to Bali and it is by far one of the best places I've stayed, we simply couldn't find a fault with anything. Amazing. Thank you so much to everyone.",

From arrival to departure the wonderful friendly staff could not have been more helpful and accomodating.\nMy friend and I purchased a Luxury Escapes package which included breakfast and either a choice of lunch or dinner and daily high tea; all delicious, discount happy hour that went for 3 hours, an hour long massage each; shuttle into Seminyak and return airport transfers and wow the luxury was very evident. The food was amazing, fresh and flavoursome and plentiful. \nThe Villa with outdoor shower and huge tub along with our own pool was pure luxury. The Villa was very well appointed with 2 x t.v's, air con, a dining/lounge area on one side of the pool and separate to the sleeping/bathroom area on the side.\nDaily application of mosquito spray & coils burning of the night meant there was no mozzies or bugs around.\nWe were very well looked after and I couldn't recommend a stay here highly enough, it was wonderful.\nIt was one of the best short holidays I have ever had and I hope to return",

Canggu and Berewa are a little quieter than Seminyak and if you want to spend a little more on accommodation Aradhana Villas is awesome and we spent a week here, with the villas well set off the road this offers a really peaceful stay with your own pool and really lovely staff who were happy to assist with any query, villa offered a great layout and had all you need for a relaxing stay. \nWe have to mention how grateful we were to have their driver take us to Kuta for a hospital visit after a fall and waited for us at no extra cost, it's these little things that make you appreciate the level of service they offer.\nAradhana Villas is only a 5-minute walk to the beach which offers great sunsets and a short walk to some great restaurants and bars. We would recommend Ahadhana Villas to anyone, we were not disappointed.",

Great location away from the busy part of Canggu. The two bedroom villa is two seperate rooms connected by an external staircase. We walked to the beach and swam and surfed every day. Only improvement to suggest - we have had better breakfasts in other villas which have had more variety of bread and croissants and fresh fruit baskets in the villa daily. I would also suggest including traditional Balinese pancakes/desserts in the high tea.",

The villa was regularly cleaned, inside and out, and by the end it felt as if it were our own home. As the villa is just one room, we had to stay outside in the heat/humid whether when our little one slept in the AC but I guess that's what the pool is for! The location is a little out of the main area of Canggu but a short walk or a cheap taxi ride and you're right in the mix. We were very happy with our stay.",

No hidden extras. \nThe dinners we had were good but not amazing (there\u2019s plenty of options within walking distance) but the convenience of being served in your villa was awesome - definitely a great option to have. \nPerfect location walking distance to surf, cafes and Finns, but on a quieter street.

It was fantastic, eggs Benedict for breakfast cooked to perfection and served in the villa afternoon teas were awesome and my favourite was the Mee goreng.\nThe rooms were serviced daily with clean sheets and towels and always done fast and efficiently and with a smile. The staff at the front desk were always friendly and quick to help with arranging transport if needed or any help with what\u2019s going on in the area.\nThese guys run a tight ship and for anyone looking for a relaxing getaway with smiles and excellent service go to Ardahana Villas.\n",

The pool had a tropical feel to it with an abundance of tropical plants and trees and had a beautiful water feature. The bathroom was stunning too with an outside bath and shower and surprisingly stays very clean even being outside! The staff were incredibly lovely and so helpful and made our anniversary very special. This villa is only a 5 min walk into the main street of Canguu where there is heaps of cafes and restaurants. Everything about our stay was perfect and the only thing I can fault is that the breakfast is a bit average but it\u2019s all included so for a free brekkie it definitely is ok. If you had to pay I would personally skip on breakfast but considering it\u2019s free than it\u2019s okay. (I had smashed avocado and pancakes. Smashed avo was good. Pancakes were ok) \n\nA big thank you to everyone that made our stay amazing! We will be back",

The villa was clean, well appointed and maintained, we stayed as part of a Luxury Escape deal so lots of extras thrown in but highly recommend the breakfast and afternoon tea every day. The stocked mini bar was an added bonus and we enjoyed a massage in the room would definitely recommend spa treatments onsite. We enjoyed dinner every evening as well leaving us free to explore some local gems for lunch (not that we needed any more food we were well fed), used the bicycles a few times and the shuttle into Seminyak and Canguu. Short walk to Berawa Beach which was great for sunset and walks to Canggu area. Staff exceptional, great English and nothing was a problem. We cannot rate highly enough and will recommend to our friends and family and hopefully return one day soon.",

We stayed as part of a Luxury Escapes deal and had lots of little extras that were great. We didn't use all the meals as we usually ate out. The breakfast provided in your villa was great. The rest of the meals were average, but fine if you need a quiet night in.The drop off service into Seminyak or the main part of Canggu was fantastic - they even booked and paid for a taxi one night when the villa car was being used. Would love to return one day. ",

This small boutique establishment provides impeccable service with all staff wanting to make our stay as easy and as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much trouble.\nThe location of the Villas to the beach was super with an easy 5 minute walk to Berawa Beach. Turn left at the ocean for a short walk to Finns Beach Club, turn right for Old Mans, Ji and The Lawn. \nVilla breakfast was included and was both tasty and  generous, fresh juices to start the day!\nWe loved how quiet it was at Aradhana, away from the hustle and bustle but close enough to enjoy any activity.\nOur thanks to all the staff.",

The villa was super clean and had everything required for a great week of relaxation away. As there are only 8 villas on the property, it was quiet and very private.  The staff were fantastic and couldn't have done any more to ensure our stay was nothing less than perfect.  We loved our time here. The added bonus of having access to their private driver should you need to be driven to a restaurant in Seminyak or back to the airport was so convenient.",

You can enjoy here if you would want your stay in a quite far from all the traffic and city culture of Bali. The staffs were incredibly sweet and was on reach on all times. The garden in each suite was the best to opt for. \n\nWe got our breakfast packed as we had an early flight and if informed earlier, they arrange for transportation to the airport. \n\nThe pool in the villa was delightful. \n\nNote: You can find many lizards in the garden and the doors. It is considered as the sacred animal to them and they do not entertain to trouble their stay :)",

The food was \u201cjaen\u201d - delicious - and the servings adequate though not huge by western standards. Quite refreshing actually! The privacy was wonderful and the quietude and peace was so restful. The occasional lowing from the cows next door in the evenings reminded us we were in paradise. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows to die for! Really enjoyed the Balinese semi outdoor bathroom and the gentle sounds of falling water from the fountains emptying into the private pool was so relaxing and comforting. The outdoor living room was large and accommodating and very comfortable... so much space! The villas are close to the beach and remarkable beach clubs like Finn\u2019s and La Laguna with a supermarket only a 5 minute bicycle ride away. Important for those little necessities like fresh mangoes and dragon fruit for your fruit drinks prepared with the blender provided! We added a little kick to ours! A big thumbs up from us to Aradhana Villas! Thank you to all the extremely friendly and helpful staff who helped make our stay truly memorable! We would DEFINITELY stay here again.",

              "text": "Just got home after a week long stay at the Aradhana Villas in Canggu. The villas are very beautiful, the pool was the standout for us as you can just relax and swim at your pleasure. We didn\u2019t see or hear any other tourists at the Villas the entire we were there, which was perfect as we just wanted privacy. The location of the bathrooms being slightly outside was really nice as well, however the mosquitoes are really bad. The staff were really helpful in that after a few nights they put a mosquito net over the bed for us- if you stay here request this the first night as unfortunately you do get eaten alive in your sleep. My feedback for this villa site would be to improve the breakfast and room service- the breakfast portions are really small, and you are only allowed one main. For the price you pay, they defiantly need to be bigger or give you the option to have multiple mains. The room service also has the same issue, and was only average. The shuttle service too is slightly misleading as more often than not, it wasn\u2019t available- and is only a drop off service. In order to improve your guests stay, these two aspects need to be improved.\n\nOverall the staff are so lovely, and the stay was very pleasant. The drivers in particular really made our stay as they are so kind. Thankyou for a wonderful stay Aradhana! We hope to return in the future. ",

The shuttle service described is misleading - it\u2019s only a drop off - this was frustrating as we\u2019d chosen this villa on the basis of not having to fuss with taxis. Breakfast range was good but you\u2019re only allowed one main. Taste was okay but portions were small. I had a nice massage but I agree it was overpriced for everywhere else in Bali, I paid 4x what I paid at the villa we chose in Ubud. Stay was fine it just didn\u2019t feel that welcoming and as this was our last stay before going home we were a bit disappointed in the service compared to the rest of our holiday ",

The staff are all so helpful and kind aswell and they will all do anything and everything possible to assist you.\nBreakfast was really nice (omelette is superior to the other options imo)\nBeach is just down the road to the right and all shops and restuarants down the road to the left.\n\nThe only problem i do have (and the reason i did note rate 5*) is that the in-house prices are ridiculously expensive.\nA 60min massage here is 400k+ rp pp, 5 min walk down the road its around 90k rp pp... Thats over 4x the price and both are just as good as eachother.\nAlso the laundry system here 19krp charge for 1 shirt and they take it down the road to get it cleaned... I went down the road myself with 10 items of clothing to be cleaned and it only cost me 8700rp.\nAbsolute rip off and actually quite irritating. \n*MAKE SURE YOU SHOP AROUND!!*",

The gardens surrounding the villa were beautiful and contributed to the laid back ambience.  Our flight was delayed by 8 hours, and we did not arrive until midnight - but Nyoman met us at the airport with his big smile. He and all of the staff were fantastic.  We thoroughly enjoyed our breakfasts by the pool each day.  There are plenty of amazing cafes in nearby Jalan Raya Pantai Berawa.",

              "text": "I was so disappointed with this villa.  All the reviews are outstanding so I can't work out whether I got the rough end of the stick or not.  Firstly our villa stunk like the drains in Bali.  We put up with it for 2 nights when I requested that we change rooms, thankfully they had a room to change us in to.  Note to you - don't stay in villa 1.  The staff did try to mask the smell but it was gross.  We moved to villa 5 which was much nicer and larger.  Also it had more sun.  I made a special request prior when I booked for a sun filled villa after reading a previous review - after moving into villa 5 I see that that request was not met, there is more sun in there.  On night 4 they didn't put the mosquito vape in our room - just left it on the desk and I didn't think much of it until I was woken up by mosquitos eating my face.  Yes I was bitten numerous amounts of times on my face - I have photos.  On the plus side the staff were lovely but they just didn't know English well which caused confusion and we sometimes got something different to what we ordered for breakfast even confirming the order with us so I would say that would be the kitchen, we would tell them but they still messed it up.  Then on our first day, we didn't even get offered afternoon tea.  I feel bad as the staff really did try and were so lovely but I paid alot of money  and worked hard for a great experience and I just didn't get it.  It was my 6th time in Bali so I'm not a novice.  The shuttle bus was a bonus.  The location is good, walking distance to some of the restaurants.  I'm trying to work out whether we just had bad luck and got the worst rooms and service.  So disappointed for the amount of money that we paid, I won't be recommending or coming back here even though we got engaged in Bali on this trip - it just wasn't the Bali experience that I have been so lucky to have in the past.  I feel sad that I have to write this review, it is honest and truthful.",

Ariani, Ketut and their wonderful staff made sure that my wife and I had everything we needed to be comfortable and relaxed for our stay. \n\nOur Villa was large, beautifully designed and completely private. Ariani and her staff helped with installing a pool fence which put our minds at ease (thank you!). \n\nThe kitchenette had everything we needed. Our rooms were very comfortable and well air conditioned.  The amenities were kept well maintained and cleaned. And the staff were very attentive to our needs.\n\nThe location was perfect. We had a small corner story 50 metres from our Villa and a larger 5-star supermarket 500 metres down the road. \n\nWe were within 20 minutes driving distance to the popular Seminyak restaurant and shopping locations. And a short walk down to the local beach.\n\nOur family loved cooling down in our private pool. We enjoyed ordering from the menu, with breakfast being a particular highlight.\n\nThanks again to Ariani, Ketut and their wonderful staff for making us feel so welcome. We will be recommending Aradhana to our friends and hope to visit you again soon!",

Quiet, peaceful and calm. We took the honeymoon/romantic package and all the services that were part of the package was provided. The breakfast was excellent and ordering from their menu for lunch/dinner also did not disappoint. The villa is ideally located a few 100 mts from the beach which also made my stay even more pleasant. The cleaning service team did a great job keeping the villa neat and cozy. I would definitely recommend to all my friends and colleagues who are looking for a nice, calm and stress-free break to consider staying here. If I do come back, I now know where I would be staying!",

The staff at Aradhana Villas were very friendly and helpful and the villa was lovely albeit it battling with a massive padlock and bundle of keys to lock/unlock doors to bedroom and bathroom. \n\nWe have some minor issues such as pool temperature as when the pool is so shaded that it\u2019s is generally unpleasant to use due to it being too cold. This means the main reason to book a pool villa is not achieved and reduces the value of the villa and holiday. Unfortunately the trees around the pool have grown to a height that the pool gets very little sun and is overly refreshing to the stage that we used it almost not at all. \n\nAlso, the food in general was inconsistent in quality and what we got might not be what we actually ordered. The banana pancakes are great but on one occasion my wife\u2019s were undercooked. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like we enjoyed our time but we did as none are big issues but enough that they could do with improvements.

Comfortable accomodation, and a short walk to the beach, where we loved the fact that it was as much a beach for the locals as for tourists.  Plenty of food options within a ten to fifteen minute walk from the villa.\n\nStaff were universally helpful and friendly, and we loved the indoor/outdoor design of the villa.  The kids loved having the pool right there - we had a chat as to whether we preferred this style of accomodation or a traditional resort and all of us agreed that this was the better option.\n\nWe would be more than happy to come back again.",

Inside has everything you need, comfortable bed, air-conditioning, and a huge bathroom with shower, separate bath, and all amenities supplied. \n\nRoom service is available, food is very good, service quick, and reasonably priced.

Was extremely impressed by the service of the staff; always so happy to see me and genuinely cared about the quality of my stay.\n\nThe food and drinks at the villa were quite good and arrived exactly when I had scheduled them, as well as 6 bottles of complimentary drinking water resupplied every day. \n\nI could go on describing everything I thought that was good about this place but I recommend you book and see for yourself, everything they promise you will receive, you will not be disappointed. \n\nThanks again Aradhana team cya again soon hopefully !",

There are a number of restaurants and bars within walking distance. Plenty of choices for all tastes.\n\nThe staff are incredible, friendly, helpful and efficient.

We didn't want to leave our villa - the bedroom was huge, the pool was much bigger than I thought and the temperature was amazing, and the bath could have soaked me for hours. Nice 10 minute walk to the main strip and the beach where there were lots of food options. Only slight downside was there were still lots of mosquitos despite the staff refilling the mosquito repellant each afternoon. \nFood was great although the indonesian food in town was incredible, so make sure you try that too. Loved our massage as well - they come to your villa and set up the table. \nStaff were delightful the entire time - definitely a highlight. \nWe will be back!",

Your own private pool within wonderful grounds, staff exceptional especially Ariani (Ops. Manager) who couldn't do enough for us.  Interesting fact they did not have a restaurant, all meals and afternoon tea delivered to the villa.  Did miss not seeing other people there and although it is small would have been nice to meet others. There was a shuttle run into town so could go to the supermarket and by wine and beer. Quite near the beach and was a could walk along it to see other parts of Canggu.  The Hindu Christmas was being celebrated while we were there and was interesting.  Private pick-up to and from airport good.",

I only wished I could have just stayed here the entire time. I did not want to leave!! Our incoming flight was delayed and even though I got to the hotel around 1 am, they were so unbelievably friendly and went out of their way to make sure I had what I needed. I gasped when he opened the door to my personal oasis, complete with a stunning pool surrounded by fountains and greenery. I can't even describe how peaceful it was. Outdoor rain shower, soaking tub, super comfy bed, breakfast served to your outdoor kitchen...need I go on? Whether you are going for a Romantic getaway, a girl's weekend, or even alone to escape...this place will be perfect. As I left to go to my friends' hotel the next day, the staff even lined up to wave goodbye to me. I want to go back already. ",

              "text": "We have just enjoyed five very relaxing and enjoyable days at Aradhana Villas. For us, the villa was a perfect place to chill out and in fact we did not leave the villa for three days. The private pool was excellent, the bed comfortable and the bedroom was adequately air-conditioned.  We found the staff to be very helpful and we were reminded on arrival that the transportation service they provided was a \"drop off\" service only - so we had no issues in relation to this, in fact one day when one of the drivers was ill, management arranged a taxi into Seminak for us at their expense. Plus on departure we were transported to our new accommodation at Nusa Dua all as part of the service. \n\nNow the meals, we really could not complain, I was not a fan of their coffee and after we requested fruit juices to be made without water - they were good. The fact that the mini bar was topped up everyday at no cost was great - and the fact that the villa had a small bar fridge was also handy. Not much good for making ice, but all you had to do was ask room service if you needed ice. \n\nI read that someone commented on the noise from other villas - yes at times but nothing of concern - it's a resort where people relax and enjoy themselves.  I can honestly say that we are now in a 5 star resort at Nusa Dua for a week and I sincerely wish that we were still at Aradhana Villas - we enjoyed our stay that much.\n\nAradhana, is a little out of the way, but you can still walk to restaurants if need be.\n\nWould we stay there again.....a resounding YES vote from us......",

But even this paled in comparison with the staff. Literally no request was too much, and each and every person we met was extremely courteous and helpful.\nCanggu is easy to get around after a few days, still pretty busy with scooters flying around, but not as hectic as Seminyak or Kuta. There's till plenty of cabs if you'd rather not walk or ride yourself, and there are cafe's & restaurants everywhere (Our favourite was Betelnut, about 5-10 mins away by taxi, or the drop-off service Aradhana provides).\nWe wish we could have stayed longer as we were really starting to know our way around, but family called..... It just guarantees that we'll be trying to be back, hopefully with kids in tow so they can fall in love too!!!!",

The location is great - the street it is situated on is very quiet (but you can't hear any street noise from the villa anyway), you can walk to the beach & if keen, you can walk to some shops & cafes/restaurants otherwise the drivers on site are always happy to drive you somewhere. The food is always fresh & tasty & the room service is terrific with the villa cleaned & serviced everyday to perfection & the mini bar restocked daily with free soft drink & beer. \nOne of the things we loved the most about Aradhana were all of the staff - to dearest Ratna, Cita & Sugita - thank you so much for your beautiful accommodation & kindness & constant smiles. \nWe would also like to recommend Wayan (also known as Joe to his friends) to anybody who would like a tour around Bali or driven somewhere in Bali for shopping/lunch/dinner/otherwise. His knowledge of Bali is good, his English is great & he is friendly & very funny. \nWe only left a few days ago but we miss you already & we can't wait to see you all again next year! \n\nNikki, Ben and Vicki.",

              "text": "It\u2019s so much easier to share a positive traveling experience, but let\u2019s be honest travel hiccups are also part of the adventure that is woven into the landscape. From start to finish, a series of unfortunate incidents at Aradhana Villas made our experience there, less than satisfactory.  Individually each of these experiences can be easily overlooked, collectively is another story.  Here\u2019s mine\u2026\nAbout:  Our villa at Aradhana featured a comfortable, yet stylish space with an open-air living area complete with a pool, amid sumptuous verdant foliage, and colorful flowers.  The spacious bed and bathrooms are enhanced by a design that reflects traditional Balinese charm with artisan touches. At first glance the zen-like atmosphere looks like a secluded refuge, until you hear the sound of lively voices from guests at the neighboring villa that make you feel like you are in a shared space. The location of Aradhana villas is a little off the beaten track, so transportation to nearby boutiques, restaurants and cafes, is essential.          \nNeed to Know: I remember reading on Aradhana\u2019s website, that complimentary transportation is included. In fact, right on their homepage and then again, under their \u201clocation\u201d tab it boasts, \u201cOur complimentary transportation make it even easier.\u201d Hmm, if only our experience reflected that claim.  During our brief visit, it seems that we had the supreme misfortune of having to negotiate every single ride, which was not something we particularly enjoyed. \nWhen we first arrived at Aradhana, we were informed by the desk clerk, who was also showing us our room, that in order to schedule a ride they required up to two-hour advance notice.  It is important to mention that an unfortunate mix-up at the airport with their driver, prior to our arrival to Aradhana, made us later than expected. Their driver went to the international terminal to pick us up, rather than the domestic terminal, where we were waiting. I had notified Aradhana in advance with the flight details, and intentionally provided the origin of the flight, to avoid any confusion when we arrived.  \nAfter we offered our explanation about this unlucky incident at the airport, we pleaded with the desk clerk that a two-hour advance notice would be unrealistic.  Fortunately she agreed with us and offered transportation almost immediately. \nHowever. It was a different story the following morning, when one person from our group of three, requested a ride to Old Man\u2019s beach to go surfing. It was denied, presumably due to their two-hour advance notice rule. Instead, we shared a taxi together, since two of us were heading out to visit Tanah Lot.  \nLater on that same day, when we phoned up Aradhana for a return ride from Canggu, much to our dismay the clerk said Aradhana only offers drop-off service, and then suggested we contact a taxi to arrange a ride back.  I reasoned with her and eventually she said, \u201clet me check on it for you,\u201d followed by \u201cyes we can offer you a ride.\u201d \nWe made several more attempts to request a ride that was met with the same resistance. In the end, they did reluctantly agree. It was a frustrating experience and because their website advertises complimentary transportation, we felt misled. If we had known about their strict policy prior to booking our room, in addition to, the out of the way location, we would have found somewhere else to stay during our Canggu visit. \nFood and Service: Complimentary afternoon tea is the best part, if only they could remember the order. The first day it arrived sans the pot of coffee we requested. No big deal. The second day, they forgot our order, twice. We were able to overlook this inconvenience when it finally arrived nearly an hour and a half later. Light and crispy mushroom fritters, arranged on a bed of mixed greens, with a sauce similar to aioli. It was delicious. \nAnother small sign that lacked attention to detail was the breakfast service. The first morning, our meal arrived on schedule, but if the lukewarm coffee and cold scrambled eggs was any indication, it probably waited for someone to pick it up and send it out. The following morning, fortunately our breakfast and pot of coffee was delivered hot. It was tasty, served with a seasonal fruit platter and much appreciated before leaving on a long flight. :)  \nIn the end, each of these faux pas could be overlooked individually, but collectively it points to a staff that's not well trained and appears to have no one in charge.   \nEtiquette Sidebar: I presumed this woman was the owner or manager of Aradhana, who I met, while waiting for a taxi, at the front desk. She never formally introduced herself to me, so I am not sure if she has a management role at Aradhana. But she apologized for our mix-up at the airport that had caused our delay the previous day. To my astonishment, she followed the apology with something that came as a complete surprise. Imagine the look on my face when she says, \u201cNext time you come to Aradhana, remember to tell us that your flight is domestic.\u201d  It left me stone cold for a moment, until I found my composure to tell her she was sadly mistaken. So I said, \u201cI did notify you in advance that it was a domestic flight.\u201d  \nIt felt like my reply fell on deaf ears because an awkward silence followed without an acknowledgement to my response. Now that I am back home with a little distance between us, I can almost find the humor in her absurd comment.  Almost.\nIt\u2019s a shame, aside from the location, there are good features at Aradhana, the design, comfortable rooms amid tropical foliage, a nearby beach\u2026 but when a place doesn\u2019t deliver you can\u2019t help but feel disappointed.  \nAnyway, on a brighter note, it was only a short stop over, and the rest of the trip to Bali was like a dream come true that felt nothing short of magical. I will be back to Canggu, but there is nothing from my experience that would draw me back to Aradhana Villas.",

              "text": "We enjoyed a 7 night stay here in May at a great rate thanks to a deal site in Australia.\n\nOur first impression of our Aradhana villa was WOW! The outdoors area is beautifully presented in typical Balinese style with tropical gardens, plants, flowers, statues and tasteful decorator pieces.  The spacious, covered and tiled Sala is well furnished with quality rubber-wood Balinese furniture - dining table, 2 seater cushion upholstered lounge & single chair with coffee & side tables. There's also a cupboard topped with a tv.\nThoughtful inclusions such as umbrellas were a nice addition.\n\nThe pool was accessible from both the bedroom and the Sala,  and was a perfect size for the villa, with a decked lounger area & outdoor shower nearby. Tropical gardens & water-spouting pool statues combined to make the whole outdoor area one of tropical beauty and luxury. \n\nThe kitchenette was well appointed with everything we needed or could need.  We did have a small issue with items such as glasses and cups being cleared away with our used crockery  and not replaced until morning housekeeping. Of course, it was only a call to reception to have new items delivered but at the odd time (eg early morning cup of tea) it was a small inconvenience that could have been avoided. \n\nThe mini fridge is stocked with soft drinks and a couple of local beers, all complimentary on a daily basis. A great inclusion!\nPlenty of bottled drinking water is supplied daily as well. I found it very thoughtful that extra waters were also provided daily in the bathroom for teeth brushing. It's the little things like this that make Aradhana such a delightful place to stay. \n\nThe villa bedroom boasted an very comfortable Asian-firm king bed with quality linens and the luxurious bonus of clean sheets each day of our stay. Yes - EVERY SINGLE DAY! What a delightful indulgence! Once again quality wood furniture, good bedside tables & lamps perfectly suitable for reading! Yay for that! \n\nThere was a small desk area, a wardrobe with hanging space, shelving and a small safe, a tv unit with drawers and ample space to unpack our belongings for the week. For those who've mentioned lack of bedroom storage - this was easily solved by storing suitcases on the wardrobe top shelf, designed for just this purpose. \n\nThe air con worked great and we left it on night & day with doors closed to enjoy comfortable nights' sleeps and the odd afternoon rest in the cool.  With the doors kept closed this kept out the tropical bugs as well.  Kudos to staff for providing everything required to keep mosquitos & other tropical bugs at bay with coils lit day & night.  Having said that, we didn't find bugs an issue at all.  \n\nThe outside bathroom was beautifully appointed and quite spotlessly clean. Even the pipes under the vanity unit were shined! I kid you not! The outdoor rain head shower was decadent, as was the deep free standing claw foot bathtub surrounded by lush green gardens. The generous array of quality toiletries, replenished daily, was quite simply superb.  \n\nThe entire setup of the Aradhana villa is simple yet beautifully executed.  It combines functionality with Balinese style in perfect proportion. We had complete privacy and rarely heard other guests. The staff are genuinely warm & friendly and actively seek to ensure your stay is everything you desire.  So much so we had a daily visit from a lovely lady on the management team - complete with pen and pad - to note any problems or issues we had! \n\nMassive kudos and thank you to the most efficient and timely housekeeping service provision I've seen in years.  I swear the young man who re-made our bed with aforementioned clean sheets daily, did so with a ruler for exactitude! A mini army of housekeeping staff did everything not only perfectly, but as we were usually at the villa at the time, with complete unobtrusiveness.\n\nAll the staff were quite delightful to talk with, their warmth and smiles patently genuine. For Bali, this has become rarer ... no doubt due to the overrun of tourism. And let's be honest here, not all tourists - by a long shot - are pleasant people to have to deal with. Aradhana staff are obviously trained from the outset to a very high standard and this is reflected in each interaction.  \n\nUpon arrival there was a small information compendium in our villa which gave some local customs and general info. Interesting but not particularly helpful.\n\nIf I could suggest a couple of small improvements they would be to provide more information on what's within walking distance of the villas.  We didn't realise until late in our stay there was a Mini mart and restaurants all within easy walking distance.  I understand the desire to keep guests as a \"captive audience\" - particularly where food and beverages are concerned - is important to a property's financial bottom line .... however, providing guests with as much information and options as possible should come first. Yes a free shuttle service to Seminyak is provided but we would have jumped at the opportunity to \"walk out\" for an evening meal occasionally.\n\nMy second small criticism was that the food, and we ate all meals in-house, could have been a little more consistent in quality.  It was very good on most occasions, but a few times there came in as sub average. We did particularly enjoyed the very generous breakfasts, which were consistently fabulous. \nKudos must also be given for very fair pricing and an extensive menu that surely caters to most palates.  \n\nThe location of Aradhana is perfect for those who see the villa as the destination - and it was delightful to spend a week relaxing in the tropical beauty of own private villa and pool.  Aradhana is perfect for couples, honeymooners and family groups, even singles looking for chill space. It's the perfect place to regain a sense of peace and balance. \n\nWould we return to this slice of Balinese Heaven? In a heartbeat!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93",

              "text": "Wirklich eine sehr, sehr sch\u00f6ne Unterkunft. Wir haben eine Nacht hier \u00fcbernachtet und hatten einen Privat-Pool, der vom Bad aus zu erreichen ist und vom Wohnbereich als auch vom Schlafzimmer. Das Schlafzimmer war das einzige was innenliegend war, der Wohnbereich und das Bad im Freien aber \u00fcberdacht. Das bringt nat\u00fcrlich zahlreiche Geckos und \u00c4hnliches mit sich :) An die Geckos hatten wir uns nach 1,5 Wochen auf Bali gew\u00f6hnt, aber sie waren nat\u00fcrlich da. Auch viele M\u00fccken gab es (klar - alles im Freien) und Tausende von Ameisen scharrten sich im Wohnbereich und um den Pool. Das l\u00e4sst sich wahrscheinlich im Freien nicht vermeiden, aber ist nat\u00fcrlich trotzdem irgendwie doof.\n\nSauber war alles, die Mitarbeiter waren sehr, sehr nett und das Essen (welches im eigenen Wohnbereich serviert wird nach vorheriger telefonischer Bestellung) sehr lecker. Und das beste Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck, was wir auf ganz Bali hatten! \n\nF\u00fcr die Insekten und Co. und daf\u00fcr, dass man sich doch etwas eingeengt f\u00fchlt, gibt es einen Punkt Abzug. Das eigene \"Areal\" ist zwar recht gro\u00df, allerdings komplett zugemauert. Es ist zwar alles super sch\u00f6n bepflanzt, sodass man recht wenig Beton sieht, aber irgendwie f\u00fchlt man sich doch ein klein wenig beengt. Dadurch dass auch alles \u00fcberdacht ist, kommt auch nur sehr wenig Sonne rein und es ist etwas dunkel. F\u00fcr eine oder zwei N\u00e4chte prima - f\u00fcr einen l\u00e4ngeren Aufenthalt, w\u00fcrde ich aber vielleicht doch ein anderes Hotel w\u00e4hlen (nur wegen dem \"geschlossenen Areal\", sonst ist das Hotel wirklich klasse)!",

              "text": "Nous avons s\u00e9journ\u00e9 4 nuits dans une villa deux chambres avec piscine, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 surclass\u00e9s.\n\nL'ext\u00e9rieur de la villa est tr\u00e8s beau : jolie terrasse sous un toit balinais, piscine tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able dans un grand jardin bien entretenu. L'int\u00e9rieur nous a un peu d\u00e9\u00e7us : mat\u00e9riaux et mobilier un peu basiques et chambre sans \u00e2me, c'est vraiment dommage.\n\nLe service est assez moyen : arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 13h30 sous une chaleur torride, la chambre ne pouvait etre prise qu.\u00e0 14h, on nous a donc laiss\u00e9 nous d\u00e9brouiller, dans un quartier pas terrible, pour trouver de quoi patienter. L'\u00e9quipe est sympathique mais malheureusement peu efficace : nombreux appels dans la chambre pour confirmer une demande, niveau d'anglais tr\u00e8s juste, aucune d\u00e9cision m\u00eame la plus basique ne peut \u00eatre prise sans quils doivent en r\u00e9f\u00e9rer au manager, ce qui complique beaucoup les choses...\n\nl'organisation est \u00e9galement peu pratique : le petit-dejeuner et son horaire doivent \u00eatre command\u00e9s la veille au soir. En vacances, je n'ai pas tellement envie de devoir pr\u00e9voir un horaire auquel je vais me r\u00e9veiller le lendemain et pouvoir d\u00e9jeuner. Idem sur la navette : il faut la r\u00e9server 2h avant, et m\u00eame comme cela c'est parfois compliqu\u00e9 et il faut insister pour avoir le chauffeur demand\u00e9. Ils vous d\u00e9posent mais ne viennent pas vous chercher. Nous \u00e9tions en basse saison et l'\u00e9quipe \u00e9tait loin d'\u00eatre d\u00e9bord\u00e9e.\n\nLe quartier, \u00e9loign\u00e9 de tout, n'est pas tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able : sorte de petite d\u00e9charge juste \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des villas, des trucs en travaux un peu partout autour, vraiment pas terrible. \n\nUn avis assez mitig\u00e9 donc, peut-\u00eatre influenc\u00e9 par l'\u00e9tablissement exceptionnel \u00e0 Ubud dans lequel nous avions pass\u00e9 quelques jours avant d'arriver \u00e0 Aradhana. Je dirais que l'ensemble est correct, mais que le prix pratiqu\u00e9 n'est pas totalement coh\u00e9rent avec la qualit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du s\u00e9jour.",

Boisson de bienvenue et de d\u00e9part offertes. Nous avons pu reculer notre Check out de 2h pour profiter de la piscine. Une vraie journ\u00e9e de luxe pour un prix raisonnable. Nous n'aurions jamais pu avoir de telles prestations en France pour ce prix. Seul b\u00e9mol, une petite odeur d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able.",
